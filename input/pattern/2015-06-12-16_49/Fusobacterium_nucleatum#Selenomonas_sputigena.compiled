TI  - Analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult Norwegian patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult Norwegian patients. METHODS: Samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21) apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). DNA was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all cases. In teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were Dialister invisus (71%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). In chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were P. endodontalis (100%), D. invisus (89%), Parvimonas micra (78%), and Solobacterium moorei (78%). In teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were D. invisus, P. endodontalis, S. moorei, Propionibacterium acnes, and Streptococcus species (all in 69%). None of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (P > .05), except for Selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (P = .04). No taxa were found in significantly higher levels in any conditions (P > .05). Cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. Therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). Age was inversely associated with the GO. Plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with GO, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of GO. The gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the GO. Statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of GO were detected for Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium and Selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. Significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species Eubacterium alactolyticum, Campylobacter concisus, C. gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, F. mortiferum, F. nucleatum, and F. varium from the more enlarged lesions (GO >3).
TI  - The relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with Down's syndrome.
AB  - Gingival inflammation in Down's syndrome children (DS) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-DS children. Abnormalities in host response to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. However, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response to oral microorganisms in DS by age has not been determined. The objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. Sera were obtained from 75 DS subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified PMA Index (M-PMA). Antibody titers to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Treponema denticola (Td), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Selenomonas sputigena (Sel), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Streptococcus mitis (Mi) were determined using the micro-ELISA. DS subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did normal children the same age. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, P < 0.0001) existed in the relationship between M-PMA score and plaque score for subjects in the G1 age group (deciduous dentition). At G1, the average antibody titers to Aa, Mi, and Fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. In addition, IgG antibody titers to Pg, Aa, Fn, Sel, and Mi correlated significantly with the M-PMA scores in the G1 age group. There was a correlation between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. IgG antibody titers to Pg, Aa, Sel, and Mi increased significantly with increasing M-PMA score. Furthermore, the IgG antibody titers to Pg were higher (P < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the DS no-disease group. The IgG antibody titers to Pg at G3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to G1 (preschool children). The IgM antibody titers to Aa at G3 were higher (P < 0.05) when compared to G1. This study suggests that colonization by Aa and Fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in DS patients under 5 years old. Colonization by Pg, Aa, Sel, and Mi in DS appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ICI 194660, CAS 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. They included Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), Prevotella bivia (n = 11), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), Clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated species and genera, e.g. Selenomonas sputigena and Clostridium symbiosum. Bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, Clostridium species, including C. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. Meropenem was especially active against Bacteroides gracilis (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Prevotella disiens (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml), Fusobacterium nucleatum (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml) and Veillonella parvula (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml). The results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
TI  - Adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. The purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different GTR membranes. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the test membranes. In part I of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. Six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part II of this study. The membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37 degrees C. Membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls. At 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (RTF) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. Each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml RTF to detach adherent bacteria. The detached adherent bacteria were counted using a Petroff-Hausser chamber. Data were analyzed by using the SAS program. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. Results showed S. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. Selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. Polyglactin 910 had significantly (P < 0.05) lower S. mutants adherence than either the ePTFE or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  - Phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium OMIZ-W1. None of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas sputigena, Treponema pectinovorum, T. socranskii, or Wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methylester). Phenylalanine was essential for the growth of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium timidum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. With the exception of E. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic microorganisms to hypothiocyanite produced by lactoperoxidase.
AB  - The susceptibility of Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Eubacterium yurii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas sputigena, Wolinella recta to hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) produced by the lactoperoxidase system was tested. Results showed a decrease of bacterial survival rate after OSCN- exposure, with an intra- and inter-species variability from 0 to 95% for C. ochracea, 34-100% for E. corrodens, 0-83% for E. yurii, 1-15% for F. nucleatum, 8-61% for P. micros, 0-100% for P. intermedia, 0-44% for S. sputigena and 0-8% for W. recta. The survival rate did not correlate with the NADH/OSCN- oxidoreductase activity present in the lysed bacteria (r = -0.3248; N = 15; NS).
TI  - Coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas flueggei, Selenomonas infelix, Selenomonas noxia, and Selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 Selenomonas strains, including S. sputigena (24 strains), S. flueggei (10 strains), S. infelix (5 strains), and S. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Propionibacterium, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species. Selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with Actinomyces naeslundii PK984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. In contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. Each fusobacterium strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. Coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by EDTA, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. Likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. Heating the fusobacteria at 85 degrees C for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. Heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. Although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective. The strains of F. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. Collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. The contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. The subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. Using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. Active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. The control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. Bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. Similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. The proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of Bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. sputigena and Eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of B. intermedius and E. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species had increased. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. The proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis II and Campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. Humoral antibody response to A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena significantly increased in a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. Antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. Crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Polyclonal B-cell activation induced by extracts of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from periodontally diseased sites.
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine whether gram-negative bacteria frequently isolated from periodontally diseased sites contained polyclonal B-cell activators. Polyclonal B-cell activation, which results in nonspecific activation of multiple B-cell clones was analyzed by a hemolysis-in-gel assay designed to detect a broad range of antibody specificities. Extracts from numerous bacterial strains, including Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas sputigena, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were tested. Extracts of the above organisms were found to stimulate polyclonal antibody responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, although the magnitude of stimulation varied among the extracts. Optimal antibody-forming cell responses were found at stimulator doses between 5 and 1,000 micrograms/ml. We conclude that the resident gram-negative subgingival flora associated with periodontal lesions possesses potent polyclonal B-cell activators. These activators may contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing B lymphocytes to produce antibody, osteolytic factors, or both and possibly other mediators of inflammation.
TI  - Medium for selective isolation of Fusobacterium nucleatum from human periodontal  pockets.
AB  - A selective medium, CVE agar, was developed for the isolation of Fusobacterium nucleatum from subgingival plaque of periodontally diseased patients. The medium contained 1.0% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems), 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.2% glucose, 0.02% L-tryptophan, 1.5% agar, and 5% defibrinated whole sheep blood. Erythromycin and crystal violet were added as the selective inhibitory agents at concentrations of 4 and 5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The medium permitted almost total recovery of F. nucleatum when compared with a nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by nonselective medium and suppressed the recovery of most remaining species by 6 to 8 orders of magnitude. Microorganisms suppressed to a lesser degree included Selenomonas sputigena, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and some strains of Peptostreptococcus. The distinct colonial morphology of F. nucleatum on CVE agar made differentiation relatively easy when contaminants were present. With this medium, F. nucleatum was enumerated from 278 subgingival plaque samples and accounted for less than 1.0 to greater than 25% of the cultivatable microbiota.
TI  - Microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  - A study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. Samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. Gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. Peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. Gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. Bacteriodes ochraceus, other Bacteroides species, Selenomonas sputigena, and Campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. Haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and Veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. The data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. This might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
TI  - Compact liquid nitrogen storage system yielding high recoveries of gram-negative  anaerobes.
AB  - A simple and compact system suitable for the preservation of fragile gram negative anaerobes and other bacteria in liquid N2 has been developed. Polypropylene straws used as specimen containers can be used easily within glove bags of anaerobic chambers, and their small size greatly increases the number of cultures which can be stored. Ancillary equipment and methods developed are described. The overall system was tested, using Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Selenomonas sputigena. Various basal suspending fluids and cryoprotective supplements were studied. With fast rates of freezing and thawing, survival recoveries of the test microorganisms ranged from 80 to 100 percent of the input colony-forming units in a complex medium broth base without cryoprotective agent addition, and they consistently were 100 percent when 0.4 mM polyvinylpyrrolidine was used. Overall, cryoprotection by polyvinyl pyrrolidine was superior to that from glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide, the latter yielding recoveries similar to or less than those obtained with no cryoprotectant additive. All microorganisms were recoverable after storage for 1 year.
TI  - Total viable count and differential count of vibrio (campylobacter) sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, selenomonas sputigena, bacteroides ochraceus and veillonella in the inflamed and non inflamed human gingival crevice.
