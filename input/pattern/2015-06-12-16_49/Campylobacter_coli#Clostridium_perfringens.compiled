TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  - The present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). Samples were screened for Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. Microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log CFU/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (P < 0.05), whereas the other FABs contained , 25 CFU/25 ml microorganisms. Unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7 to 14.1%) or pH (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. Despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and B. cereus (detected in all FABs) were present in some products. B. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (P < 0.05). The finding that spore-forming B. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality FAB products. New strategic quality management plans for various FABs are needed.
TI  - Expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in Canada.
AB  - Enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in Canada and globally. Understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. Expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously, to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information is difficult or expensive to obtain. Thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. The elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. Experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. Estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. Transmission was attributed primarily to food for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Trichinella spp., all three Vibrio spp. categories explored, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as Campylobacter spp., four Escherichia coli categories, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. Water was the primary pathway for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and Shigella spp. Consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. This study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for Canada, considering all possible transmission routes. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and E. coli subgroups in Canada.
TI  - Characteristics of Metroxylon sagu resistant starch type III as prebiotic substance.
AB  - Resistant starch type III (RS3 ) was produced from sago (Metroxylon sagu) and evaluated for its characteristics as a prebiotic. Two RS3 samples designated sago RS and HCl-sago RS contained 35.71% and 68.30% RS, respectively, were subjected to hydrolyses by gastric juice and digestive enzymes and to absorption. Both sago RS and HCl-sago RS were resistant to 180 min hydrolysis by gastric acidity at pH 1 to 4 with less than 0.85% hydrolyzed. Both samples were also resistant toward hydrolysis by gastrointestinal tract enzymes and intestinal absorption with 96.75% and 98.69% of RS3 were recovered respectively after 3.5 h digestion and overnight dialysis at 37 degrees C. Sago RS3 supported the growth of both beneficial (lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and pathogenic microbes (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter coli, and Clostridium perfringens) in the range of 2.60 to 3.91 log10 CFU/mL. Hence, prebiotic activity score was applied to describe the extent to which sago RS3 supports selective growth of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains over pathogenic bacteria. The highest scores were obtained from Bifidobacterium sp. FTDC8943 grown on sago RS (+0.26) and HCl-sago RS (+0.24) followed by L. bulgaricus FTDC1511 grown on sago RS (+0.21). The findings had suggested that sago RS3 has the prebiotic partial characteristics and it is suggested to further assess the suitability of sago RS3 as a prebiotic material.
TI  - An assessment of the human health impact of seven leading foodborne pathogens in  the United States using disability adjusted life years.
AB  - SUMMARY We explored the overall impact of foodborne disease caused by seven leading foodborne pathogens in the United States using the disability adjusted life year (DALY). We defined health states for each pathogen (acute illness and sequelae) and estimated the average annual incidence of each health state using data from public health surveillance and previously published estimates from studies in the United States, Canada and Europe. These pathogens caused about 112 000 DALYs annually due to foodborne illnesses acquired in the United States. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (32 900) and Toxoplasma (32 700) caused the most DALYs, followed by Campylobacter (22 500), norovirus (9900), Listeria monocytogenes (8800), Clostridium perfringens (4000), and Escherichia coli O157 (1200). These estimates can be used to prioritize food safety interventions. Future estimates of the burden of foodborne disease in DALYs would be improved by addressing important data gaps and by the development and validation of US-specific disability weights for foodborne diseases.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from Australian dairy farm environments.
AB  - The ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. In dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. This survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3 caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in Victoria, Australia. A total of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. The prevalence of the Bacillus cereus group, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cronobacter, Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and Yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. The 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the B. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by Cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. The highest occurrence of any pathogen was the B. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. Fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. Salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. Out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. All of the CPS were Staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. Pathogenic Listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 L. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 L. monocytogenes-positive water sample. Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a single raw milk sample. Cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms, predominantly in feed samples. No Y. enterocolitica was detected. Results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. Monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as Cl. perfringens and B. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.
TI  - Surveillance for zoonotic and selected pathogens in harbor seals Phoca vitulina from central California.
AB  - The infection status of harbor seals Phoca vitulina in central California, USA, was evaluated through broad surveillance for pathogens in stranded and wild-caught animals from 2001 to 2008, with most samples collected in 2007 and 2008. Stranded animals from Mendocino County to San Luis Obispo County were sampled at a rehabilitation facility: The Marine Mammal Center (TMMC, n = 175); wild-caught animals were sampled at 2 locations: San Francisco Bay (SF, n = 78) and Tomales Bay (TB, n = 97), that differed in degree of urbanization. Low prevalences of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium were detected in the feces of stranded and wild-caught seals. Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli were more prevalent in the feces of stranded (58% [78 out of 135] and 76% [102 out of 135]) than wild-caught (42% [45 out of 106] and 66% [68 out of 106]) seals, whereas Vibrio spp. were 16 times more likely to be cultured from the feces of seals from SF than TB or TMMC (p < 0.005). Brucella DNA was detected in 3.4% of dead stranded harbor seals (2 out of 58). Type A influenza was isolated from feces of 1 out of 96 wild-caught seals. Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis neurona, and type A influenza was only detected in the wild-caught harbor seals (post-weaning age classes), whereas antibody titers to Leptospira spp. were detected in stranded and wild-caught seals. No stranded (n = 109) or wild-caught (n = 217) harbor seals had antibodies to phocine distemper virus, although a single low titer to canine distemper virus was detected. These results highlight the role of harbor seals as sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment.
TI  - Proportion of illness acquired by foodborne transmission for nine enteric pathogens in Australia: an expert elicitation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimates of the burden of illness acquired from food inform public health policy and prioritize interventions. A key component of such estimates is the proportion of illnesses that are acquired by foodborne transmission. In view of the shortage of requisite data, these proportions are commonly obtained through a process known as expert elicitation. We report findings from an elicitation process used to assess the importance of the foodborne transmission route for nine pathogens in Australia, circa 2010. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven experts were asked to estimate the proportion of illness acquired by five transmission routes: food, environmental, water, person, and zoonotic, together with a 90% certainty interval for foodborne transmission. Foodborne estimates and intervals from each expert were combined using both modified triangular and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distributions, in @Risk version 6, to generate final distributions from which median estimates and 95% Credible Intervals (CrI) were calculated. RESULTS: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) was the only pathogen believed to have an important zoonotic transmission route, while norovirus, hepatitis A virus, non-STEC pathogenic E. coli, and Shigella spp. were all thought to be primarily spread from person to person. Foodborne transmission was the main route for Clostridium perfringens (98%, CrI: 84-100), Listeria monocytogenes (98%, CrI: 86-100), nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (72%, CrI: 50-87), and Campylobacter spp. (77%, CrI: 60-90). Foodborne estimates using the modified triangular distribution had wider CrI than these calculated using the PERT distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Foodborne proportions for most pathogens in this study were the same or lower than those estimated circa 2000 in Australia, with the greatest decline for non-STEC pathogenic E. coli. Inclusion of certainty intervals from experts helps to quantify the precision of foodborne proportions. A decline in estimates of the foodborne proportion for common pathogens will influence final estimates of the burden of illness acquired from food.
TI  - Use of essential oils and extracts from spices in meat protection.
AB  - The hydro distillation method was used in this study to get essential oils (EOs)  from cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.), clove (Eugenia caryohyllata) and Elecampane (Inula helenium L.) and the co-hydro distillation method (addition of fatty acid ethyl esters as extraction cosolvents) to get functional extracts (EFs). The MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and the MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) were determined on five pathogenic strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Toxoplasma Gondi). The results showed that essential oils of cumin and clove and their functional extracts are effective on concentrations from 500 mg/L to 750 mg/L. The essential oils with functional extracts were used on meat samples at three different concentrations: 750, 1,500 and 2,250 muL. The cumin essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log UFC/g with the application of 750 muL, the clove essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log UFC/g with the application of 2,250 muL and the cumin and clove functional extracts got a reduction of 3.6 log UFC/g. By chromatography, eugenol was identified in the clove oil, cuminaldehyde in the cumin oil and the isoalactolactones and alactolactones in the elecampane oil as main compounds on the chemical composition of the essential oils and functional extracts obtained.
TI  - The impact of major earthquakes and subsequent sewage discharges on the microbial quality of water and sediments in an urban river.
AB  - A series of large earthquakes struck the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 2010-2011. Major damage sustained by the sewerage infrastructure required direct discharge of up to 38,000 m(3)/day of raw sewage into the Avon River of Christchurch for approximately six months. This allowed evaluation of the relationship between concentrations of indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and F-RNA phage) and pathogens (Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium) in recreational water and sediment both during and post-cessation of sewage discharges. Giardia was the pathogen found most frequently in river water and sediment, although Campylobacter was found at higher levels in water samples. E. coli levels in water above 550 CFU/100 mL were associated with increased likelihood of detection of Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium, supporting the use of E. coli as a reliable indicator for public health risk. The strength of the correlation of microbial indicators with pathogen detection in water decreased in the following order: E. coli>F-RNA phage>C. perfringens. All the microorganisms assayed in this study could be recovered from sediments. C. perfringens was observed to accumulate in sediments, which may have confounded its usefulness as an indicator of fresh sewage discharge. F-RNA phage, however, did not appear to accumulate in sediment and in conjunction with E. coli, may have potential as an indicator of recent human sewage discharge in freshwater. There is evidence to support the low-level persistence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, but not Campylobacter, in river sediments after cessation of sewage discharges. In the event of disturbances of the sediment, it is highly probable that there could be re-mobilisation of microorganisms beyond the sediment-water exchange processes occurring under base flow conditions. Re-suspension events do, therefore, increase the potential risk to human health for those who participate in recreational and work-related activities in the river environment.
TI  - Evaluation of a multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial and viral enteropathogens in stool samples of paediatric patients.
AB  - We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay, the Seeplex Diarrhoea ACE detection, that simultaneously detects 15 enteric pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., toxin B producer Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, adenovirus, Group A rotavirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus. We compared this assay with clinical methods routinely used in our laboratory, for detecting enteropathogens in stool samples collected from 245 paediatric patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis. We recovered 61 bacterial pathogens and 121 enteric viruses with our laboratory assays, while we detected 78 bacteria and 167 viruses with the molecular assay. We calculated specificity and sensitivity for both methods after analysis of discordant results and demonstrated greater sensitivity for multiplex PCR than for our routine methods, with the exception of Salmonella spp. and toxigenic C. difficile detection. The multiplex PCR assay proved to be a reliable tool to directly detect the most common enteropathogens in stool samples but with some limitations.
TI  - Disease-outcome trees, EQ-5D scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the United States.
AB  - Measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. They provide a means of comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. We present detailed disease-outcome trees and EQ-5D scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the United States (Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio, and Yersinia enterocolitica). We estimate over 5800 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of L. monocytogenes and V. vulnificus, compared to 125 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of T. gondii, 26 for E. coli O157:H7, 16 for Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 14 for Y. enterocolitica. The remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 QALYs lost per 1000 cases. In total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in QALY loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total QALY loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. These estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. This study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - [Diagnosis and control of human food poisoning outbreaks].
AB  - Medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. Bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially Norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. Culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. These new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified, and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.
TI  - Pathogenic microbiological baseline survey of pork carcasses in Taiwan.
AB  - From 2004 to 2010, pork carcass swabs from state-inspected slaughter plants in Taiwan were intermittently analyzed to determine the prevalence of selected pathogenic microorganisms associated with foodborne illness. The prevalences of Staphylococcus aureus each year from 2006 to 2010 were 6.6, 10.8, 5.1, 6.4, and 7.4%, respectively, while those of Listeria monocytogenes were 1.2% in 2004, 1.3% in 2005, and 3.5% in 2008. The prevalences of Clostridium perfringens were 0.9% in 2004, 3.2% in 2005, and 1.1% in 2008. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli had a higher recovery rate than the other surveyed microorganisms, with prevalences during 2004, 2005, and 2008 of 21.1, 13.7, and 8.1%, respectively. Salmonella strains were analyzed each year, and their prevalences ranged between 3.0 and 6.9%. Derby, Typhimurium, Anatum, Choleraesuis, and Agona were the five serovars most frequently identified among the Salmonella isolates. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was not detected in 2004, 2005, or 2010. Routine baseline surveying of pork carcasses to determine the prevalence of selected pathogens of concern for food safety can provide valuable information regarding the effectiveness of the slaughtering procedures or the need for interventions.
TI  - Immunity to bacterial infection in the chicken.
AB  - Bacterial infections remain important to the poultry industry both in terms of animal and public health, the latter due to the importance of poultry as a source of foodborne bacterial zoonoses such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. As such, much focus of research to the immune response to bacterial infection has been to Salmonella. In this review we will focus on how research on avian salmonellosis has developed our understanding of immunity to bacteria in the chicken from understanding the role of TLRs in recognition of bacterial pathogens, through the role of heterophils, macrophages and gammadelta lymphocytes in innate immunity and activation of adaptive responses to the role of cellular and humoral immunity in immune clearance and protection. What is known of the immune response to other bacterial infections and in particular infections that have emerged recently as major problems in poultry production including Campylobacter jejuni, Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale and Clostridium perfringens are discussed.
TI  - Coinfection in acute gastroenteritis predicts a more severe clinical course in children.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of enteric pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among hospitalized children in a large Italian hospital, to measure the incidence of coinfections, and to compare the clinical characteristics of those infected with one versus multiple agents. A prospective study was conducted from March 2010 to April 2011 at the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital in Rome, Italy. All patients between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted to the Pediatric Department with a diagnosis of AGE were eligible for enrollment. Two stool samples for each patient were tested for gastrointestinal pathogens. We summarized the clinical severity of episodes, describing the duration of diarrhea, duration and frequency of vomiting, fever, and severity of dehydration. All the patients underwent medical evaluation with estimation of dehydration. One or more etiological agents were detected in 151 out of 232 patients (65.1%), while we did not detect any etiological agent in 81 (34.9%). Rotavirus was detected in 96 (63.6%), adenovirus in 17 (11.2%), norovirus in 7 (4.6%), toxin-producing Clostridium difficile in 23 (15.2%), Salmonella spp. in 15 (9.9%, B group in 12/15 and D group in 3/15), C. perfringens in 12 (7.9%), Campylobacter spp. in 6 (4%), and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) in 2 (1.3%). In 27 children out of 151 (17.9%), we found evidence of coinfection. Coinfection with rotavirus and toxin-producing C. difficile was the most common (63%). Children with coinfection had a more severe clinical presentation and had a higher probability to be severely dehydrated, independently of age and living community type.
TI  - Ranking the disease burden of 14 pathogens in food sources in the United States using attribution data from outbreak investigations and expert elicitation.
AB  - Understanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards  across the food supply is critical for a risk-based national food safety system. This study was conducted to estimate the U.S. health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then rank the resulting 168 pathogen-food combinations. These pathogens examined were Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, Salmonella enterica, Toxoplasma gondii, and all other FoodNet pathogens. The health burden associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of the cost of illness and loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from acute and chronic illness and mortality. A new method for attributing illness to foods was developed that relies on both outbreak data and expert elicitation. This method assumes that empirical data are generally preferable to expert judgment; thus, outbreak data were used for attribution except where evidence suggests that these data are considered not representative of food attribution. Based on evaluation of outbreak data, expert elicitation, and published scientific literature, outbreak-based attribution estimates for Campylobacter, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, and Yersinia were determined not representative; therefore, expert-based attribution were included for these four pathogens. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of attribution data assumptions on rankings. Disease burden was concentrated among a relatively small number of pathogen-food combinations. The top 10 pairs were responsible for losses of over $8 billion and 36,000 QALYs, or more than 50 % of the total across all pairs. Across all 14 pathogens, poultry, pork, produce, and complex foods were responsible for nearly 60 % of the total cost of illness and loss of QALYs.
TI  - Garlic derivative propyl propane thiosulfonate is effective against broiler enteropathogens in vivo.
AB  - Two experiments were carried out to study the effects of dietary supplementation  with the garlic (Allium sativum)-derived product propyl propane thiosulfonate (PTS-O) on the intestinal log(10) number of copies of enteropathogens in broiler chickens, together with their intestinal morphology and growth performance. The additive had no significant effect on feed intake at any dose assayed. In experiment 1 (1 to 21 d of age), the BW of chickens fed on 45 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet was higher (P < 0.01) than that of controls. Birds fed on diets containing 45 and 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet had improved (P < 0.01) feed:gain ratios compared with the controls at 21 d of age. Ileal villus height, width and surface area, mucosal thickness, and muscular layer thickness were considerably greater (P < 0.01) than control values in chickens fed 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet. The Clostridium perfringens log(10) number of counts was not significantly affected at any dose assayed. The inclusion of PTS-O at both concentrations (45 and 90 mg/kg of diet) resulted in lower (P < 0.01) log(10) number of copies of ileal Salmonella spp. and crop enterobacteria and Escherichia coli. The inclusion of 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet also resulted in lower (P < 0.01) enterobacteria and E. coli log(10) numbers of copies in the ileal and cecal contents, respectively. The number of copies of Campylobacter jejuni was not significantly affected. In experiment 2 (15 to 28 d of age), lower (P < 0.01) log(10) number of copies of Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni were determined in the ileal contents of chickens fed on diets containing 135 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet. The addition of 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet lowered (P < 0.01) only the number of copies of ileal Salmonella spp. This investigation confirmed previous in vitro data and showed that PTS-O lowered the intestinal numbers of enteropathogens and improved the ileal histological structure and productive parameters of broilers.
TI  - Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - Consumption of foods containing Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. Given the fact that over the past decade, Canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA on foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada. Between January 2007 and December 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). These foods were screened for: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, S. aureus, Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella spp., and Yersinia spp. S. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. The S. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. Methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. These findings indicate that the presence of S. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although MRSA was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.
TI  - Temporal flux and spatial dynamics of nutrients, fecal indicators, and zoonotic pathogens in anaerobic swine manure lagoon water.
AB  - Confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) often use anaerobic lagoons for manure treatment. In the USA, swine CAFO lagoon water is used for crop irrigation that is regulated by farm-specific nutrient management plans (NMPs). Implementation of stricter US environmental regulations in 2013 will set soil P limits; impacting land applications of manure and requiring revision of NMPs. Precise knowledge of lagoon water quality is needed for formulating NMPs, for understanding losses of N and C in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions, and for understanding risks of environmental contamination by fecal bacteria, including zoonotic pathogens. In this study we determined year-round levels of nutrients and bacteria from swine CAFO lagoon water. Statistical analysis of data for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), inorganic and organic C, total N, water-soluble and total minerals (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, and Zn) and bacteria (Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., and staphylococci) showed that all differed significantly by dates of collection. During the irrigation season, levels of total N decreased by half and the N:P ratio changed from 9.7 to 2.8. Some seasonal differences were correlated with temperature. Total N and inorganic C increased below 19 degrees C, and decreased above 19 degrees C, consistent with summer increases in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions. Water-soluble Cu, Fe, and Zn increased with higher summer temperatures while enterococci and zoonotic pathogens (Campylobacter, Listeria, and Salmonella) decreased. Although their populations changed seasonally, the zoonotic pathogens were present year-round. Increasing levels of E. coli were statistically correlated with increasing pH. Differences between depths were also found. Organic C, total nutrients (C, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, N, P, and Zn) and C. perfringens were higher in deeper samples, indicating stratification of these parameters. No statistical interactions were found between collection dates and depths.
TI  - Potentially pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance in bioaerosols from  cage-housed and floor-housed poultry operations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are used in animal confinement buildings, such as cage-housed (CH) and floor-housed (FH) poultry operations, to lower the likeliness of disease transmission. In FH facilities, antibiotics may also be used at sub-therapeutic levels for growth promotion. Low levels of antibiotic create a selective pressure toward antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in chicken fecal bacteria. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare bacteria and AMR genes in bioaerosols from CH and FH poultry facilities. METHODS: Bioaerosols were collected from 15 CH and 15 FH poultry operations, using stationary area samplers as well as personal sampling devices. Bacteria concentrations were determined by genus- or species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AMR genes were detected using endpoint PCR. RESULTS: Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus spp. were significantly higher in bioaerosols of FH poultry operations than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.001) while Clostridium perfringens was significantly higher in area bioaerosols of CH operations than FH area bioaerosols (P < 0.05). Campylobacter spp. were detected only in bioaerosols of FH facilities. Zinc bacitracin resistance gene, bcrR, erythromycin resistance gene, ermA, and tetracycline resistance gene, tetA/C, were more prevalent in bioaerosols of FH facilities than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria are more concentrated and most AMR genes are more prevalent in bioaerosols of FH poultry operations, where growth-promoting antibiotics may be used.
TI  - Enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats: diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control.
AB  - This report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats, with an emphasis on Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli associated with granulomatous colitis in Boxers. Veterinarians are challenged when attempting to diagnose animals with suspected bacterial-associated diarrhea because well-scrutinized practice guidelines that provide objective recommendations for implementing fecal testing are lacking. This problem is compounded by similar isolation rates for putative bacterial enteropathogens in animals with and without diarrhea, and by the lack of consensus among veterinary diagnostic laboratories as to which diagnostic assays should be utilized. Most bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting diarrhea, and injudicious administration of antimicrobials could be more harmful than beneficial. Salmonella and Campylobacter are well-documented zoonoses, but antimicrobial administration is not routinely advocated in uncomplicated cases and supportive therapy is recommended. Basic practices of isolation, use of appropriate protective equipment, and proper cleaning and disinfection are the mainstays of control. Handwashing with soap and water is preferred over use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers because spores of C. difficile and C. perfringens are alcohol-resistant, but susceptible to bleach (1:10 to 1:20 dilution of regular household bleach) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide. The implementation of practice guidelines in combination with the integration of validated molecular-based testing and conventional testing is pivotal if we are to optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats.
TI  - Physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in Greece and its public health implications.
AB  - Ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. To evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100 ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of Epirus were studied. The following microbiological parameters were determined: Total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp., Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens. E. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. Samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. Aeromonas spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter sp. and V. cholerae were not detected. Spore forms of C. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's P. aeruginosa and Yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. The presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. In view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens in Hawaiian coastal streams--associations with fecal indicators, land cover, and water quality.
AB  - This work aimed to understand the distribution of five bacterial pathogens in O'ahu coastal streams and relate their presence to microbial indicator concentrations, land cover of the surrounding watersheds, and physical-chemical measures of stream water quality. Twenty-two streams were sampled four times (in December and March, before sunrise and at high noon) to capture seasonal and time of day variation. Salmonella, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus were widespread -12 of 22 O'ahu streams had all five pathogens. All stream waters also had detectable concentrations of four fecal indicators and total vibrio with log mean +/- standard deviation densities of 2.2 +/- 0.8 enterococci, 2.7 +/- 0.7 Escherichia coli, 1.1 +/- 0.7 Clostridium perfringens, 1.2 +/- 0.8 F(+) coliphages, and 3.6 +/- 0.7 total vibrio per 100 ml. Bivariate associations between pathogens and indicators showed enterococci positively associated with the greatest number of bacterial pathogens. Higher concentrations of enterococci and higher incidence of Campylobacter were found in stream waters collected before sunrise, suggesting these organisms are sensitive to sunlight. Multivariate regression models of microbes as a function of land cover and physical-chemical water quality showed positive associations between Salmonella and agricultural and forested land covers, and between S. aureus and urban and agricultural land covers; these results suggested that sources specific to those land covers may contribute these pathogens to streams. Further, significant associations between some microbial targets and physical-chemical stream water quality (i.e., temperature, nutrients, turbidity) suggested that organism persistence may be affected by stream characteristics. Results implicate streams as a source of pathogens to coastal waters. Future work is recommended to determine infectious risks of recreational waterborne illness related to O'ahu stream exposures and to mitigate these risks through control of land-based runoff sources.
TI  - Inactivation of indicators and pathogens in cattle feedlot manures and compost as determined by molecular and culture assays.
AB  - Accurate and conservative information about pathogen inactivation rates is needed as the basis for safe manure management on beef cattle feedlots. The survival of indicators and pathogens in faecal pen manure, stockpiled manure and manure compost was measured with autochthonous indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, total coliforms) and pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni) using culture and/or real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods. Additionally, the manures were incubated at 20, 37, 50 and 60 degrees C in microcosms to quantify the persistence of autochthonous microorganisms and selected process performance surrogates (Clostridium sporogenes, green fluorescent protein-labelled E. coli and L. monocytogenes). Estimated qPCR cell counts indicated that up to four orders of magnitude more target cells were present compared with the culturable counts. Corresponding T(90) estimates were up to sixfold higher. This study demonstrates the benefits of nucleic acid-based quantification of pathogen inactivation in cattle manures and concludes that the concurrent analysis of microorganisms by molecular and culture methods provides complementary value.
TI  - Review of enteric outbreaks in prisons: effective infection control interventions.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify documented outbreaks, worldwide, of enteric illness in correctional facilities over the last 10 years to understand the epidemiology of the outbreaks and explicitly identify effective infection control measures. STUDY DESIGN: Review of literature and outbreak investigation reports. METHODS: Computer-aided searches of literature databases and systematic searches of government websites were completed to identify relevant outbreak reports. Reference lists were hand-searched to validate the electronic search methodology. Reports identified through personal communications with public health officials were also included. RESULTS: Of the 72 outbreaks meeting the inclusion criteria, 76% and 21% were associated with bacterial agents and viral agents, respectively. The majority of outbreaks were associated with Salmonella (n=20), Clostridium perfringens (n=14), norovirus (n=14), pathogenic Escherichia coli (n=10) and Campylobacter spp. (n=5). Transmission was primarily foodborne (67%). During an outbreak, the most common control measures included limiting movements of ill inmates and staff, and their exclusion from kitchen duty. The most common retrospectively reported preventative recommendations included monitoring food temperatures and effective infection control procedures. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to monitor food temperatures to prevent enteric outbreaks in prisons. Training in safe food handling should be offered to inmates who work in the kitchen. Enteric outbreaks are best controlled by effective infection control practices, while active surveillance and early diagnosis may prevent further spread of illness.
TI  - Microbiological quality of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in Nunavik, Quebec: a pilot study.
AB  - This pilot study was aimed at documenting the presence of fecal indicators and enteric pathogens in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) from 6 communities in Nunavik, Quebec. One to four 2 kg samples of mussels were collected at low tide in each community. Samples were investigated by enumeration methods for the fecal indicators enterococci, Escherichia coli, F-specific coliphages, Clostridium perfringens, and by molecular identification for the pathogens norovirus, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari, verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (particularly serovar O157:H7), Shigella spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica. In 5 communities, the presence of Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. was also tested by microscopy and molecular methods and that of Toxoplasma gondii was tested by molecular methods. Apart from small quantities of Clostridium perfringens in 2 samples, no bacterial or viral pathogens were detected in the mussels. Toxoplasma gondii was also not detected. However, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 18% and 73% of the samples investigated for these pathogens, respectively. When considering the indicators and the viral and bacterial pathogens investigated, the mussels examined were of good microbiological quality, but considering the presence of potentially zoonotic protozoa, it should be recommended that consumers cook the molluscs well before eating them.
TI  - Companion animals symposium: microbes and gastrointestinal health of dogs and cats.
AB  - Recent molecular studies have revealed complex bacterial, fungal, archaeal, and viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in Firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.
TI  - Comparison of selected nutrients and bacteria from common contiguous soils inside and outside swine lagoon effluent spray fields after long-term use.
AB  - Swine (Sus scofa domestica) lagoon effluent is a valuable resource. In the U.S. Mid-South it is applied from April to September to fertilize grass hay in spray-irrigated fields. Lagoon levels of nutrients and bacteria, and soil levels of nutrients have been documented, but little was known of effluent bacterial levels in soil. The present study examined levels of selected effluent bacteria and nutrients in soils inside and outside spray fields after >15 yr of effluent irrigation. Samples were collected February to March 2009 from contiguous soils spanning adjacent irrigated and nonirrigated areas. Separate soil cores for bacterial and nutrient tests were collected in pairs <10 cm apart. Five cores each were collected at 15-m intervals and combined, respectively, to comprise inside and outside samples from each of 20 soils (four each from five farms/spray fields). Analyses of data combined across all soils showed higher pH and Mehlich-3-extracrable (M3-) P, Mg, K, Na, Cu, and Zn inside than outside spray fields, while total N, total C, M3-Ca, and M3-Mn did not differ. Bacterial levels were higher inside than outside spray fields for heterotrophic plate counts, thermotolerant coliforms, Staphylococcus spp., and Clostridium perfringens, but levels of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were not different. Cultural presence/absence tests for three pathogens (Listeria spp., Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp.) detected only Listeria spp., which did not differ inside (23% positive samples) and outside (28% positive). Molecular tests detected all three pathogens at low levels that were not different inside and outside. We found no evidence of cumulative buildup of Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., or Salmonela s. in spray field soils.
TI  - Quantitative in vitro assay to evaluate the capability of yeast cell wall fractions from Trichosporon mycotoxinivorans to selectively bind gram negative pathogens.
AB  - Yeast cell wall fractions have been proposed to bind enteropathogenic bacteria. The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative assay by measuring the optical density as growth parameter of adhering bacteria. The exponential growth phase of adhering bacteria was determined by optical density reading and compared with the colony count (CFU/mL). A linear regression was compiled and the bacterial number bound to the yeast cell wall product could be determined. Further focus was the investigation of a yeast cell wall from strain Trichosporon mycotoxinivorans (MTV) for its ability to bind gram negative Salmonella, E. coli and Campylobacter strains and gram positive probiotic bacteria of the genera lactobacilli and bifidobacteria as well as gram positive Clostridium perfringens quantitatively. The gram negative probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 was also investigated. Seven out of 10 S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis strains adhered to the cell wall product with an amount between 10(3) and 10(4) CFU/10 mug. Four out of 7 E. coli strains showed an average binding capability (10(2) CFU/10 microg) whereas 4x10(3) E. coli F4 cells bound per 10 mug yeast cell wall. E. coli 0149 K91, E. coli 0147 K89, C. jejuni and C. perfringens as well the genera lactobacilli and bifidobacteria did not bind to the yeast cell wall. E. coli Nissle 1917 was bound with 2x10(2) CFU/10 mug. These results demonstrate that cell wall from MTV can be used to differentially bind E. coli spp. and Salmonella spp. up to 8x10(4) CFU/10 mug. Thus certain yeast cell walls may prevent enteric infections caused by selective bacteria. This methodical approach would be an accurate tool in the feed industry for quality control of yeast cell wall products.
TI  - A 17-year review of foodborne outbreaks: describing the continuing decline in England and Wales (1992-2008).
AB  - Systematic national surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks effectively serves the development of public health policy on food safety. The Health Protection Agency has maintained a collaborative surveillance system for foodborne outbreaks in England and Wales since 1992. Up to 2008, 2429 foodborne outbreaks were identified, described and analysed for changes over time. Salmonella spp. accounted for half of the outbreaks, although the proportion of these decreased over the surveillance period. Similarly, the proportion of outbreaks caused by Clostridium perfringens decreased, while those attributed to Campylobacter spp. and Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 increased. Although poultry meat was the most frequently implicated food vehicle in outbreaks followed by miscellaneous foods and red meats, the proportion of outbreaks attributed to meats in fact decreased over time but those linked to miscellaneous foods did not. Over the surveillance period, the proportion of outbreaks linked to eggs and S. Enteritidis non-phage-type 4, particularly in food service establishments, increased, highlighting the importance of this organism/setting/vehicle association. Contributory factors in most outbreaks were cross-contamination, inadequate heat treatment, and inappropriate food storage. This study describes the overall decline in foodborne outbreaks, providing evidence that the introduction and adherence to effective control measures provide the best means of minimizing the risk of foodborne infection.
TI  - Implications of faecal indicator bacteria for the microbiological assessment of roof-harvested rainwater quality in southeast Queensland, Australia.
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the suitability of Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens for assessing the microbiological quality of roof-harvested rainwater and assessing whether the concentrations of these faecal indicators can be used to predict the presence or absence of specific zoonotic bacterial or protozoan pathogens. From a total of 100 samples tested, 58%, 83%, and 46% of samples were found to be positive for, respectively, E. coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens spores, as determined by traditional culture-based methods. Additionally, in the samples tested, 7%, 19%, 1%, 8%, 17%, and 15% were PCR positive for Aeromonas hydrophila lip, Campylobacter coli ceuE, Campylobacter jejuni mapA, Legionella pneumophila mip, Salmonella invA, and Giardia lamblia beta-giardin genes, respectively. However, none of the samples was positive for E. coli O157 lipopolysaccharide, verocytotoxin 1, and verocytotoxin 2 and Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst wall protein genes. The presence or absence of these potential pathogens did not correlate with any of the faecal indicator bacterial concentrations as determined by a binary logistic regression model. The roof-harvested rainwater samples tested in this study appeared to be of poor microbiological quality, and no significant correlation was found between the concentration of faecal indicators and pathogenic microorganisms. The use of faecal indicator bacteria raises questions regarding their reliability in assessing the microbiological quality of water and particularly their poor correlation with pathogenic microorganisms. The presence of one or more zoonotic pathogens suggests that the microbiological analysis of water should be performed and that appropriate treatment measures should be undertaken, especially in tanks where the water is used for drinking.
TI  - Presence of zoonotic pathogens in physico-chemically characterized manures from hog finishing houses using different production systems.
AB  - Hog production has been intensified in Eastern Canada, by 50% over the last 20years. Wastes are now managed with conventional production systems (slatted floor), litter systems or source separation systems. We studied the presence of total and fecal coliforms, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the manure of all of these production systems. The concentrations of the studied zoonotic pathogens did not differ between the conventional and the litter systems investigated. The source separation system yielded separated solid and liquid fractions. Total and fecal coliforms, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were found in the solids and the liquid fractions of a source separation system.Campylobacter species were not detected in the liquid fractions. Zoonotic pathogens are therefore, found in the manure of Eastern Canadian hog finishing houses equipped either with conventional, sawdust litter or source separation systems. Pathogens inactivation will require changes in manure management practices or the use of manure disinfection methods.
TI  - Prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens in racing sled dogs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is highly prevalent in racing sled dogs, although the underlying causes are poorly understood. HYPOTHESIS: Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile Toxin A and B are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs. ANIMALS: One hundred and thirty-five sled dogs. METHODS: Freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. Samples were visually scored for diarrhea, mucus, blood, and melena. CPE and C. difficile Toxin A and B were detected by ELISA. Samples were cultured for C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157; Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. were detected via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. Salmonella was isolated from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. C. perfringens and C. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. Dogs were more likely to test positive for CPE during than before racing (18.8 versus 5.5%, P = .021); however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly associated with hematochezia or diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Sled dogs participating in long distance racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not associated with common enteropathogens. It is possible that diarrhea and hematochezia represent the effect of prolonged exercise on the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Characterization of selected nutrients and bacteria from anaerobic swine manure lagoons on sow, nursery, and finisher farms in the Mid-South USA.
AB  - Swine (Sus scrofa domestica) production in the Mid-South USA comprises sow, nursery, and finisher farms. A 2007 packing plant closure started a regional shift from finisher to sow and nursery farms. Changes in manure stored in lagoons and land-applied as fertilizer were expected but were unknown because nutrient and bacterial levels had not been characterized by farm type. The objectives of this study were to quantify selected nutrients and bacteria, compare levels by farm types, and project impacts of production shifts. Nutrients and bacteria were characterized in 17 sow, 10 nursery, and 10 finisher farm lagoons. Total and thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli (Migula) Castellani and Chalmers, Enterococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens (Veillon and Zuber) Hauduroy et al., Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., and Salmonella spp. were evaluated. Highest levels were from total coliforms (1.4- 5.7x10(5) cfu 100 mL(-1)), which occurred with E. coli, Campylobacter spp., C. perfringens, and Enterococcus spp., in every lagoon and virtually every sample. Lowest levels were from Listeria spp. and Salmonella spp. (<or=1.3x10(2) most probable number [MPN] 100 mL(-1)), detected in 81 and 89% of lagoons and 68 and 64% of samples, respectively. Sow farm levels were higher for all except Listeria spp. and Salmonella spp., which were lower (1.4x10(1) and 2.8x10(1) MPN 100 mL(-1), respectively) and only slightly below their respective levels from nursery farms (1.1x10(2) and 3.4x10(1) MPN 100 mL(-1)). Shifting from finisher to nursery farm would not affect bacterial levels, but shifting to sows would. Either shift would reduce NPK and N:P and suggest modification of nutrient management plans.
TI  - Enteric bacterial pathogen detection in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) is associated with coastal urbanization and freshwater runoff.
AB  - Although protected for nearly a century, California's sea otters have been slow to recover, in part due to exposure to fecally-associated protozoal pathogens like Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona. However, potential impacts from exposure to fecal bacteria have not been systematically explored. Using selective media, we examined feces from live and dead sea otters from California for specific enteric bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile and Escherichia coli O157:H7), and pathogens endemic to the marine environment (Vibrio cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and Plesiomonas shigelloides). We evaluated statistical associations between detection of these pathogens in otter feces and demographic or environmental risk factors for otter exposure, and found that dead otters were more likely to test positive for C. perfringens, Campylobacter and V. parahaemolyticus than were live otters. Otters from more urbanized coastlines and areas with high freshwater runoff (near outflows of rivers or streams) were more likely to test positive for one or more of these bacterial pathogens. Other risk factors for bacterial detection in otters included male gender and fecal samples collected during the rainy season when surface runoff is maximal. Similar risk factors were reported in prior studies of pathogen exposure for California otters and their invertebrate prey, suggesting that land-sea transfer and/or facilitation of pathogen survival in degraded coastal marine habitat may be impacting sea otter recovery. Because otters and humans share many of the same foods, our findings may also have implications for human health.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Seasonal relationships among indicator bacteria, pathogenic bacteria, Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, and hydrological indices for surface waters within an agricultural landscape.
AB  - The South Nation River basin in eastern Ontario, Canada is characterized by mixed agriculture. Over 1600 water samples were collected on a bi-weekly basis from up to 24 discrete sampling sites on river tributaries of varying stream order within the river basin between 2004 and 2006. Water samples were analyzed for: densities of indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, total and fecal coliforms), the presence of pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp.), and densities of parasite Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts. Relationships between indicator bacteria, pathogens, and parasite oocysts/cysts were overall weak, seasonally dependent, site specific, but primarily positive. However, L. monocytogenes was inversely related with indicator bacteria densities. Campylobacter, Salmonella, Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were most frequently detected in the fall. E. coli O157:H7 was detected at a very low frequency. Exploratory decision tree analyses found overall that E. coli densities were the most utilitarian classifiers of parasite/pathogen presence and absence, followed closely by fecal coliforms, and to a lesser extent enterococci and total coliforms. Indicator bacteria densities that classified pathogen presence and absence groupings, were all below 100 CFU per 100 mL(-1). Microorganism relationships with rainfall indices and tributary discharge variables were globally weak to modest, and generally inconsistent among season, site and microorganism. But, overall rainfall and discharge were primarily positively associated with indicator bacteria densities and pathogen detection. Instances where a pathogen was detected in the absence of a detectable bacterial indicator were extremely infrequent; thus, the fecal indicators were conservative surrogates for a variety of pathogenic microorganisms in this agricultural setting. The results from this study indicate that no one indicator or simple hydrological index is entirely suitable for all environmental systems and pathogens/parasites, even within a common geographic setting. These results place more firmly into context that robust prediction and/or indicator utility will require a more firm understanding of microorganism distribution in the landscape, the nature of host sources, and transport/environmental fate affinities among pathogens and indicators.
TI  - Real-time PCR detection of pathogenic microorganisms in roof-harvested rainwater  in Southeast Queensland, Australia.
AB  - In this study, the microbiological quality of roof-harvested rainwater was assessed by monitoring the concentrations of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides spp. in rainwater obtained from tanks in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Samples were also tested using real-time PCR (with SYBR Green I dye) for the presence of potential pathogenic microorganisms. Of the 27 rainwater samples tested, 17 (63%), 21 (78%), 13 (48%), and 24 (89%) were positive for E. coli, enterococci, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides spp., respectively. Of the 27 samples, 11 (41%), 7 (26%), 4 (15%), 3 (11%), and 1 (4%) were PCR positive for the Campylobacter coli ceuE gene, the Legionella pneumophila mip gene, the Aeromonas hydrophila lip gene, the Salmonella invA gene, and the Campylobacter jejuni mapA gene. Of the 21 samples tested, 4 (19%) were positive for the Giardia lamblia beta-giardin gene. The binary logistic regression model indicated a positive correlation (P < 0.02) between the presence/absence of enterococci and A. hydrophila. In contrast, the presence/absence of the remaining potential pathogens did not correlate with traditional fecal indicators. The poor correlation between fecal indicators and potential pathogens suggested that fecal indicators may not be adequate to assess the microbiological quality of rainwater and consequent health risk.
TI  - Enteric bacteria isolated from acute diarrheal patients in the Republic of Korea  between the year 2004 and 2006.
AB  - In an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the Republic  of Korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. Among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic Escherichia coli, especially, EAEC was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Shigella species. Distinct seasonality was found in V. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed no age-specific patterns. However, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and B. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. However, both pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. Moreover, S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. In conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.
TI  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an Excel-based software program, Risk Ranger. It is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. Risk scores provided by the tool were characterized as low, medium and high. Also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. Low risk scores were obtained for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) for low risk population. High risk scores were obtained for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). Moderate risk scores for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). Scores for Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for S. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. Campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas Y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. High risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes (high risk population), EHEC (high risk population) or S. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with Campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and HEV (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). Salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. Preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. Only Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes and E. coli EHEC gave moderate risk ratings in case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. These results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a Food Safety Management System.
TI  - A national survey of the microbiological quality of retail raw meats in Australia.
AB  - A national survey of the microbiology of meat (ground beef and diced lamb) at the retail level in Australia was undertaken. For ground beef samples (n = 360), the mean aerobic plate count (APC) was 5.79 log CFU/g, and Escherichia coli was detected in 17.8% of samples; the mean population for these positive samples was 1.49 log CFU/g. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 96.9% of samples (mean for positive samples, 3.01 log CFU/g), and coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 28.1% of samples (mean for positive samples, 2.18 log CFU/g). For diced lamb samples (n = 360), the mean APC was 5.71 log CFU/g, and E. coli was detected in 16.7% of samples (mean for positive samples, 1.67 log CFU/g). Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 91.1% of samples (mean for positive samples, 2.85 log CFU/g), and coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 22.5% of samples (mean for positive samples, 2.34 log CFU/g). Salmonella was recovered from 4 (1.1%) of the 360 ground beef samples (isolates were Salmonella Typhimurium phage types), and E. coli O157 was recovered from 1 (0.3%) of 357 samples; Campylobacter and Clostridium perfringens were not recovered from any of the 91 and 94 samples tested, respectively. Salmonella was recovered from 2 (0.6%) of the 360 diced lamb samples (serovars were Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Typhimurium), Campylobacter was recovered from 1 (1.1%) of 95 samples, and C. perfringens was recovered from 1 (1.1%) of 92 samples.
TI  - Large-scale freshwater microbiological study: rationale, results and risks.
AB  - A fifteen-month fortnightly survey of microbial health risk indicators and pathogens has been carried out at 25 freshwater recreational and water supply sites distributed throughout New Zealand, for: E. coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, F-RNA bacteriophage, somatic coliphage, human enteroviruses, human adenoviruses, Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Sites were selected to represent five geographical areas covering New Zealand and five categories of predominant environmental impact: birds, dairy farming, forestry/undeveloped, municipal, and sheep/pastoral farming. Six of the sites were also source waters for treated drinking-water supplies. Of the indicators, E. coli was detected in 99 % of all samples, with somatic coliphage being detected most of the time (89 %). Of the pathogens tested, Campylobacter and human adenoviruses were inferred to be the most likely to cause human waterborne illness to recreational freshwater users. Using data from all sites, an estimated 5 % of notified campylobacteriosis cases in New Zealand could be attributable to water contact recreation. The critical value for E. coli as an indicator of increased Campylobacter infection is in the range of 200-500 E. coli per 100 ml. This result has been used to derive new national water quality guidelines for recreational fresh water in New Zealand.
TI  - A systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. DATA SOURCES: Studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. Hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. Specific organisms under review were Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus. Data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. Where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. A decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical UK population. Finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of GPs, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. RESULTS: Good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. Indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. The significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. Economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that PCR for Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli O157 is potentially very successful in identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. Less is known about the benefits of testing for B. cereus, C. perfringens and S. aureus. Further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.
TI  - Pathogen and indicator variability in a heavily impacted watershed.
AB  - Water samples were collected from 36 locations within the Grand River Watershed,  in Southwestern Ontario, Canada from July 2002 to December 2003 and were analyzed for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and thermophilic Campylobacter spp. A subset of samples was also analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., culturable human enteric viruses, and Clostridium perfringens. Storm and snowmelt events were sampled at two locations including a drinking water intake. For the majority of the events, the Spearman rank correlation test showed a positive correlation between E. coli levels and turbidity. Peaks in pathogen numbers frequently preceded the peaks in numbers of indicator organisms and turbidity. Pathogen levels sometimes decreased to undetectable levels during an event. As pathogen peaks did not correspond to turbidity and indicator peaks, the correlations were weak. Weak correlations may be the result of differences in the sources of the pathogens, rather than differences in pathogen movement through the environment. Results from this investigation have implications for planning monitoring programs for water quality and for the development of pathogen fate and transport models to be used for source water risk assessment.
TI  - Behaviour of pathogenic and indicator bacteria during urban wastewater treatment  and sludge composting, as revealed by quantitative PCR.
AB  - Two enteric pathogens, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni, and two bacteria commonly used as indicators, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, were monitored using quantitative real-time PCR during municipal wastewater treatment and sludge composting. The results were compared with those obtained using standard culture methods. A reduction of all bacteria was observed during wastewater treatment and during the thermophilic phase of composting. However, the bacterial groups studied behaved differently during the process, and the main differences were observed during biological treatment in activated sludge basins. In particular, Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni survived better during activated sludge treatment than E. coli. C. jejuni was the most resistant to wastewater treatment among the four bacterial groups. Overall, differences in survival were observed for all bacteria studied, when submitted to the same environmental pressure. This holds both for differences between indicators and pathogenic bacteria and between pathogenic bacteria. These results show the difficulty in defining reliable indicators.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  - The development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. The important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. Systematic monitoring of fecal bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. Clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. The temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees C, compared with the 4 degrees C location, where these species were found in lower numbers. Moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas was found only at this last location. The temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of Campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a pH close to 6. Spore forms of C. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.
TI  - Microbiological safety of retail vacuum-packed and modified-atmosphere-packed cooked meats at end of shelf life.
AB  - A study of retail modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed cooked ready-to-eat meats was undertaken from September through mid-November 2003 to determine the microbiological quality at the end of shelf life and to establish any risk factors in the production, storage, and display of this product. Examination of 2,981 samples using Microbiological Guidelines criteria revealed that 66% were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiology quality, 33% were of unsatisfactory quality mainly due to high aerobic colony counts and Enterobacteriaceae concentrations, and 1% were of unacceptable quality due to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes at 100 CFU/g or higher (27 samples; range of 10(2) to 106 CFU/g) and Campylobacter jejuni (1 sample), indicating a risk to health. All samples at the end of the shelf life had satisfactory (<20 CFU/g) and/or acceptable (<102 CFU/g) levels of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens, four samples (<1%) had unsatisfactory levels of Escherichia coli (range of 102 to 106 CFU/g) and 5.5% of the samples contained L. monocytogenes at <20 CFU/g (4.8%) or between 20 and 100 CFU/g (0.7%). More samples of chicken (45%; 224 of 495 samples), beef (43%; 160 of 371 samples), and turkey (41%; 219 of 523 samples) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable quality compared with ham (23%; 317 of 1,351 samples) or pork (32%; 67 of 206 samples). Twelve different L. monocytogenes typing characters (serotype-amplified fragment length polymorphism type-phage type) were evaluated for isolates recovered from samples of unacceptable quality, and the 1/2-IX-NT type was recovered from almost half (48%) of these samples. Salmonella was not detected in any samples examined. Risk factors identified for cooked meats that were microbiologically contaminated more frequently included vacuum packaging, packaging on retail premises, slicing, temperature not monitored in display units, and no hazard analysis system in place. Results from this study also suggest that the shelf life assigned to some modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed meats may not be appropriate.
TI  - The beta-defensin gallinacin-6 is expressed in the chicken digestive tract and has antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Food-borne pathogens are responsible for most cases of food poisoning in developed countries and are often associated with poultry products, including chicken. Little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken digestive tract and their efficacy. In this study, the expression of chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (Gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens were investigated. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed high expression of Gal-6 mRNA in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract. Putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the Gal-6 gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the Gal-6 gene. In colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli. Treatment with 16 mug/ml synthetic Gal-6 resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in Clostridium perfringens survival within 60 min, indicating fast killing kinetics. Transmission electron microscopy examination of synthetic-Gal-6-treated Clostridium perfringens cells showed dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells, and cell lysis. The high expression in the proximal digestive tract and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 plays an important role in chicken innate host defense.
TI  - Microbiological baseline study of broiler chickens at Swedish slaughterhouses.
AB  - This 1-year study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and concentrations of  pathogenic and indicator bacteria on Swedish broiler chickens. A total of 636 chilled carcasses were collected from 10 slaughterhouses and sent to the National Food Administration for analyses of carcass rinses. No carcasses were positive for Salmonella. Campylobacter, predominantly Campylobacter jejuni, were detected on 15% (by enrichment) or 14% (by direct plating) of the carcasses. With one exception, all samples from late December through April were Campylobacter negative. The 10th and 90th percentiles of Campylobacter numbers per carcasses were 3.0 and 5.0 log CFU, respectively, and the maximum was 7.1 log CFU. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected on 68% of the carcasses, with a maximum of 3.5 log CFU/cm2. The 10th and 90th percentiles were 3.4 and 4.4 log CFU/cm2 for total aerobic microorganisms, 1.8 and 3.3 log CFU/cm2 for Enterobacteriaceae, and 2.0 and 3.6 log CFU/cm2 for Escherichia coli. No correlation was found between numbers of any indicator bacteria and numbers of pathogenic bacteria. Subsets of the samples were analyzed for Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica, and Enterococcus, resulting in prevalence estimates of 29, 18, 9 (as determined by a PCR assay), and 97%, respectively. L. monocytogenes was most common at slaughterhouses with a low prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, and vice versa. These results will improve the ability of researchers to assess the importance of chicken as a source of foodborne pathogens and can serve as a basis for risk management actions.
TI  - Antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide inhibits the pyruvate oxidoreductases of Helicobacter pylori, selected anaerobic bacteria and parasites, and Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Nitazoxanide (NTZ) exhibits broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic bacteria and parasites and the ulcer-causing pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Here we show that NTZ is a noncompetitive inhibitor (K(i), 2 to 10 microM) of the pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductases (PFORs) of Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, H. pylori, and Campylobacter jejuni and is weakly active against the pyruvate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli. To further mechanistic studies, the PFOR operon of H. pylori was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli, and the multisubunit complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Pyruvate-dependent PFOR activity with NTZ, as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 418 nm (spectral shift from 418 to 351 nm), unlike the reduction of viologen dyes, did not result in the accumulation of products (acetyl coenzyme A and CO(2)) and pyruvate was not consumed in the reaction. NTZ did not displace the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) cofactor of PFOR, and the 351-nm absorbing form of NTZ was inactive. Optical scans and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses determined that the spectral shift (A(418) to A(351)) of NTZ was due to protonation of the anion (NTZ(-)) of the 2-amino group of the thiazole ring which could be generated with the pure compound under acidic solutions (pK(a) = 6.18). We propose that NTZ(-) intercepts PFOR at an early step in the formation of the lactyl-TPP transition intermediate, resulting in the reversal of pyruvate binding prior to decarboxylation and in coordination with proton transfer to NTZ. Thus, NTZ might be the first example of an antimicrobial that targets the "activated cofactor" of an enzymatic reaction rather than its substrate or catalytic sites, a novel mechanism that may escape mutation-based drug resistance.
TI  - [A study to assess the microbial contamination of Mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the St Lawrence River estuary, (Quebec, Canada)].
AB  - The aims of the present study were to assess the microbial quality of Mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the St. Lawrence River estuary and to validate various microbial indicator microorganisms of bivalve mollusks contamination. Clams were collected from nine sites, including four harvesting sites closed by virtue of the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP). Six contamination indicators (fecal coliforms, somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, fecal streptococci, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli) and four pathogens (Campylobacter sp., Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia sp., and Salmonella sp.) were identified in the clams. Indicators sensibility, specificity and predictive values with respect to the presence of pathogens were calculated. Pathogenic microorganisms detection frequency in clams was important (92%). Globally, pathogens tend to be less frequently detected in opened harvesting sites (p = 0.086). Although the assessed indicators were not perfect, when F-specific coliphages are associated with E. coli or fecal coliforms, a good sensibility (62%-64%) and good positive predictive value (88%) with respect to the investigated pathogens are obtained.
TI  - Use of a combination of brushing technique and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method as a novel, rapid, and safe system for detection of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Gastric mucosal biopsy is widely used in the detection of Helicobacter pylori but is associated with a number of problems, including false-negative results due to sampling error and massive bleeding after biopsy. Given the extended period required to culture H. pylori, detection would be further improved by the use of rapid detection methods such as PCR. Here, we developed a rapid, safe, and convenient method for collecting H. pylori which combines endoscopic brushing with the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. The specificity and sensitivity of LAMP were examined using nine urease-generating non-H. pylori bacterial species, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter hepaticus, and 51 H. pylori strains. Results showed that H. pylori-specific LAMP primers amplified H. pylori DNA only and that the lowest detection limit of the LAMP reaction was 10(2) CFU. Brushing and biopsy samples taken from 200 patients with peptic ulcer at Nagoya University Hospital and a regional health care center were subjected to both LAMP and culturing. No adverse effects such as severe bleeding or penetration occurred during the procedure. By LAMP assay, 123 patients were confirmed as H. pylori positive when brushing technique samples were assayed, whereas only 100 were positive when biopsy samples were assayed. Culture assay detected H. pylori in 117 patients when it was combined with the brushing technique and in 96 when it was combined with biopsy. Combination of the endoscopic brushing technique with LAMP is considered a useful and safe system for identifying H. pylori infection.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens, and Plesiomonas shigelloides in marine and freshwater invertebrates from coastal California ecosystems.
AB  - The coastal ecosystems of California are highly utilized by humans and animals, but the ecology of fecal bacteria at the land-sea interface is not well understood. This study evaluated the distribution of potentially pathogenic bacteria in invertebrates from linked marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems in central California. A variety of filter-feeding clams, mussels, worms, and crab tissues were selectively cultured for Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli-O157, Clostridium perfringens, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Vibrio spp. A longitudinal study assessed environmental risk factors for detecting these bacterial species in sentinel mussel batches. Putative risk factors included mussel collection near higher risk areas for livestock or human sewage exposure, adjacent human population density, season, recent precipitation, water temperature, water type, bivalve type, and freshwater outflow exposure. Bacteria detected in invertebrates included Salmonella spp., C. perfringens, P. shigelloides, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus. Overall, 80% of mussel batches were culture positive for at least one of the bacterial species, although the pathogens Campylobacter, E. coli-O157, and Salmonella were not detected. Many of the same bacterial species were also cultured from upstream estuarine and riverine invertebrates. Exposure to human sewage sources, recent precipitation, and water temperature were significant risk factors for bacterial detection in sentinel mussel batches. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that filter-feeding invertebrates along the coast concentrate fecal bacteria flowing from land to sea and show that the relationships between anthropogenic effects on coastal ecosystems and the environmental niches of fecal bacteria are complex and dynamic.
TI  - [Symptoms of food-borne diseases and gastroenteritis in Kyushu, Japan].
AB  - In this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: Norovirus, Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shigella sonnei/flexneri (Shigella), Staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type Bacillus cereus. The symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of Kyushu between January 2000 and December 2004 were recorded. The pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was B. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by S. aureus (3.3 h), C. perfringens (10.7 h) and V. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). All the patients infected with B. cereus and S. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. Bloody diarrhea was associated with STEC and Shigella, but rare with other pathogens. Vomiting was associated with almost all cases of S. aureus and B. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the Norovirus cases and 56.1% of the V. parahaemolyticus cases. Vomiting was less common in the C. perfringens (22.0%) and the ETEC and STEC (both about 5%). Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with STEC 0157 infection than with STEC non-0157 infection. Since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.
TI  - [Study of real-time PCR assays for rapid detection of food-borne pathogens].
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit was evaluated for detection of 8 of 19 species of food-borne pathogens, including Plesiomonas shigelloides, Providencia alcalifaciens, in five stool specimens. The time frame was within 2h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 22 pairs of specific primers. The rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes were determined by this LC-PCR assay from 10 cases of food-borne outbreaks in Shimane Prefecture from 2002 to 2005. These cases included Campylobacter jejuni (4), Clostridium perfringens (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and astA positive E. coli (1), and astA positive E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli 026, and Bacillus cereus (1 each). Rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of food-or water-borne pathogenic bacteria in fecal samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food-borne outbreaks.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of Bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against Clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. One of the bacteria isolated, a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the C. perfringens ATCC 13124 used in this study. The anticlostridial factor produced by B. subtilis PB6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. In contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees C or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. The optimum growth temperature and optimum pH for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees C and 6.20, respectively. Using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the range from 960 to 983 Da. In terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of C. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  - The coordination of food sampling activities across Wales, a part of the United Kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. This surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. The food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. For all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for Escherichia coli, and 0.5% for Listeria spp. Overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. No Campylobacter-positive samples and only one Salmonella-positive sample were found. The analysis of the results show that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current United Kingdom guidelines. The information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of commercial canine and feline raw diets.
AB  - Twenty-five commercial raw diets for dogs and cats were evaluated bacteriologically. Coliforms were present in all diets, ranging from 3.5 x 10(3) to 9.4 x 10(6) CFU/g (mean 8.9 x 10(5); standard deviation 1.9 x 10(6)). Escherichia coli was identified in 15/25 (64%) diets; however, E. coli O157 was not detected. Salmonella spp. were detected in 5/25 (20%) diets; 1 each of beef-, lamb-, quail-, chicken-, and ostrich-based diets. Sporeforming bacteria were identified from 4/25 (16%) samples on direct culture and 25/25 (100%) samples using enrichment culture. Clostridium perfringens was identified in 5/25 (20%) samples. A toxigenic strain of C. difficile was isolated from one turkey-based food. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 1/25 (4%) diets. Campylobacter spp. were not isolated from any of the diets.
TI  - Detection of viral, bacterial, and parasitological RNA or DNA of nine intestinal  pathogens in fecal samples archived as part of the english infectious intestinal disease study: assessment of the stability of target nucleic acid.
AB  - Fecal samples were collected from cases and controls as part of the Infectious Intestinal Disease (IID) study in England and were stored as frozen suspensions for 8 to 12 years. The purpose of this study was to apply PCR-based procedures to assess the stability of pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences present in this archive. Samples from which Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Salmonella, Campylobacter, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC), enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, rotaviruses, noroviruses, or sapoviruses had been previously detected during the IID study using conventional methods were selected from the archive. A generic nucleic acid extraction method to recover RNA or DNA was used. Complementary DNA was generated from RNA by reverse transcription with random priming. Block-based and real-time PCR assays were used to amplify and detect gene fragments from each of these pathogens. The percentage reconfirmation of target was as follows: Giardia duodenalis 68%, Cryptosporidium 96%, Campylobacter 98%, Salmonella 98%, enterotoxigenic C perfringens 34%, EAggEC 93.3%, rotavirus 95%, norovirus 73%, and sapovirus 85%. This study has shown that nucleic acid can be extracted and specific sequences amplified and detected from archived fecal samples. The IID archive therefore represents a valuable resource for further studies, especially the investigation of the samples from which no pathogens had previously been detected.
TI  - One-year (2003) nationwide pork carcass microbiological baseline data survey in Taiwan.
AB  - From January through December 2003, swab samples from 1,650 pork carcasses were collected from 39 slaughter plants in Taiwan. These samples were analyzed for the prevalence of indicator microorganisms and specific pathogens. Viable aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli were recovered from 100, 95.3, and 87.5% of these carcasses, respectively. Of those carcasses that harbored bacteria, the mean aerobic plate, total coliform, and Escherichia coli counts were 4.0, 0.6, and 0.1 log CFU/cm2, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella were recovered from 4.8, 0.3, 13.8, 0.7, and 1.7 of 1,038 carcasses, respectively. E. coli O157:H7 was not detected from any carcass. When positive for a specific pathogen, the mean carcass concentration was 0.57 log CFU/cm2 for S. aureus, 0.66 most probable number (MPN)/cm2 for C. jejuni and C. coli, and 0.18 MPN/cm2 for Salmonella. The findings of this study will help provide a reference for establishing hygienic standards and a criterion for evaluating the effects of slaughtering operations in Taiwan.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of essential oils from Thai medicinal plants.
AB  - By using disc diffusion assay, the antimicrobial activity of 32 essential oil samples extracted from local plants or plants cultivated in Thailand was evaluated against zoonotic enteropathogens including Salmonella spp., Escherichai coli O157, Campylobacter jejunii and Clostridium perferingens which are important for broiler export. Out of the essential oil tested, only the essential oil of Zingiber cassumuna, Cinnamomum bejolghota, Mentha arvensis var. piperacens, Cymbopogon citratus and Ocimum basilicum var. citratum showed promising antibacterial activity against the bacteria tested.
TI  - Ligand binding properties of bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins.
AB  - Bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins share a common globin fold but differ  otherwise in structural and functional aspects. The bases of these differences were investigated through kinetic studies on oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide binding. The novel bacterial hemoglobins from Clostridium perfringens and Campylobacter jejuni and the flavohemoglobins from Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi have been analyzed. Examination of the biochemical and ligand binding properties of these proteins shows a clear distinction between the two groups. Flavohemoglobins show a much greater tendency to autoxidation compared to bacterial hemoglobins. The differences in affinity for oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide between bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins are mainly due to differences in the association rate constants. The second-order rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to bacterial hemoglobins are severalfold higher than those for flavohemoglobins. A similar trend is observed for NO association with the oxidized iron(III) form of the proteins. No major differences are observed among the values obtained for the dissociation rate constants for the two groups of bacterial proteins studied, and these constants are all rather similar to those for myoglobin. Taken together, our data suggest that differences exist between the mechanisms of ligand binding to bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins, suggesting different functions in the cell.
TI  - Application of molecular genetic methods in diagnostics and epidemiology of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter and Yersinia species, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens are the bacterial pathogens constituting the greatest burden of food-borne disease in Finland. Several molecular genetic methods have been applied to diagnose, discriminate and survey these bacteria. PCR, PCR-RFLP and PFGE are the most widely and successfully used. However, these methods are unable to replace conventional and internationally standardised phenotyping. Electronic database libraries of the different genomic profiles will enable continuous surveillance of infections and detection of possible infection clusters at an early stage. Furthermore, whole-genome sequence data have opened up new insights into epidemiological surveillance. Laboratory-based surveillance performed in a timely manner and exploiting adequate methods, and co-operation at local, national and international levels are among the key elements in preventing food-borne diseases. This paper reviews different applications of molecular genetic methods for investigating enteric bacterial pathogens and gives examples of the methods successfully used in diagnostics and epidemiological studies in Finland.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Blinded application of microscopy, bacteriological culture, immunoassays and PCR  to detect gastrointestinal pathogens from faecal samples of patients with community-acquired diarrhoea.
AB  - A blinded trial in two different laboratories was performed to compare the detection of selected enteric pathogens in 92 unselected faecal samples collected from patients with community-acquired diarrhoea by conventional and PCR-based techniques. Conventional techniques detected a single potential etiological agent in 15% of the samples, whereas results of PCR detected evidence of at least one agent in 41% of the samples. Overall, the detection rates for the different pathogens were as follows: adenovirus serogroup F, 1%; Campylobacter spp., 7.6%; Salmonella spp., 4%; enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, 9.8%; enteropathogenic E. coli, 6.5%; enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 3%; Cryptosporidium spp., 13%; and Giardia spp., 11%. Results for the detection of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and C. perfringens were similar by both techniques, whereas Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. were detected 22 times more often by PCR than by conventional microscopy. It was not possible to compare the results for detection of enteroaggregative E. coli and enteropathogenic E. coli since these were only investigated by PCR. The results of this small study clearly demonstrate the advantages of PCR-based methods compared to conventional techniques for the detection of gastrointestinal pathogens.
TI  - Survey of peafowl (Pavo cristatus) for potential pathogens at three Michigan zoos.
AB  - Blood samples collected from 31 free-roaming peafowl from three zoos in Michigan  were tested serologically. Antibody titers were present against avian adenovirus and Bordetella avium in 19.3% and 61.3% of the samples, respectively. Serum plate agglutination tests were positive for Mycoplasma meleagridis and Mycoplasma synoviae in 3.2% and 38.7% of the samples, respectively. All birds were seronegative for avian influenza, Newcastle disease virus, West Nile virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella typhimurium, and Giardia sp. No parasites were seen in blood smears. Cloacal swabs were cultured for anaerobic, aerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria. Clostridium perfringens type A and Escherichia coli were cultured most frequently from 64.5% and 29% of the samples, respectively, whereas Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were not isolated. Fecal samples contained moderate numbers of ascarid and Capillaria sp. ova and coccidian oocysts. Female biting lice (Goniodes gigas) were identified on three birds.
TI  - Campylobacter spp., Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., noroviruses, and indicator organisms in surface water in southwestern Finland, 2000-2001.
AB  - A total of 139 surface water samples from seven lakes and 15 rivers in southwestern Finland were analyzed during five consecutive seasons from autumn 2000 to autumn 2001 for the presence of various enteropathogens (Campylobacter spp., Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and noroviruses) and fecal indicators (thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and F-RNA bacteriophages) and for physicochemical parameters (turbidity and temperature); this was the first such systematic study. Altogether, 41.0% (57 of 139) of the samples were positive for at least one of the pathogens; 17.3% were positive for Campylobacter spp. (45.8% of the positive samples contained Campylobacter jejuni, 25.0% contained Campylobacter lari, 4.2% contained Campylobacter coli, and 25.0% contained Campylobacter isolates that were not identified), 13.7% were positive for Giardia spp., 10.1% were positive for Cryptosporidium spp., and 9.4% were positive for noroviruses (23.0% of the positive samples contained genogroup I and 77.0% contained genogroup II). The samples were positive for enteropathogens significantly (P < 0.05) less frequently during the winter season than during the other sampling seasons. No significant differences in the prevalence of enteropathogens were found when rivers and lakes were compared. The presence of thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli, and C. perfringens had significant bivariate nonparametric Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients (P < 0.001) with samples that were positive for one or more of the pathogens analyzed. The absence of these indicators in a logistic regression model was found to have significant predictive value (odds ratios, 1.15 x 10(8), 7.57, and 2.74, respectively; P < 0.05) for a sample that was negative for the pathogens analyzed. There were no significant correlations between counts or count levels for thermotolerant coliforms or E. coli or the presence of F-RNA phages and pathogens in the samples analyzed.
TI  - Duplex real-time SYBR green PCR assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (T(m)) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. No interference with the LC-PCR assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. The detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool. The protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. However, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  - To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.
TI  - Bacterial-associated diarrhea in the dog: a critical appraisal.
AB  - The clinical documentation of enteropathogenic bacteria causing diarrhea in dogs  is clouded by the presence of many of these organisms existing as normal constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora. The diagnosis of a putative bacterial enteropathogen(s) in dogs should be made based on a combination of parameters, including signalment and predisposing factors, clinical signs, serologic assays for toxins, fecal culture, and PCR. Relying on results of fecal culture alone is problematic, because C perfringens, C difficile, Campylobacter spp, and pathogenic and non-pathogenic E coli are commonly isolated from apparently healthy dogs [10,13,33]. Nevertheless, culture may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques, such as PCR, for detection of specific toxin genes or molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks. The oversimplistic attempt to characterize bacterially associated diarrhea by anatomic localization of clinical signs should be discouraged, because most of the previously mentioned bacteria have been associated with small and large intestinal diarrhea. Accurate diagnosis of infections may require diagnostic laboratories to incorporate PCR-based assays using genus- and species-specific primers to facilitate detection of toxin genes and differentiation of species that appear phenotypically and biochemically similar. There has been tremendous interest in the application of microarray technology for the simultaneous detection of thousands of genes or target DNA sequences on one glass slide. This powerful tool could be used for detection of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in fecal specimens obtained from dogs in the future.
TI  - Trends in indigenous foodborne disease and deaths, England and Wales: 1992 to 2000.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Commitment to food safety is evidenced by high profile governmental initiatives around the globe. To measure progress towards targets, policy makers need to know the baseline from which they started. AIM: To describe the burden (mortality, morbidity, new presentations to general practice, hospital admissions, and hospital occupancy) and trends of indigenous foodborne disease (IFD) in England and Wales between 1992 and 2000. METHODS: Routinely available surveillance data, special survey data, and hospital episode statistics were collated and arithmetic employed to estimate the burden and trends of IFD in England and Wales. Adjustments were made for underascertainment of disease through national surveillance and for foreign travel. The final estimates were compared with those from the USA. RESULTS: In 1995 there were an estimated 2,365,909 cases, 21,138 hospital admissions, and 718 deaths in England and Wales due to IFD. By 2000 this had fallen to 1,338,772 cases, 20,759 hospital admissions, and 480 deaths. In terms of disease burden the most important pathogens were campylobacters, salmonellas, Clostridium perfringens, verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157, and Listeria monocytogenes. The ratio of food related illness in the USA to IFD in England and Wales in 2000 was 57:1. Taking into account population rates, this ratio fell to 11:1 and converged when aetiology and disease severity were considered. CONCLUSION: Reducing IFD in England and Wales means tackling campylobacter. Lowering mortality rates however also requires better control and prevention of salmonellas, Cl perfringens, L monocytogenes, and VTEC O157.

TI  - Microbiological status of commercially available medicinal herbal drugs--a screening study.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-eight medicinal herbal drugs obtained from different suppliers were examined for microbial contaminants and for the detectability of pathogenic microorganisms. For this purpose, several microbiological standard parameters (total aerobic mesophilic count, enterobacteria, coliforms, aerobic sporeformers, yeasts and moulds, enterococci, lactobacilli, pseudomonades and aeromades) and selective methods for the detection of indicator microorganisms and pathogens (E. coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Candida albicans, potentially aflatoxigenic moulds) were applied. The microbial load of the samples varied considerably. While none of the samples contained EHEC, Salmonellae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeriae, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, four samples were E. coli positive, two samples were presumptively Campylobacter jejuni positive and nine herbal drugs contained a potentially aflatoxigenic mould flora. Further details regarding different viable count classes as well as preparation techniques are discussed.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - A survey of ethnic foods for microbial quality and aflatoxin content.
AB  - A range of ethnic foods was examined for their microbiological content in relation to total viable counts (TVC) of aerobic bacteria, counts of presumptive coliforms, yeast and mould counts; presence of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter spp.; total enumeration of Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus spp.; identification of moulds and the presence of total aflatoxins. Samples, which included cereals, nuts, dried fruits, herbs and spices, were obtained from local retail outlets and distributors. It was established that three samples of pistachio nuts contained significant levels of aflatoxins. The concentration of total aflatoxins in these three nut samples ranged from 15 to 259 microg/kg of sample. Only two other samples contained trace amounts of aflatoxins, all other samples analysed were found to be free of any detectable level of aflatoxins. TVCs, coliform counts and yeast and mould counts varied widely depending on the matrix tested. Generally, rice, wheat and peanuts produced low counts whereas other nuts, gram flour and spices produced much higher counts. Cl. perfringens, Staph. aureus, and Bacillus spp. were common in spices, nuts and gram flour, however, Listeria monocytogenes was only detected in four samples and in no sample could Salmonella spp, E. coli O157:H7 or Campylobacter spp. be detected.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of milk lipids.
AB  - The bactericidal capacity of digestion products of bovine milk triglycerides and  membrane lipids was tested in vitro using Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Clostridium perfringens. C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acids and digestion products of sphingolipids appeared to be effective bactericidal agents, whereas digestion products of phosphoglycerides were moderately bactericidal. Thus, milk fat sphingolipids and triglycerides, particularly those containing C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acids, may protect against food-borne gastroenteritis.
TI  - Spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  - This short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. As a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. Molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. For example, for Salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of S. typhimurium DT104 in 1998. The high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. The resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.
TI  - Microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. For each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. Dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform counts and spore counts. Six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. The incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was also determined. In most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. In addition, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. Mean bacterial counts of water and swab samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.The predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Alcaligenes spp. Bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, Clostridium perfringens in 1%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3% and Vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were not detected. Non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - Fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Food temperatures were recorded at the time of sampling. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (APCs), spore counts (SCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (CCs) for water and swab samples. In addition, Petrifilm Escherichia coli count (PC) plates were used for the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. The presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic E. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. Predominant colonies isolated from APC plates were characterized to the genus level. Holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees C. Mean APC values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log CFU/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Mean SC values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log CFU/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. A mean EC value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g for food samples and mean CC values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/ml and 1.3 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. Mean PC values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log CFU/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log CFU/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, Clostridium perfringens in 16%, Salmonella spp. in 2%, and E. coli (non-O157:H+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. E. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. The 340 isolates obtained from APC plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. It was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with a sorghum-based fermented weaning cereal.
AB  - Microbiological surveys, to determine the quality and safety, were conducted on 45 sorghum samples comprising dry powders (n = 15) and corresponding fermented (n = 15) and cooked fermented porridge (n = 15) samples collected from households in an informal settlement of the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Mean aerobic plate counts, Gram-negative counts and bacterial spore counts of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge samples. However, mean lactic acid bacteria counts increased in fermented porridge samples, but decreased slightly in cooked fermented porridge samples. The mean pH value of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge, respectively. Bacillus (B.) cereus was detected in all 15 sorghum powder samples, while Escherichia (E.) coli was detected in 53%, Clostridium perfringens in 27%, Listeria monocytogenes in 13% and Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp., each in 7% of sorghum powder samples. Of the fermented porridge samples, 40% contained B. cereus and 7% contained E. coli. None of the pathogens tested for were detected in cooked fermented porridge samples. B. cereus (53%), B. subtilis (21%), B. thuringiensis (13%), B. licheniformis (10%) and B. coagulans (3%) were identified from 120 isolates randomly selected from spore count plates of the highest dilution showing growth.
TI  - Foodborne illness in the elderly.
AB  - The elderly (> or = 65 years of age) are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from foodborne-induced gastroenteritis than younger individuals. Several factors contribute to the increased susceptibility to foodborne infections as well as other infections in elderly populations. These include an age-associated decrease in humoral and cellular immunity, age-related changes in the gastrointestinal tract (decreased production of gastric acid and decreased intestinal motility), malnutrition, lack of exercise, entry into nursing homes, and excessive use of antibiotics. Data from foodborne outbreaks associated with nursing homes indicate that the elderly are more likely to die from foodborne Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus infections than the general population. Infections by Salmonella species are the most common cause of illness and death in nursing homes with Salmonella enteritidis as the major cause of both morbidity and mortality. While it is impossible to turn back the clock, practicing a healthy life-style with regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, receiving regular health care, paying attention to personal hygiene, and monitoring food preparation and handling should lead to a reduced incidence of foodborne and other infections in the elderly.
TI  - Public health hazards from small ruminant meat products in Europe.
AB  - Foodborne diseases, in particular those related to meat and meat products, have recently become a matter of great public concern. Sheep and goat meat can transmit infections and diseases either through handling during preparation procedures or as a result of ingestion by the consumer. The authors highlight the second route of contamination in relation to meat and meat products from small ruminants in European countries. Among the most important diseases transmitted by mutton and goat meat, toxoplasmosis remains the greatest threat, particularly in immuno-compromised people and in pregnant women. Other pathogens which may be associated with the consumption of meat from small ruminants include: Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum and Campylobacter jejuni. As with other ruminant species, Escherichia coli O157:H7 can be considered as an emerging pathogen, for which control efforts must be made. The classical zoonoses (brucellosis, Q fever, hydatidosis) are also presented here, although the major source of contamination for these diseases remains contact with infected animals or the handling of carcasses. The fact that the association of foodborne diseases with mutton and goat meat is less frequent than with the meat of other animal species should be noted, for the following reasons: a) lower levels of production; b) less intensive production, leading to a weaker microbial contamination; c) mutton and goat meat are subjected to processing less often than other meats; d) the usual boiling or cooking processes.
TI  - Meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  - The authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the United States of America (USA) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. Cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the USA, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. The potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include Salmonella (with special attention to S. Typhimurium DT104), Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas spp. In conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.
TI  - Microbiological composition of raw milk from selected farms in the Camembert region of Normandy.
AB  - Raw milk from 27 farms was sampled over 6 months for listerias, salmonellas, Yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacters. Total bacterial counts and somatic cell counts were measured. Lactococci, lactobacilli, dextran-producing leuconostocs, Brevibacterium linens, yeasts and moulds, Staphylococcus aureus and other Micrococcaceae, Pseudomonas, coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and spores of anaerobic lactate-fermenting bacteria were also counted. Pseudomonas (2000 cfu ml-1), lactococci (760 cfu ml-1) and Micrococcaceae (720 cfu ml-1) were the most numerous groups. Lactic acid bacteria were detected in all samples. Coliforms were present in most samples, but 84% of samples had counts < 100 cfu ml-1. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 62% of milks, the average count was 410 cfu ml-1. About 80% of supplies had < or = 10 E. coli cfu ml-1 and all samples had < or = 1 Cl. perfringens cfu ml-1. Two of the tested milks were positive for salmonellas (2.9%), four were positive for Listeria monocytogenes (5.8%), 25 for Yersinia enterocolitica (36%) and one for campylobacters (1.4%).
TI  - Economic costs and trade impacts of microbial foodborne illness.
AB  - This article presents the economic costs of foodborne diseases for selected countries, the approaches used to calculate these costs, and a discussion on the interaction between microbial food safety issues and international trade in food. The human illness costs due to foodborne pathogens are estimated most completely in the United States of America, where, each year, 7 foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Toxoplasma gondii) cause an estimated 3.3-12.3 million cases of foodborne illness and up to 3900 deaths. These 7 pathogens are found in animal products and cost the United States an estimated $6.5-$34.9 billion (1995 US$) annually. The presence of foodborne pathogens in a country's food supply not only affects the health of the local population, but also represents a potential for spread to pathogens to visitors to the country and to consumers in countries which import food products. With more complete data on foodborne illnesses, deaths, costs and international trade rejections in each country, indicators could be developed by which changes in food safety can be monitored.
TI  - Safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  - The revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. Due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. Epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. The organisms involved are Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens and Aeromonas spp. Contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level. In terms of the critical control point approach of the HACCP concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. To guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - Foal diarrhoea between 1991 and 1994 in the United Kingdom associated with Clostridium perfringens, rotavirus, Strongyloides westeri and Cryptosporidium spp.
AB  - A case control study of foal diarrhoea in the United Kingdom was carried out over a 3-year period. Clostridium perfringens was significantly associated with foal diarrhoea (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.0), being isolated from 57% of 421 animals with diarrhoea but from only 27% of 223 healthy foals. Also, C. perfringens was significantly associated with fatal diarrhoea (OR = 4.5). About half of diarrhoea with a fatal outcome was attributable to this organism. The other pathogens significantly associated with diarrhoea were rotavirus (OR = 5.6), Cryptosporidium spp. (OR = 3.2) and the nematode Strongyloides westeri, which was significant only when present in large numbers (> 2000 eggs/g of faeces: OR = 6.1). Salmonella spp. (OR = 14.2) and Cryptosporidium spp. (OR = 3.0) were the only other pathogens associated with fatal illness. Overall, C. perfringens, rotavirus, and large numbers of Cryptosporidium spp. or S. westeri were isolated from 80% of foals with diarrhoea. Thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli and other parasites were not associated with diarrhoea. Carriage of C. perfringens, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. was significantly greater in healthy foals in contact with cases of diarrhoea than in foals that were not in contact with diarrhoea (P < 0.05). There were no statistical interactions between any of the pathogens associated with diarrhoea although separate cases from one location often involved more than one pathogen.
TI  - Probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - DNA-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. In this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of Salmonella, E. coli, V. cholerae, non-O1 Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and C. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. In food control, DNA-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of DNA-based methods. The most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.
TI  - Regulatory effects of bifidobacteria on the growth of other colonic bacteria.
AB  - In the human large intestine bifidobacteria are a numerically important group of  micro-organisms which are considered to exert a range of biological activities related to host health. One aspect is the inhibitory effect of these bacteria on other species, possibly excluding long term colonization by invasive pathogens. It has been suggested that the mechanism of inhibition carried out by bifidobacteria is related to the fermentative production of acids such as acetate and lactate. Experiments reported in this paper attempted to address this theory. Co-culture experiments whereby Bifidobacterium infantis was incubated with Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, in a variety of fermentation systems, indicated that the bifidobacterium was able to exert an inhibitory effect not necessarily related to acid production. Further studies showed that eight species of bifidobacteria could variously excrete an anti-microbial substance with a broad spectrum of activity. Species belonging to the genera Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter and Shigella, as well as Vibrio cholerae, were all affected. These results show that bifidobacteria are able to exert more than one mechanism of inhibition, which may be of some importance with regard to protection against gastroenteritis.
TI  - Two-year study of endemic enteric pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in New Caledonia.
AB  - A longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in New Caledonia from January 1990 to December 1991. Stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. Potential sources of contamination (drinking water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. One or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., HEp-2 cell adherent Escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (EPEC adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent E. coli (non-EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. Other major enteropathogens were Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. No Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Shiga-like-toxin-producing E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, or enteroinvasive E. coli were identified. Shiga-like toxin I-producing E. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin II-producing enterotoxigenic E. coli were found in pigs.
TI  - Application of polymerase chain reaction for the correlation of Salmonella serovars recovered from greyhound feces with their diet.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction was employed to correlate Salmonella serovars isolated from fecal material of greyhounds suffering from gastroenteritis with those isolated from the diet fed to the greyhounds prior to onset of diarrhea. Kennels around the Abilene, Kansas, area were contacted and supplied with materials needed to collect a portion of the diet each day. With the onset of diarrhea, the kennels were instructed to ship the fecal material and diet from the previous 10 days to the laboratory for testing. Forty-one fecal samples and corresponding diets were screened for Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, and pathogenic (piliated) Escherichia coli by direct culture using standard procedures. The fecal material was also screened for coronavirus and parvovirus using electron microscopy. Thirty-five "normal" fecal samples were screened for all of the above mentioned microorganisms as a control. In addition, the fecal material was screened for E. coli verotoxins I and II and clostridial enterotoxins. A total of 61 Salmonella isolates were recovered from the 41 samples of feces and diet submitted for testing; 31 were recovered from the feces and 30 from the diet. Four Salmonella isolates were recovered from the normal fecal samples. Results obtained by PCR, plasmid profiles, antigenic analysis, and antibiogram profiles indicated that 16 of the 31 isolates recovered from the fecal material were the same strain as that recovered from the diet.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - A study of the bacterial and parasitic causes of acute diarrhoea in northern Jordan.
AB  - The prevalence of bacterial and parasitic diarrhoeagenic agents in 200 patients suffering from acute diarrhoea and reporting to hospitals and health centres in northern Jordan, and in controls was determined. One or more bacterial or parasitic enteropathogens was isolated from 79 patients (39.5%). Prevalence rates for these pathogens was as follows: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, 9%; enteropathogenic E. coli, 9%; Salmonella spp. 7%; Campylobacter spp, 5.5%; Yersinia enterocolitica, 4.5%; Shigella spp, 4%; Aeromonas spp, 3.5%; enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 2%; Vibrio spp, 2%; and Plesiomonas shigelloides, 0.5%. Both Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica were detected in 2% of the stool samples examined. Although the determination of the aetiologic role of the identified enteropathogens was complicated by more than one factor, the data collected will serve as a baseline for future studies of the subject.
TI  - The prevalence of enteric pathogens in diarrhoeic thoroughbred foals in Britain and Ireland.
AB  - A survey of 77 normal and 326 diarrhoeic foals in Britain and Ireland from 1987 to 1989 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of Group A rotaviruses and Aeromonas hydrophila in diarrhoeic foals. The prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Clostridium perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. Rotaviruses had a similar prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. The number of cases of diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. A comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to have similar sensitivity. The Rotazyme ELISA test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of EM and PAGE. A. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. A. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. Other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. No evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic E. coli. Neither coccidia nor non-Group A rotaviruses were found in any of the samples examined.
TI  - Relationship between the Clostridium perfringens catQ gene product and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases from other bacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium perfringens chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-encoding resistance determinant, catQ, was determined. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 219 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,014 was identified. Although catQ was expressed constitutively, sequences similar in structure to those found upstream of inducible cat genes were observed. The catQ gene was distinct from the C. perfringens catP determinant. The deduced CATQ monomer had considerable amino acid sequence conservation compared with CATP (53% similarity) and other known CAT proteins (39 to 53%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CATQ monomer was as closely related to CAT proteins from Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter coli as it was to CAT monomers from the clostridia.
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - [Value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  - Reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Shigella and Salmonella. Intestinal infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata and Schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis. Detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. A large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. It is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. The detection of serum antibodies to Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, C. jejuni/coli, and Schistosoma may suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.

TI  - [Infectious diarrhea in the adult].
AB  - Infectious diarrhoeas are usually divided into two types; toxinogenic and invasive. Invasive diarrhoeas are copious and responsible for dehydration which is the principal clinical sign; mucosal lesions and bacteraemia are absent. The most typical of toxinogenic diarrhoeas is cholera, but enterotoxicogenic E. coli and Aeromonas infections have similar clinical features. In invasive diarrhoeas the responsible microorganisms penetrate into the epithelial cells of the intestine, producing fever and stools that contain blood and mucus. However, some organisms causing invasive diarrhoeas secrete cytotoxins; they include Shigella spp., Salmonella spp, some strains of E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia spp. When diarrhoea occurs in patients under antibiotics pseudomembranous colitis due to the proliferation of Clostridium difficile must be suspected; the diagnosis is suggested by endoscopy and confirmed by bacteriology. Toxic and infectious diarrhoeas due to food are increasingly frequent; they are usually caused by Salmonella spp., but sometimes by Clostridium perfringens or Staphylococcus aureus. In patients with suspected infectious diarrhoea symptomatic treatment combined or not with intestinal antibacterial agents is immediately initiated in most cases; stool cultures are reserved to severe or protracted diarrhoeas. Specimens must be collected under the best conditions and rapidly sent to the laboratory.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - [The "diseased" or "dead" guillemots (Uria aalge), three-toed gulls (Rissa tridactyla), silver gulls (Larus argentatus) and laughing gulls (Larus ridibundus) found in the area of the German Bay, 1982-1985].
AB  - Between 1982 and 1985 the cadavers of 50 Guillemots (Uria aalge), 41 Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), 26 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and 34 Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus) were examined pathological, bacteriological and virological. The probable cause of death was established. Parasitosis were particularly prevalent in Herring Gulls (49%), where the main infection--as in Black-headed Gulls--was with Cestoides. In Kittiwakes and Guillemots mainly Spiruroideae were recorded. The commonest bacterium isolated in organs and intestinal tract was Escherichia coli, followed by Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridium perfringens. Salmonella were found in the organs of 5% and in the intestinal tract of 3% of the birds. The species of Salmonella most frequently isolated was Salmonella typhimurium varieties copenhagen. Also recorded were Yersinia intermedia Serovar 0:17 (1x), Pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria of the Haemophilus-Pasteurella-Actinobacillus group (1x), Pasteurella multocida (2x), Moraxella septicaemiae (1x), Campylobacter spec. (1x), Mycoplasma spec. (6x), DNase positive Staphylococcus spec. (4x) and Streptococcus spec. (6x). Less in evidence among the birds examined were fungus diseases with Aspergillus spec. (4x) and Blastomyces spec. (4x). As for viruses one Guillemot was found to have an Adenovirus and another one to have a Paramyxovirus. From one of the Herring Gulls there also was isolated a Paramyxovirus, from a second one to a Reovirus. Three other species isolated have get to be identified. The chief cause of sickness and death in the Guillemots was oil-contamination. The majority of the examined Kittiwakes and Herring Gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. Many of the Black-headed Gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. In order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. Without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.
TI  - [The occurrence of Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal flora of gray herons (Ardea cinerea)].
AB  - The flora of the large intestine of 92 grey herons was examined for the frequency of aerobic and microaerobic growing bacteria. Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides and E. coli were isolated from 55%, 48%, 14% and 35% of the birds, respectively. It could be demonstrated that the findings of these bacteria in the intestinal flora are depending on the age of the birds. The percentage of carriers of Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas hydrophila and Plesiomonas shigelloides was highest in nestlings younger than 18 days, less high in older nestlings and lowest in adult grey herons. Contrary to those bacteria, E. coli was found more often in the intestinal flora at increasing age of the birds. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 6 birds. Two birds yielded positive for Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp., respectively. Other aerobic and microaerobic bacteria play a less significant role as part of the intestinal flora.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Raw beef, pork and chicken in Japan contaminated with Salmonella sp., Campylobacter sp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Clostridium perfringens--a comparative study.
AB  - One hundred and twenty samples each of raw ground beef, pork and chicken from ten local grocery stores in Shimane Prefecture, Japan, were examined for the presence of Salmonella sp. (Sal), Campylobacter jejuni (Cj), Campylobacter coli (Cc), Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye), and Clostridium perfringens (Cp) from April 1984 to March 1985. A total of 205 isolates of Sal (112 strains), Cj (64 strains), Cc (one strain), Ye (7 strains) and Cp (21 strains) were recovered from 17 beef (14.2%), 31 pork (25.8%) and 94 chicken (78.3%) of 120 samples each. Sal biogroup 1 was found in 8.3% of beef, 13.3% of pork and 35.0% of chicken, Sal biogroup 2 in 0.8% of beef, 4.2% of pork and 14.2% of chicken, Cj in 1.7% of beef and pork and 50.0% of chicken, Cc in 0.8% of pork, Ye serotype 03 was found in 5.0% of pork, and Cp in 1.7% of beef and pork and 10.8% of chicken. These enteropathogens were recovered concomitantly from two pork and 31 chicken samples, especially Sal and Cj. Sal was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/100 g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(3)/100 g of chicken, Cj was counted at less than or equal to 10(1)/g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of chicken, Ye serotype 03 was counted at less than or equal to 10(3)/g of pork, Cp was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)g of chicken, and Cc from pork and Cp from beef were recovered by using enrichment culture. This investigation showed that a second-contamination of Sal and Cj from chicken to beef and pork frequently occurred during the warm months of the year. It was suggested that chicken may become a source of infection with plural organisms of enteric pathogens, especially Sal and Cj, at the same time all the year round, and that pork may be an important source of infection with Ye during the cold months.
TI  - Bacteria in enteric lesions of horses.
AB  - Thirty-three species of bacteria were isolated from the gastrointestinal mucosa of 23 adult horses and two foals. The bacteria isolated could be related to gross and microscopical lesions in some cases. Clostridium perfringens type A, Actinobacillus equuli, Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter coli biotype 1 could all be associated with gastrointestinal lesions. C jejuni biotype 1 and Aeromonas hydrophila were both recovered in this study and have been identified as causes of enteritis in horses or in other species. The case of C coli enteritis appears to be the first such report. The difficulties in examining adult horses with enteritis and relating the lesions seen to the bacteria isolated are discussed.
TI  - Prevalence of various enteropathogens in the feces of diarrheic and healthy calves.
AB  - The presence of various enteropathogens was examined in the feces of homebred dairy calves reared in a restricted geographical area of France (North West of County of Indre-et-Loire) during winter 1983-1984. Two distinct surveys were carried on: a case-control study including 32 diarrheic calves and 21 healthy calves bred in 53 different farms; and a separate study on nine diarrheic calves in another farm. The following infectious agents were looked for, by specific methods of detection: Escherichia coli K99 and E. coli lethal for mice, Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, Chlamydia psittaci, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, Cryptosporidium. In the case-control survey, no enterotoxigenic E. coli (K99+) was detected in either group of calves. Four agents were more often detected in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves, i.e. rotavirus (12/32 vs 1/21), lethal E. coli (6/32 vs 1/21), Cryptosporidium (2/32 vs 0/21) and Salmonella typhimurium (1/32 vs 0/21). One at least of these four agents was present in 16 diarrheic calves (50%) vs only 2 healthy calves (10%) (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and of C. perfringens, enterotoxin was similar in both groups of calves, accounting respectively for about 20% and 10% of total calves. Moreover, coronavirus-like particles were significatively associated with healthy calves (7/32 vs 11/21; P less than 0.05). In the other study, all the main categories of enteropathogens were detected throughout the period of observation in the same farm with the exception of enterotoxigenic E. coli. But each calf taken individually was rarely shedding more than two agents at a time. In addition, specific antibodies against C. perfringens enterotoxin, as tested in an ELISA test, were present in the serum of all the calves examined in both surveys. This study confirms the primary role of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium as agents of diarrhea in calves under three weeks. It also suggests the possible participation of E. coli strains that are lethal for mice and underlines the potential hazard for human health of bovine reservoirs of Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens.
TI  - [Epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  - Diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. About one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. Many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. Among the viral infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; Norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear to occur worldwide. Enteropathogenic (EPEC) and, especially, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. Shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. Yersinia enterocolitica is rare in tropical countries. Cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (V. cholerae non-01, V. mimicus, V. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. Clostridium perfringens type C is the causal agent of Enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially New Guinea. C. difficile appears to be of minor importance. Among the parasites Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. Macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella and E. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of goat's milk. A Public Health Laboratory Service survey.
AB  - In a 12-month survey (June 1982-May 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. The statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. Surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees C and by 76% at 22 degrees C. There were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 Escherichia coli per ml in 91%. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. Only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. The methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. No sample was Brucella ring-test-positive. Experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored goat's milk showed that Bacillus cereus, Staph. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees C. Clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while Campylobacter jejuni did not grow. The results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.
TI  - [Pathogenesis, clinical aspects and diagnosis of the most important enteric bacterial diseases in animals].
AB  - There are adhesive and invasive species among enteropathogenic bacteria for animals. Most frequently isolated adhesive bacteria are enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Salmonella, T. hyodysenteriae, M. paratuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica, Cl. perfringens and C. jejuni bacteria represent the most important invasive germs. The main clinical finding connected with bacterial enteritis is diarrhoea resp. dysentery. Evaluation of feces consistency, time of appearance and accompanying symptoms (e.g. fever, colic) allow a clinical suspective diagnosis, however a definitive diagnosis must be based on the demonstration of the causative agent. In addition to known cultural, microscopic, biochemical and serological diagnostic methods, the demonstration of virulence factors (enterotoxin formation, adhesive pili) plays an important role in diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
