TI  - The functional vanGCd cluster of Clostridium difficile does not confer vancomycin resistance.
AB  - vanGCd, a cryptic gene cluster highly homologous to the vanG gene cluster of Enterococcus faecalis is largely spread in Clostridium difficile. Since emergence of vancomycin resistance would have dramatic clinical consequences, we have evaluated the capacity of the vanGCd cluster to confer resistance. We showed that expression of vanGCd is inducible by vancomycin and that VanGCd , VanXYCd and VanTCd are functional, exhibiting D-Ala : D-Ser ligase, D,D-dipeptidase and D-Ser racemase activities respectively. In other bacteria, these enzymes are sufficient to promote vancomycin resistance. Trans-complementation of C. difficile with the vanC resistance operon of Enterococcus gallinarum faintly impacted the MIC of vancomycin, but did not promote vancomycin resistance in C. difficile. Sublethal concentration of vancomycin led to production of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide[D-Ser], suggesting that the vanGCd gene cluster is able to modify the peptidoglycan precursors. Our results indicated amidation of UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide[D-Ala] and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide[D-Ser]. This modification is passed on the mature peptidoglycan where a muropeptide Tetra-Tetra is amidated on the meso-diaminopimelic acid. Taken together, our results suggest that the vanGCd gene cluster is functional and is prevented from promoting vancomycin resistance in C. difficile.
TI  - Low prevalence of VRE gastrointestinal colonization of hospitalized patients in Manitoba tertiary care and community hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)  bowel colonization in hospitalized patients in Manitoba who had stool specimens collected for Clostridium difficile toxin and/or culture testing. DESIGN: Two tertiary care and five community hospitals in Winnipeg and three rural Manitoba community hospitals participated in this study. From January 1 to December 31, 1997 stool specimens, one per patient, submitted to hospital microbiology laboratories for C difficile toxin and/or culture testing were screened for VRE on colistin-nalidixic acid-vancomycin (6 microg/mL) (CNAV) agar plates. The study was divided into six, eight-week intervals. Stool specimens received in the first two weeks of each eight week interval were screened for VRE. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1408 stool specimens were submitted over the 48-week study period. Sixty-seven (4.8%) patients with VRE colonization of their lower gastrointestinal tract were identified. Three of the 67 (4.5%) VRE isolates were Enterococcus faecium, with the remaining 64 (95.5%) were Enterococcus gallinarum. The three vancomycin-resistant E faecium -VREF- (from two different Winnipeg hospitals) demonstrated the vanA genotype, and were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and ampicillin. All three VREF isolates also demonstrated high level resistance to both gentamicin and streptomycin but were susceptible to quinuprisitin/dalfopristin and LY333328. CONCLUSION: VRE colonization in hospitalized patients in Manitoba is infrequent and most commonly due to E gallinarum. The prevalence of VREF colonization in the patients studied was 0.2% (three of 1408).
TI  - Clostridium difficile toxins and enterococcal translocation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile toxins alter permeability in cultured enterocytes and may alter intestinal epithelial permeability to bacteria in vivo. Experiments were designed to test the effects of C. difficile toxins on in vitro interactions of Enterococcus gallinarum with cultured enterocytes, as well as on translocation of E. gallinarum in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mature Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes were pretreated with C. difficile toxin A or toxin B followed by incubation with E. gallinarum. E. gallinarum-enterocyte interactions were assessed by quantitative culture. For in vivo experiments, antibiotic-treated mice were orally inoculated with C. difficile or saline, and all mice were orally inoculated 24 h later with E. gallinarum and sacrificed after another 24 h for analysis of cecal bacteria, cecal C. difficile toxin, and enterococcal translocation. Cecal C. difficile toxin was assayed as cytopathic effects on human foreskin fibroblasts. RESULTS: Although neither toxin had a noticeable effect on bacterial internalization by cultured enterocytes, C. difficile toxins were associated with increased E. gallinarum transmigration across confluent enterocyte cultures. Mice orally inoculated with saline rather than C. difficile (n = 29) had no detectable cecal toxin, while mice orally inoculated with C. difficile (n = 30) had detectable cecal toxin. Viable E. gallinarum was recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes of 97% of mice orally inoculated with saline followed by oral E. gallinarum, but only 37% of mice orally inoculated with C. difficile followed by oral E. gallinarum (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that observations with cultured enterocytes, demonstrating that C. difficile toxins facilitated bacterial migration across the intestinal epithelium, might have little in vivo relevance in a mouse model of antibiotic-induced C. difficile overgrowth.
TI  - Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  - AIM: To describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of Enterococcus species in Auckland. BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. It is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. METHODS: Enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group I were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group II were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group III were enterococci from stool specimens sent for Clostridium difficile toxin testing; group IV were isolates from stool specimens submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. All enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 121 group I enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. Enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group II specimens; 166/279 (60%) group III specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group IV specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were E faecalis, 12% E faecium, 6% E gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. No isolate produced beta-lactamase. All E faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. Two E faecium and one enterococcus species were resistant to amoxycillin (MICs all 16 mg/L). All isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. Fourteen E gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (MICs of 8 mg/L). One E faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC 8 mg/L). High level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. CONCLUSION: Vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., E casseliflavus and E gallinarum. Our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. This allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.
