role of d535 and h538 in endogenous toxicity of xenocin from xenorhabdus nematophila.
bacteriocins are the toxic proteins produced by bacteria under stress condition to inhibit the growth of closely related bacterial strain(s). in our earlier study, purified recombinant xenocin-immunity protein complex from xenorhabdus nematophila showed detrimental effect on six different insect gut residing bacteria. in this study, endogenous toxicity assay with xcina and its catalytic domain under tightly regulated ara promoter was performed. multiple sequence alignment and homology modelling revealed six conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic domain of xenocin. site-directed mutagenesis was performed in all the conserved residues, followed growth profile analysis of all the mutants by endogenous toxicity assay. among the six different conserved sites in catalytic domain of xenocin, we have identified one position where mutation resulted in no measurable reduction in the endogenous toxicity (k564), three positions with measurable reduction in the endogenous toxicity (e542, h551 and r570) and two positions where mutation caused a significant reduction in the toxicity (d535 and h538). endogenous toxicity assay is validated by in vitro rna degradation assay. structural integrity of purified recombinant proteins was confirmed through circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. our results indicate that d535 and h538 act as the acid-base pair for rna hydrolysis.
small molecule perimeter defense in entomopathogenic bacteria.
two gram-negative insect pathogens, xenorhabdus nematophila and photorhabdus luminescens, produce rhabduscin, an amidoglycosyl- and vinyl-isonitrile-functionalized tyrosine derivative. heterologous expression of the rhabduscin pathway in escherichia coli, precursor-directed biosynthesis of rhabduscin analogs, biochemical assays, and visualization using both stimulated raman scattering and confocal fluorescence microscopy established rhabduscin's role as a potent nanomolar-level inhibitor of phenoloxidase, a key component of the insect's innate immune system, as well as rhabduscin's localization at the bacterial cell surface. stimulated raman scattering microscopy visualized rhabduscin at the periphery of wild-type x. nematophila cells and e. coli cells heterologously expressing the rhabduscin pathway. precursor-directed biosynthesis created rhabduscin mimics in x. nematophila pathway mutants that could be accessed at the bacterial cell surface by an extracellular bioorthogonal probe, as judged by confocal fluorescence microscopy. biochemical assays using both wild-type and mutant x. nematophila cells showed that rhabduscin was necessary and sufficient for potent inhibition (low nm) of phenoloxidases, the enzymes responsible for producing melanin (the hard black polymer insects generate to seal off microbial pathogens). these observations suggest a model in which rhabduscin's physical association at the bacterial cell surface provides a highly effective inhibitor concentration directly at the site of phenoloxidase contact. this class of molecules is not limited to insect pathogens, as the human pathogen vibrio cholerae also encodes rhabduscin's aglycone, and bacterial cell-coated immunosuppressants could be a general strategy to combat host defenses.
transcriptional analysis and functional characterization of a gene pair encoding  iron-regulated xenocin and immunity proteins of xenorhabdus nematophila.
we describe a two-gene cluster encoding a bacteriocin, xenocin, and the cognate immunity protein in the insect-pathogenic bacterium xenorhabdus nematophila, which infects and kills larval stages of the common crop pest helicoverpa armigera. the two genes, xcina and ximb, are present in the genome as a single transcriptional unit, which is regulated under sos conditions. the stress-inducible promoter was activated by mitomycin c, glucose, and fe(3+) depletion and at an elevated temperature when it was tested in escherichia coli cells. expression of the xenocin protein alone in e. coli inhibited the growth of this organism. the growth inhibition was abolished when the immunity protein was also present. a recombinant xenocin-immunity protein complex inhibited the growth of e. coli indicator cells when it was added exogenously to a growing culture. xenocin is an endoribonuclease with an enzymatically active c-terminal domain. six resident bacterial species (i.e., bacillus, enterobacter, enterococcus, citrobacter, serratia, and stenotrophomonas species) from the h. armigera gut exhibited sensitivity to recombinant xenocin when the organisms were grown under iron-depleted conditions and at a high temperature. xenocin also inhibited the growth of two xenorhabdus isolates. this study demonstrates that fe(3+) depletion acts as a common cue for synthesis of xenocin by x. nematophila and sensitization of the target strains to the bacteriocin.
an entomopathogenic bacterium, xenorhabdus nematophila, inhibits the expression of an antibacterial peptide, cecropin, of the beet armyworm, spodoptera exigua.
an entomopathogenic bacterium, xenorhabdus nematophila, is known to depress hemocyte nodule formation of target insects by inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis. this study analyzed the inhibitory effect of x. nematophila on the humoral immunity of the target insects and tested its association with the host eicosanoid pathway. plasma collected from the fifth instar larvae of spodoptera exigua, when they were injected with x. nematophila, did not show antibacterial activity against escherichia coli by a growth inhibition zone assay. in comparison, heat-killed x. nematophila induced significant antibacterial activity in the plasma. the antibacterial humoral activity was further demonstrated by examining a specific potent antibacterial peptide, cecropin. two cecropin genes ('a' and 'b') were partially cloned from the fifth instar larvae of s. exigua by conserved degenerate primers using nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). they showed high homologies with known cecropins from other lepidopteran species. northern analysis using the cecropin probe showed that the injection of the heat-killed x. nematophila induced significant expression of a cecropin mrna transcript (approximately 1.1 kb), but the larvae injected with the live bacteria did not show the corresponding transcript. injection of arachidonic acid did not rescue the inhibition of x. nematophila based on either antibacterial activity or cecropin gene expression. the addition of dexamethasone, a specific phospholipase a2 inhibitor, did not inhibit antibacterial activity or cecropin gene expression when the larvae were injected with heat-killed x. nematophila. these results suggest that x. nematophila inhibits the antibacterial humoral immune reaction as well as the cellular immune reaction in s. exigua and that the inhibition of x. nematophila on the expression of the antibacterial peptide is not associated with inhibition of the eicosanoid pathway.
antimicrobial activity and biosynthesis of indole antibiotics produced by xenorhabdus nematophilus.
we have investigated the mechanism of action and physiology of production of the  indole derivative antibiotics produced by the nematode-associated, entomopathogenic bacterium xenorhabdus nematophilus. maximum antibiotic concentration was reached during the late stationary phase of growth, and the antibiotic yield was appreciably enhanced by supplementation with tryptophan. antibiotic biosynthesis apparently involved the removal of the side-chain carboxyl (c-1) carbon of tryptophan. the c-3 methylene carbon of tryptophan, on the other hand, was retained. the purified indole antibiotic was effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at low to moderate concentrations causing a severe inhibition of rna synthesis, accompanied by a less severe effect on protein synthesis. an isogenic pair of escherichia coli strains differing at the rela locus was used to demonstrate that the swift reduction in total rna synthesis is related to an antibiotic-induced accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide, ppgpp, in susceptible bacteria. the e. coli rela mutant, which does not exhibit any discernible increase in ppgpp upon antibiotic treatment, showed no decrease in growth or rna synthesis. using this antibiotic, it was also observed that ppgpp may be employed as a metabolic regulator in bacteria such as pseudomonas putida, which have not previously been reported to employ ppgpp as a regulatory molecule. we propose that the indole derivative antibiotic exerts growth inhibitory control in susceptible bacteria by greatly enhancing synthesis of ppgpp, resulting in a rapid inhibition of rna synthesis.
