TI  - Identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  - Gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. The confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular species within this group of organisms. This investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. Clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16S rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Forty-three reference strains of 19 Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. The phenotypic screen easily differentiated Porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. The screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. Commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of Porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to species level with the kits. Neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate Pr. intermedia and Pr. nigrescens. With the PCR method, Pr. intermedia and Pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and Porph. gingivalis was readily identified. Because of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, Pr. melaninogenica and Pr. veroralis could not be separated by the PCR method.
TI  - New findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'Streptococcus milleri'-group, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, P. intermedia, P. oralis and unidentified Prevotella spp. Two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas Prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. The large proportion of non-pigmented Prevotella species, P. asaccharolytica and B. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. The role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'Streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before treatment. Bacteroides ureolyticus, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including Capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci, staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. Root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which P. intermedia, P. asaccharolytica, the P. veroralis/buccalis complex and C. ochracea were isolated. Regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.
