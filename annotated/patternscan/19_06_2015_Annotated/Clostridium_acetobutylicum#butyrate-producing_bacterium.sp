TI  == genes encoding homologues of three consecutive enzymes in the butyrate/butanol-producing pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum are clustered on the clostridium difficile chromosome.
AB  == screening of a clostridium difficile lambda embl3 gene library with antisera raised against c. difficile culture supernatant identified several clones expressing a 31-kda protein. a 1.8-kb hindiii fragment subcloned from one of the  clones was sufficient for expression of the 31-kda polypeptide. southern blot analysis showed a region homologous to this fragment to be present in all of 13 different c. difficile strains tested. sequence analysis of the 1.8-kb fragment revealed three adjacent open reading frames. a database search showed that these  three open reading frames appeared to encode homologues of three consecutive enzymes in the butanol/butyrate-producing pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum (crotonase, beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a dehydrogenase and thiolase).
