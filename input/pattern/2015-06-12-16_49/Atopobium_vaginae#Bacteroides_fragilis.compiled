TI  - Susceptibility testing of Atopobium vaginae for dequalinium chloride.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis are major markers for bacterial vaginosis. We aimed to determine the MIC and MBC range of the broad-spectrum anti-infective and antiseptic dequalinium chloride for 28 strains, belonging to 4 species of the genus Atopobium, i.e. A. vaginae, A. minutum, A. rimae and A. parvulum. METHODS: The MIC was determined with a broth microdilution assay. RESULTS: The MIC and MBC for Atopobium spp. for dequalinium chloride ranged between < 0.0625 and 2 mug/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that dequalinium chloride inhibits and kills clinical isolates of A. vaginae at concentrations similar to those of clindamycin and lower than those of metronidazole.
