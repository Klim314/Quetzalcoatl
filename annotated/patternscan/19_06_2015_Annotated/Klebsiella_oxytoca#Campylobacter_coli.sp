TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of pathogenic bacteria in chicken and guinea fowl.
AB  == this study was conducted to compare the presence and antimicrobial susceptibility of campylobacter, salmonella spp., and other enteric bacteria between chickens and guinea fowls. birds were reared on enclosed concrete floor housing covered with pine wood shavings litter material. chicken (n = 40) and guinea fowl (n = 40) carcasses, drinking water (10 ml; n = 40), and litter (10 g; n = 40) were aseptically collected randomly from a poultry farm and analyzed within 1 h of collection. individual pens served as experimental units and were replicated twice. campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and other enterobactericeae were isolated and identified using standard selective media and biochemical tests. isolates were tested for sensitivity to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and colistin using the kirby-bauer disk diffusion test. campylobacter spp. and salmonella spp. were isolated from 28 and 35% of whole carcass rinses of chickens and from 18 and 23% of whole carcass rinses of guinea fowl, respectively. although only salmonella spp. were recovered from drinking water, both salmonella and campylobacter spp. were recovered from litter material. campylobacter upsaliensis was recovered only in the guinea fowl, whereas klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter sakazakii were recovered only in chickens. although no antibiotic resistance was determined in campylobacter upsaliensis, most campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli isolates from both chickens and guinea fowl were resistant to antibiotics such as ampicillin, kanamycin, erythromycin, and nalidixic acid.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == comparative value of colonic biopsy and intraluminal fluid culture for diagnosis  of bacterial acute colitis in immunocompetent patients. infectious colitis study  group.
AB  == we compared the yield of intraluminal fluid culture to that of biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy for the diagnosis of bacterial colitis in 93 immunocompetent patients with a recent episode of diarrhea and macroscopic lesions of colitis. stool culture findings were also available for 68 patients. at least one bacterial pathogen was isolated from the biopsy specimen, intraluminal fluid, or stool from 48 patients (51.6%). salmonella species, clostridium difficile, klebsiella oxytoca, shigella species, and campylobacter species were recovered from 16 (17.2%), 15 (16.1%), 8 (8.6%), 7 (7.5%), and 4 (4.3%) of the patients, respectively. one shigella species and one k. oxytoca strain were isolated from biopsy specimens but not from intraluminal fluid, and intraluminal fluid was the only positive specimen in 12 cases (yielding 1 salmonella species, 2 shigella species, 2 k. oxytoca, and 7 c. difficile isolates). in nine cases out of 10, toxin b was detected only in intraluminal fluid. a correlation of 91.2% was observed between stool and intraluminal fluid cultures for salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter species isolations. culture  of biopsy specimens adds little to the diagnosis of infectious colitis, and stools and intraluminal fluids appear to have comparable value.

TI  == inhibition of acid secretion from parietal cells by non-human-infecting helicobacter species: a factor in colonization of gastric mucosa?
AB  == helicobacter pylori has been shown to produce a protein that inhibits acid secretion from parietal cells. we have examined other non-human-infecting helicobacter species for this property by measuring the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine into rabbit parietal cells as an indirect assessment of acid secretion. helicobacter felis and an isolate from a rhesus monkey were shown to inhibit acid secretion. isolates of helicobacter mustelae gave variable responses. whole bacteria and cell-free sonicates impaired the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine. we also tested other bacteria, including escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, and campylobacter jejuni. as whole organisms, these control bacteria had little effect on acid secretion, but sonicates caused pronounced inhibition that was partially heat labile. pronase treatment of h. pylori destroyed its inhibitory effect. these results suggest that most helicobacter species, but not all isolates, are able to inhibit acid secretion from rabbit parietal cells. this property may be a factor in the establishment of long-term infection by these species.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four gram-positive and sixteen gram-negative bacteria. dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant serratia sp., proteus vulgaris, p. rettgeri and klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against gram-positive bacteria and  some gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogens, e. cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejunii. dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
