TI  == association of symptoms with gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == aim: to investigate the correlations between self-reported symptoms of irritable  bowel syndrome (ibs) and the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiota composition. methods: fecal samples were collected from a total of 44 subjects diagnosed with  ibs. their symptoms were monitored with a validated inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire adjusted for ibs patients. thirteen quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were applied to evaluate the gi microbiota composition. eubacteria and gi bacterial genera (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and veillonella), groups (clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale, desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and distinct bacterial phylotypes [closest 16s rdna  sequence resemblance to species bifidobacterium catenulatum, clostridium cocleatum, collinsella aerofaciens (c. aerofaciens), coprococcus eutactus (c. eutactus), ruminococcus torques and streptococcus bovis] with a suspected association with ibs were quantified. correlations between quantities or presence/absence data of selected bacterial groups or phylotypes and various ibs-related symptoms were investigated. results: associations were observed between subjects' self-reported symptoms and the presence or quantities of certain gi bacteria. a ruminococcus torques (r. torques)-like (94% similarity in  16s rrna gene sequence) phylotype was associated with severity of bowel symptoms. furthermore, among ibs subjects with r. torques 94% detected, the amounts of c. cocleatum 88%, c. aerofaciens-like and c. eutactus 97% phylotypes were significantly reduced. interesting observations were also made concerning the effect of a subject's weight on gi microbiota with regard to c. aerofaciens-like  phylotype, bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. conclusion: bacteria seemingly affecting the symptom scores are unlikely to be the underlying cause or cure of ibs, but they may serve as biomarkers of the condition.

TI  == dominant and diet-responsive groups of bacteria within the human colonic microbiota.
AB  == the populations of dominant species within the human colonic microbiota can potentially be modified by dietary intake with consequences for health. here we examined the influence of precisely controlled diets in 14 overweight men. volunteers were provided successively with a control diet, diets high in resistant starch (rs) or non-starch polysaccharides (nsps) and a reduced carbohydrate weight loss (wl) diet, over 10 weeks. analysis of 16s rrna sequences in stool samples of six volunteers detected 320 phylotypes (defined at >98% identity) of which 26, including 19 cultured species, each accounted for >1% of sequences. although samples clustered more strongly by individual than by diet, time courses obtained by targeted qpcr revealed that 'blooms' in specific bacterial groups occurred rapidly after a dietary change. these were rapidly reversed by the subsequent diet. relatives of ruminococcus bromii (r-ruminococci) increased in most volunteers on the rs diet, accounting for a mean of 17% of total bacteria compared with 3.8% on the nsp diet, whereas the uncultured oscillibacter group increased on the rs and wl diets. relatives of eubacterium rectale increased on rs (to mean 10.1%) but decreased, along with collinsella aerofaciens, on wl. inter-individual variation was marked, however, with >60% of  rs remaining unfermented in two volunteers on the rs diet, compared to <4% in the other 12 volunteers; these two individuals also showed low numbers of r-ruminococci (<1%). dietary non-digestible carbohydrate can produce marked changes in the gut microbiota, but these depend on the initial composition of an  individual's gut microbiota.
