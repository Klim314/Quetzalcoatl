TI  == a comparison of in-house real-time lamp assays with a commercial assay for the detection of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == molecular detection of bacterial pathogens based on lamp methods is a faster and  simpler approach than conventional culture methods. although different lamp-based methods for pathogenic bacterial detection are available, a systematic comparison of these different lamp assays has not been performed. in this paper, we compared 12 in-house real-time lamp assays with a commercialized kit (isothermal master mix) for the detection of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp, staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli o157, e. coli o26, e. coli o45, e. coli o103, e. coli o111, e. coli o121, e. coli o145 and streptococcus agalactiae. false-positive results were observed in all 12 in-house real-time lamp assays, while all the negative controls of isothermal master mix remained negative after amplification. the detection limit of isothermal master mix for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157, e. coli o26, e. coli o45, e. coli o103, e. coli o111, e. coli o121 and streptococcus agalactiae was 1 pg, whereas the sensitivity of the commercialized kit for e. coli o145 was  100 pg. in conclusion, the 12 in-house real-time lamp assays were impractical to  use, while the commercialized kit isothermal master mix was useful for the detection of most bacterial pathogens.

TI  == selecting anti-microbial treatment of aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == aerobic vaginitis (av) is a vaginal infectious condition which is often confused  with bacterial vaginosis (bv) or with the intermediate microflora as diagnosed by nugent's method to detect bv on gram-stained specimens. however, although both conditions reflect a state of lactobacillary disruption in the vagina, leading to an increase in ph, bv and av differ profoundly. while bv is a noninflammatory condition composed of a multiplex array of different anaerobic bacteria in high quantities, av is rather sparely populated by one or two enteric commensal flora  bacteria, like streptococcus agalactiae, staphylocuccus aureus, or escherichia coli. av is typically marked by either an increased inflammatory response or by prominent signs of epithelial atrophy or both. the latter condition, if severe, is also called desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. as av is per exclusionem diagnosed by wet mount microscopy, it is a mistake to treat just vaginal culture  results. vaginal cultures only serve as follow-up data in clinical research projects and are at most used in clinical practice to confirm the diagnosis or exclude candida infection. av requires treatment based on microscopy findings and a combined local treatment with any of the following which may yield the best results: antibiotic (infectious component), steroids (inflammatory component), and/or estrogen (atrophy component). in cases with candida present on microscopy  or culture, antifungals must be tried first in order to see if other treatment is still needed. vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide rapid relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. local antibiotics most suitable are preferably non-absorbed and broad spectrum, especially those covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, like kanamycin. to achieve rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms, oral therapy with amoxyclav or moxifloxacin can be used, especially in deep dermal vulvitis and colpitis infections with group b streptococci or (methicillin resistant) staphylococcus aureus. since the latter colonizations are frequent, but seldom inflammatory infections, we in general discourage the use of oral antibiotics in women with av. in cases with a severe atrophy component (more than 10 % of epithelial cells are of the parabasal type), local estrogens can be used; and in postmenopausal or breast cancer patients with a contraindication for estrogens, even a combination of probiotics with an ultra-low dose of local estriol may be considered.

TI  == beta-defensin in nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus): sequence, tissue expression, and anti-bacterial activity of synthetic peptides.
AB  == beta-defensins (beta-defensins) are small cationic amphiphilic peptides that are  widely distributed in plants, insects, and vertebrates, and are important for their antimicrobial properties. in this study, the beta-defensin (onbeta-defensin) gene of the nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus) was cloned from spleen tissue. onbeta-defensin has a genomic dna sequence of 674bp and produces a cdna of 454bp. sequence alignments showed that onbeta-defensin contains three exons and two introns. sequence analysis of the cdna identified an open reading frame of 201bp, encoding 66 amino acids. bioinformatic analysis showed that onbeta-defensin encodes a cytoplasmic protein molecule containing a signal peptide. the deduced amino acid sequence of this peptide contains six conserved cysteine residues and two conserved glycine residues, and shows 81.82%  and 78.33% sequence similarities with beta-defensin-1 of fugu (takifugu rubripes) and rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss), respectively. real-time quantitative pcr showed that the level of onbeta-defensin expression was highest in the skin (307.1-fold), followed by the spleen (77.3-fold), kidney (17.8-fold), and muscle  (16.5-fold) compared to controls. by contrast, low levels of expression were found in the liver, heart, intestine, stomach, and gill (<3.0-fold). artificial infection of tilapia with streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs] strain) resulted in a significantly upregulated expression of onbeta-defensin in  the skin, muscle, kidney, and gill. in vitro antimicrobial experiments showed that a synthetic onbeta-defensin polypeptide had a certain degree of inhibitory effect on the growth of escherichia coli dh5alpha and s. agalactiae. the results  indicate that onbeta-defensin plays a role in immune responses that suppress or kill pathogens.

TI  == [profile and susceptibility to antibiotics in urinary tract infections in children and newborns from 2012 to 2013: data from 1879 urine cultures].
AB  == introduction: we present recent data on the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogenic bacteria isolated in children and newborns in our region over the past 2years. materials and methods: a retrospective study on the positive urine cultures from pediatric and neonatal populations during 2012-2013. bacteria were identified using conventional methods. susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted as recommended by the committee of the susceptibility of the french society of microbiology (ca-sfm). results: we collected 1879 non-redundant bacteria with more than 73% escherichia coli. children and infants (mean age, 32months [range, 1month to 14years]) accounted for 84% of the bacteria collected and newborns (mean age, 12days [range, 1day to 1month]) 16%. a female predominance was observed in the pediatric population (m:f sex ratio, 3.2), whereas for the neonatal population, the proportions were almost identical in both sexes (m:f sex ratio, 1.1). most of the positive urine cultures (n=1234) were from the community. hospitalized patients (n=636) were divided into pediatric (60%) and neonatal units (40%). five bacterial genera dominated the bacteriological profile: e. coli, klebsiella sp.,  proteus sp., enterobacter sp., and enterococcus. the susceptibility of the main bup antibiotics used for treatment of frequent uti showed the effectiveness of furadoine, imipenem, fosfomycin, and colistin. amoxicillin kept constant activity against enterococcus and streptococcus agalactiae. the rates of resistance of enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam antibiotics were high, especially in the neonatal population. the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) was noted in 12.8% of pediatric enterobacteria vs. 22.6% of the neonatal strains. for community enterobacteriaceae, the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics was limited with 11.2% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (c3g), including 8.6% esbl production. conclusion: the impact of widespread use of beta-lactam antibiotics in neonatal and pediatric environments is felt. colistin, imipenem, and fosfomycin are the most frequently used antibiotics active against bacteria responsible for neonatal and pediatric uti; however, they cannot be used as probabilistic treatment. nitrofurans seem to be active antibiotics on uti, but they present limits in their use in neonatal and pediatric populations. their indication in case of pyelonephritis should be discussed.

TI  == a c-type lectin from bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  == bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against s. aureus nrs155. crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against s. aureus. biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were  also assayed against s. epidermidis nrs101. fraction 15 was identified by tripletof mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding c-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kda. the lectin was purified from the crude venom by d-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. this pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of s. aureus and s. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. the lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. the antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. a pre-formed s. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the c-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of s. aureus, s. hyicus, s. chromogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and escherichia coli. these findings reveal a new activity for c-type lectins. studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.

TI  == effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by animal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: resistance toward quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs) is widespread  among a diverse range of microorganisms and is facilitated by several mechanisms  such as biofilm formation. objectives: in this study, the effects of benzalkonium chloride on planktonic growth and biofilm formation by some field isolates of animal bacterial pathogens were investigated. materials and methods: forty clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella serotypes, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae (10 isolates of each) were examined for effects of benzalkonium chloride on biofilm formation and planktonic growth using microtiter plates. for all the examined strains in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of disinfectant. results: the means of strains growth increase after the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) were significant in all the bacteria (except for e. coli in 1/32 and s. agalactiae in of 1/8 mic). biofilm formation increased with decrease of antiseptics concentration; a significant increase was found in all the samples. the most turbidity related to s. aureus and the least to salmonella. conclusions: bacterial resistance against quaternary ammonium compounds is increasing which can increase the bacterial biofilm formation.

TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == an homolog of the frz phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system  of extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli is encoded on a genomic island in  specific lineages of streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == we identified a streptococcus agalactiae metabolic region (fru2) coding for a phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts) homologous to the frz system of extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli strains. the frz system is involved in environmental sensing and regulation of the expression of adaptation and virulence genes in e. coli. the s. agalactiae fru2 region codes three subunits of a pts transporter of the fructose-mannitol family, a transcriptional activator of ptss of the mtlr family, an allulose-6 phosphate-3-epimerase, a transaldolase and a transketolase. we demonstrated that  all these genes form an operon. the fru2 operon is present in a 17494-bp genomic  island. we analyzed by multilocus sequence typing a population of 492 strains representative of the s. agalactiae population and we showed that the presence of the fru2 operon is linked to the phylogeny of s. agalactiae. the fru2 operon is always present within strains of clonal complexes cc 1, cc 7, cc 10, cc 283 and singletons st 130 and st 288, but never found in other ccs and sts. our results indicate that the fru2 operon was acquired during the evolution of the s. agalactiae species from a common ancestor before the divergence of cc 1, cc 7, cc 10, cc 283, st 130 and st 288. as s. agalactiae strains of cc 1 and cc 10 are frequently isolated from adults with invasive disease, we hypothesize that the s. agalactiae fru2 system senses the environment to allow the bacterium to adapt to  new conditions encountered during the infection of adults.

TI  == reduction of lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  == clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. the mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (scc). although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk scc, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and scc have not been determined previously. thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. the overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. the lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative pcr. mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. based on comparison with the pairwise mann-whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (p=0.0175), but lower e. coli (p=0.0002), s. aureus (p<0.0001), s. agalactiae (p=0.0001) and t. pyogenes (p=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. the negative correlation between lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the scc, was confirmed with spearman correlation analysis. data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial protein and peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == objective: we investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (amps) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (los), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in  the neonatal period. study design: breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. concentrations of lactoferrin, ll-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of amps. samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent los were compared for levels of amps and inhibition of bacterial growth. results: levels of most amps and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. lactoferrin was the only amp that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. levels of amps were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without los, however, infants who developed los consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk amps than those who were free from los. conclusions: the concentrations of lactoferrin and  defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.

TI  == metabolic fate of unsaturated glucuronic/iduronic acids from glycosaminoglycans:  molecular identification and structure determination of streptococcal isomerase and dehydrogenase.
AB  == glycosaminoglycans in mammalian extracellular matrices are degraded to their constituents, unsaturated uronic (glucuronic/iduronic) acids and amino sugars, through successive reactions of bacterial polysaccharide lyase and unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase. genes coding for glycosaminoglycan-acting lyase, unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, and the phosphotransferase system are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococci and clostridia. here, we studied the streptococcal metabolic pathway of unsaturated uronic acids and the structure/function relationship of its relevant isomerase and dehydrogenase. two proteins (gbs1892 and gbs1891) of streptococcus agalactiae strain nem316 were overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. 4-deoxy-l-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate (dhu) nonenzymatically generated from unsaturated uronic acids was converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate via 3-deoxy-d-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate through successive reactions of gbs1892 isomerase (dhui) and gbs1891 nadh-dependent reductase/dehydrogenase (dhud). dhui and dhud enzymatically corresponded to 4-deoxy-l-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase (kdui) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate dehydrogenase (kdud), respectively, involved in pectin metabolism, although no or low sequence identity was observed between dhui and kdui or between dhud and kdud, respectively. genes for dhui and dhud were found to be included in the streptococcal genetic cluster, whereas kdui and kdud are encoded in clostridia. tertiary and quaternary structures of dhui and dhud were determined by x-ray crystallography. distinct from kdui beta-barrels, dhui adopts an alpha/beta/alpha-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to that of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase. the structure of dhud is unable to accommodate the  substrate/cofactor, suggesting that conformational changes are essential to trigger enzyme catalysis. this is the first report on the bacterial metabolism of glycosaminoglycan-derived unsaturated uronic acids by isomerase and dehydrogenase.

AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == effects of cathode design parameters on in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of electrically-activated silver-based iontophoretic system.
AB  == post-operative infection is a major risk associated with implantable devices. prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ionic silver as an alternative to antibiotic-based infection prophylaxis and treatment. the focus of this study is on an electrically activated implant system engineered for active release of antimicrobial silver ions. the objective was to evaluate the effects of the cathode design, especially the cathode material, on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the system. a modified kirby-bauer diffusion technique  was used for the antimicrobial efficacy evaluations (24 h testing interval). in phase-1 of the study, a three-way anova (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was performed to determine the effects of cathode material (silver, titanium, and stainless steel), cathode surface area and electrode separation distance on the efficacy of the system against staphylococcus aureus. the results show that within the design space tested, none of these parameters had a statistically significant effect on  the antimicrobiality of the system (p > 0.15). subsequently, one-way anova (n = 6, alpha = 0.05) was conducted in phase-2 to validate the inference regarding the non-significance of the cathode material to the system efficacy using a broader spectrum of pathogens (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and aspergillus flavus) responsible for osteomyelitis. the results confirmed the lack of statistical difference between efficacies of the three cathode material configurations against all pathogens tested (p > 0.58). overall, the results demonstrate the ability to alter the cathode material and related design parameters in order to minimize the silver usage in the system without adversely affecting its antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == inducible expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein by interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-1beta and toll-like receptor 2 promoters in goat mammary epithelial cells in response to bacterial challenges.
AB  == the development of a bacteria-inducible expression system has several advantages  compared with persistent expression of anti-bacterial proteins in milk to prevent and treat mastitis. the present study determined whether mastitis responsive promoters could regulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) expression in  goat mammary epithelial cells (gmecs) in response to challenges with escherichia  coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. the level of expression  of interleukin (il)-1alpha was significantly increased in gmecs challenged with e. coli, s. aureus or s. agalactiae compared with untreated gmecs. il-1beta was induced by e. coli and s. aureus, while toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) was induced by e. coli only. gmecs were transfected with il-1alpha, il-1beta and tlr2 promoter-egfp reporter gene lentiviral expression vectors and the levels of expression of egfp were measured by flow cytometry and western blot analysis after bacterial challenge. egfp expression driven by the il-1alpha and il-1beta promoters was higher in gmecs challenged with e. coli, s. aureus or s. agalactiae than in untreated gmecs. there were no differences in egfp expression driven by the tlr2 promoter between gmecs challenged with s. aureus or s. agalactiae and untreated gmecs, but egfp expression was significantly increased in gmecs challenged with e. coli. overall, these results indicate that the promoters of some bacteria-inducible genes can regulate egfp expression in gmecs in response to bacterial challenges. this bacteria-inducible expression strategy could be used for production of mastitis resistant animals by regulating the expression of anti-bacterial proteins in the mammary gland.

TI  == prevalence and predictors of bacterial meningitis in young infants with fever without a source.
AB  == background: classical criteria differ when performing cerebrospinal fluid (csf) analysis in infants younger than 90 days with fever without a source (fws). our objectives were to analyze the prevalence and microbiology of bacterial meningitis in this group and its prevalence in relation to clinical and laboratory risk factors. methods: this is a substudy of a prospective registry including all infants of this age with fws seen between september 2003 and august 2013 in a pediatric emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital. results: lumbar puncture was performed in 639 (27.0%) of the 2362 infants with fws seen, the rate being higher in not well-appearing infants [60.9% vs. 25.7%; odds ratio (or), 4.49] and in those </=21 days old (70.1% vs. 20.4%; or, 9.14). eleven infants were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis: 9 were </=21 days old (prevalence 2.8% vs. 0.1%; or, 30.42) and 5 were not well-appearing infants (5.7% vs. 0.2%; or, 23.06). bacteria isolated were streptococcus agalactiae (3), escherichia coli (3), listeria monocytogenes (3), streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and neisseria meningitidis (1). none of the 1975 well-appearing infants >21 days  old were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, regardless of whether biomarkers were altered. conclusions: in infants younger than 90 days with fws, performing csf analysis for ruling out bacterial meningitis must be strongly considered in not well-appearing infants and in those </=21 days old. the recommendation of systematically performing csf analysis in well-appearing infants 22-90 days of age on the basis of analytical criteria alone must be reevaluated.

TI  == incidence of invasive group b streptococcal disease and pathogen genotype distribution in newborn babies in the netherlands over 25 years: a nationwide surveillance study.
AB  == background: group b streptococcus is the most common cause of neonatal infections. we studied the clinical and molecular epidemiology of invasive group  b streptococcus infection in children younger than 3 months in the netherlands over 25 years. we assessed the effect of the dutch guidelines, introduced in 1999, for prevention of group b streptococcus, consisting of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis during labour in cases of premature labour, prolonged rupture of membranes, or fever during delivery. methods: we did this nationwide surveillance study with data from 1987 to 2011, from the netherlands reference laboratory for bacterial meningitis. we included data for patients aged 3 months  or younger with positive blood culture or cerebrospinal fluid culture for group b streptococcus and escherichia coli infection. early onset was defined as less than 7 days after birth and late onset was defined as 7 or more days after birth. we did multilocus sequence typing of a random subset of group b streptococcus samples to assess changes in sequence type (mann-kendall trend test) and the distribution of clonal complexes (chi(2) and fisher exact test) before the introduction of prevention guidelines (1987-99) and afterwards (2000-11). we compared incidences and the distribution of clonal complexes before and after the introduction of guidelines. findings: most cases of group b streptococcus had early onset (696/1075; 65%). the incidence of invasive group b streptococcus infection increased from 0.20 per 1000 livebirths in 1987, to 0.32 per 1000 livebirths in 2011 (p<0.0001). the incidence of early-onset disease increased from 0.11 per 1000 livebirths to 0.19 per 1000 livebirths (p<0.0001). the incidence of invasive escherichia coli infection was 0.05 in 1987, and 0.16 in 2011 (p=0.17). early-onset group b streptococcus infection caused by isolates belonging to clonal complex 17 was more common in the post-implementation period  than in the pre-implementation period (p=0.002). interpretation: the introduction of prevention guidelines for invasive group b streptococcus disease in 1999 did not reduce the incidence of disease in neonates. the guidelines should be reassessed and alternative approaches to prevent infant invasive group b streptococcus disease should be sought. funding: national institute of public health and the environment, the european union's seventh framework programme, netherlands organization for health research and development, academic medical center, and the european research council.

TI  == the salivary scavenger and agglutinin in early life: diverse roles in amniotic fluid and in the infant intestine.
AB  == the salivary scavenger and agglutinin (salsa), also known as gp340 and dmbt1, is  an antimicrobial and inflammation-regulating molecule located at the mucosal surfaces. the present study revealed that salsa was present in the amniotic fluid (af) and exceptionally enriched in both meconium and feces of infants. based on immunological and mass spectrometric analysis, salsa was estimated to constitute  up to 4-10% of the total protein amount in meconium, making it one of the most abundant proteins. salsa proteins in the af and intestinal samples were polymorphic and exhibited varying polypeptide compositions. in particular, a different abundance of peptides corresponding to functionally important structures was found in the af and intestinal salsa. the af form of salsa had a more intact structure and contained peptides from the zona pellucida domain, which is involved in cell differentiation and oligomerization. in contrast, the intestinal salsa was more enriched with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. the af, but not the meconium salsa, bound to streptococcus pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. gordonii, and escherichia coli. furthermore, differential binding  was observed also to known endogenous ligands c1q, mannose-binding lectin, and secretory iga. our results have thus identified mucosal body compartments, where  salsa is particularly abundant, and suggest that salsa exhibits varying functions in the different mucosal locations. the high levels of salsa in af and the infant intestine suggest a robust and important function for salsa during the fetal development and in the mucosal innate immune defense of infants.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == bacteremia in previously healthy children in emergency departments: clinical and  microbiological characteristics and outcome.
AB  == a blood culture (bc) is frequently requested in both patients with a suspected occult bacteremia/invasive infection as well as those with certain focal infections. few data are available on the characteristics of patients in whom a bacteremia is identified in the pediatric emergency department (ped). a prospective multicenter registry was established by the spanish pediatric emergency society. epidemiological data, complementary test results, clinical management, and final outcome were recorded. data from the first three years of the registry were analyzed. a true bacterial pathogen grew in 932 of 65,169 bcs collected [1.43 %; 95 % confidence interval (ci) 1.34-1.51 %], with 711 of them collected in patients without previously known bacteremia risk factors. among them, 335 (47.1 %) were younger than 1 year old and 467 (65.7 %) had a normal pediatric assessment triangle (pat) on admission. overall, the most frequently isolated bacterial species was streptococcus pneumoniae (27.3 %; 47.6 % among patients with an altered pat). the main pathogens were escherichia coli (40.3 %)  and s. agalactiae (35.7 %) among patients younger than 3 months, s. pneumoniae among patients 3-60 months old (40.0 %), and s. aureus (31.9 %) among patients over 60 months of age. neisseria meningitidis was the leading cause of sepsis in  patients older than 3 months. eight patients died; none of them had a pneumococcal bacteremia and all had abnormal pat findings on admission. s. pneumoniae is the main cause of bacteremia in patients without bacteremia risk factors who attended spanish peds. age and general appearance influence the frequency of each bacterial species. general appearance also influences the associated mortality.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of recombinant siganus oramin l-amino acid oxidase expressed in pichia pastoris.
AB  == siganus oraminl-amino acid oxidase is a novel natural protein (named sr-laao) isolated from serum of the rabbitfish (s. oramin), which showed antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and had a lethal effect on the parasites cryptocaryon irritans, trypanosoma brucei brucei and ichthyophthirius multifiliis. in order to test whether recombinant sr-laao (rsr-laao) produced by the eukaryotic expression system also has antimicrobial activity, the yeast pichia pastoris was used as the expression host to obtain rsr-laao in vitro. crude rsr-laao produced by p. pastoris integrated with the sr-laao gene had antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as shown by inhibition zone assay of the antibacterial spectrum on agar plates. the average diameter of the inhibition zone of crude rsr-laao against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae was 1.040 +/- 0.045 cm and 1.209 +/- 0.085 cm, respectively. for the gram-negative bacteria aeromonas sobria, escherichia coli,  vibrio alginolyticus, vibrio cholera and photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, the average diameter of inhibition zone was 1.291 +/- 0.089 cm, 0.943  +/- 0.061 cm, 0.756 +/- 0.057 cm, 0.834 +/- 0.023 cm and 1.211 +/- 0.026 cm, respectively. these results were obtained at the logarithmic growth phase of s. agalactiae and a. sobria cell suspensions after incubation with 0.5 mg/ml crude rsr-laao for 24 h. the final bacterial growth rate was decreased significantly. the relative inhibition rate can reach 50% compared to crude products from p. pastoris integrated with an empty vector at the same concentration of protein. the antimicrobial activity of crude rsr-laao was likely associated with h2o2 formation, because its inhibition zones were disturbed significantly by catalase. scanning electron microscopy results showed crude rsr-laao-treated bacterial surfaces became rough and particles were attached, cell walls were retracted and  cell membranes were ruptured. together, the results of this study indicated rsr-laao from the p. pastoris expression system is a potential antibiotic for application as a therapeutic agent against bacterial diseases.

TI  == phosphoglycerate kinase enhanced immunity of the whole cell of streptococcus agalactiae in tilapia, oreochromis niloticus.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is a gram-positive bacterium and a severe aquaculture pathogen that can infect a wide range of warmwater fish species. the outer-surface proteins in bacterial pathogens play an important role in pathogenesis. we evaluated the immunogenicity of two of the identified surface proteins namely phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) and ornithine carbamoyl-transferase (oct). pgk and oct were over-expressed and purified from escherichia coli and used as the subunit vaccines in tilapia. tilapia immunized with the s. agalactiae modified bacteria vaccine (whole cell preparations with recombinant pgk and oct proteins) individually were tested for the efficacy. oct and pgk combined with wc had a higher survival rate. a high-level protection and significant specific antibody responses against s. agalactiae challenge was observed upon the vaccinated tilapia with the purified pgk protein and s. agalactiae whole cells. the specific antibody titer against s. agalactiae antigen suggested that increased antibody titers were correlated with post-challenge survival rate. il-1beta expression profile was higher in pgk + wc-treated group. tnf-alpha expression in the pgk + wc group was significantly increased. taken together, our results suggested the combinations of recombinant protein and whole cell may elicit immune responses that reach greater protection than that of individual s.  agalactiae components.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

AB  == incidence of neonatal early-onset sepsis has dramatically declined in france from 0.65 to 0.23 per thousand live births in 10 years since national guidelines to detect and treat intrapartum women with group b streptococcus colonization have been adopted. however, neonatal early-onset sepsis continues to be a common healthcare burden. group b streptococcus (gbs) remains the leading cause of bacterial infection in term or near-term infants. as a result of prevention strategies, approximately 30% of pregnant women and more than 2% of newborns are  treated with systemic antibiotics. concerns have been expressed about the safety  of wide use of antibiotics such as antibiotic resistance, emergence of escherichia coli infections, and long-term side effects due to gut microbiota modifications. new recommendations from the centers of disease control in the united states and from european countries aim at improving gbs detection methods, updating algorithms for gbs intrapartum chemoprophylaxis in pregnant women, defining high-risk newborns more efficiently, and limiting biological evaluation  in low-risk newborns.

TI  == development of a multiplex real-time pcr assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  == the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (los), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by pcr would provide a much more timely result. unfortunately, pcr-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. therefore we developed a real-time multiplex pcr assay tailored to los diagnosis  which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. species-specific pcr assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp. and serratia marcescens. the pcr assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (lod) of </=10cfueq./reaction. these lod values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial dna was isolated from blood. clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex pcr and blood culture. in conclusion, we developed a multiplex pcr that allows the direct detection of the most important  bacterial pathogens causing los in preterm infants.

TI  == cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from streptococcus agalactiae nem316.
AB  == glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) is an essential enzyme involved  in glycolysis. despite lacking the secretory signal sequence, this cytosolic enzyme has been found localized at the surface of several bacteria and fungi. as  a surface protein, gapdh exhibits various adhesive functions, thereby facilitating colonization and invasion of host tissues. streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group b streptococcus (gbs), binds onto the host using its surface  adhesins and causes sepsis and pneumonia in neonates. gapdh is one of the surface adhesins of gbs binding to human plasminogen and is a virulent factor associated  with host colonization. although the surface-associated gapdh has been shown to bind to a variety of host extracellular matrix (ecm) molecules in various bacteria, the molecular mechanism underlying their interaction is not fully understood. to investigate this, structural studies on gapdh of s. agalactiae were initiated. the gapc gene of s. agalactiae nem316 encoding gapdh protein was  cloned into pet-28a vector, overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3) cells and purified to homogeneity. the purified protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. the gapdh crystals obtained in two different crystallization conditions diffracted to 2.8 and 2.6 a resolution, belonging to two different space groups p2(1) and p2(1)2(1)2(1), respectively. the structure was solved by molecular replacement and structure refinement is now in progress.

AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == identification of a c-type lectin with antiviral and antibacterial activity from  pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei.
AB  == c-type lectins (ctls) play crucial roles in innate immune responses in invertebrates by recognizing and eliminating microinvaders. in this study, a ctl  from pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei (lvctl3) was identified. lvctl3 contains a single c-type lectin-like domain (ctld), which shows similarities to those of other shrimp ctls and has a mutated 'epd' motif in ca(2+)-binding site 2. lvctl3 mrna can be detected in all tested tissues and expression of lvctl3 in  gills was up-regulated after lipopolysaccharides, poly (i:c), vibrio parahaemolyticus and white spot syndrome virus (wssv) challenges, suggesting activation responses of lvctl3 to bacterial, virus and immune stimulant challenges. the 5'flanking regulatory region of lvctl3 was cloned and we identified a nf-kappab binding motif in the lvctl3 promoter region. dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that over-expression of l. vannamei dorsal can dramatically up regulate the promoter activity of lvctl3, suggesting that lvctl3 expression could be regulated through nf-kappab signaling pathway. as far as we know, this is the first report on signaling pathway involve in shrimp ctls expression. the recombinant lvctl3 protein was expressed in escherichia coli and purified by ni-affinity chromatography. the purified lvctl3 can agglutinate gram-negative microbe vibrio alginolyticus and v. parahaemolyticus and gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis in the presence of calcium ions, but cannot agglutinate gram-positive bacteria streptococcus agalactiae. the agglutination activity of lvctl3 was abolished when ca(2+) was chelated with edta, suggesting the function of lvctl3 is ca(2+)-dependent. in vivo challenge experiments showed that the recombinant lvctl3 protein can significantly reduce the mortalities of v. parahemolyticus and wssv infection, indicating lvctl3 might play significant roles in shrimp innate immunity defense against bacterial and viral infection.

TI  == evaluation of the minnesota easy culture system ii bi-plate and tri-plate for identification of common mastitis pathogens in milk.
AB  == the objective of this study was to validate use of the minnesota easy culture system ii bi-plate and tri-plate (university of minnesota laboratory for udder health, st. paul) to identify common mastitis pathogens in milk. a total of 283 quarter and composite milk samples submitted to the university of minnesota laboratory for udder health during the spring of 2010 were cultured simultaneously using 3 methods: standard laboratory culture (reference method) and the minnesota easy culture system ii bi-plate and tri-plate methods. bi-plate and tri-plate cultures were incubated for 18 to 24h and interpreted by 2 independent, untrained readers within 5h of each other. an experienced technician completed the standard laboratory culture. for each sample, all 3 study personnel recorded the culture result (yes/no) for each of the following diagnostic categories: no bacterial growth (ng), mixed (2 organisms), contaminated (3 or more organisms), gram-positive (gp), gram-negative (gn), staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and other. for each category, the prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values of a positive and negative test were calculated, and the agreement between readers and between each reader and the laboratory was assessed. specificity, overall accuracy, and negative predictive values were generally high (>80%) for the bi-plate and tri-plate for each category. sensitivity and positive predictive values were intermediate (>60%) or high (>80%) for the broad categories of ng, gp, gn, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., and for staph. aureus, but were generally lower (<60%) for other more specific categories. similarly, interreader agreement (kappa value) was moderate to substantial (40-80%) for the broad categories of ng, gp, gn, staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., and for staph. aureus and e. coli, but was lower for other categories. the tri-plate had a higher sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value for streptococcus spp., and higher interreader agreement for some of the more specific categories. our conclusion was that bi-plate and tri-plate results will be most reliable when used to classify infections in broad diagnostic categories such ng, gp, or gn. the bi-plate and tri-plate will have intermediate ability to identify infections as being caused by staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., or staph. aureus.

TI  == antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
AB  == this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.

TI  == investigation of the antimicrobial activity of bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail powdered infant milk formulae.
AB  == this study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of ten bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail infant milk formulae against a range of indicator (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus bulgaricus and listeria innocua)  and clinically relevant (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli) microorganisms. deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all b. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive target organisms.  pcr and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the b. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. the remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. further analyses identified a peptide of ~1,422 da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. n-terminal sequencing of the ~1,422 da peptide from one strain identified it as ilpeitxifhd. this peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by bacillus spp. subsequent pcr analyses demonstrated that the six b. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar  to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that  the ~1,422 da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.

TI  == sepsis from the gut: the enteric habitat of bacteria that cause late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: late-onset sepsis is a major problem in neonatology, but the habitat  of the pathogens before bloodstream invasion occurs is not well established. methods: we examined prospectively collected stools from premature infants with sepsis to find pathogens that subsequently invaded their bloodstreams, and sought the same organisms in stools of infants without sepsis. culture-based techniques  were used to isolate stool bacteria that provisionally matched the bloodstream organisms, which were then genome sequenced to confirm or refute commonality. results: of 11 children with late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections, 7 produced at least 1 stool that contained group b streptococcus (gbs), serratia marcescens, or escherichia coli before their sepsis episode with provisionally matching organisms. of 96 overlap comparison subjects without sepsis temporally associated with these cases, 4 were colonized with provisionally matching gbs or  s. marcescens. of 175 comparisons of stools from randomly selected infants without sepsis, 1 contained a gbs (this infant had also served as an overlap comparison subject and both specimens contained provisionally matching gbs). genome sequencing confirmed common origin of provisionally matching fecal and blood isolates. the invasive e. coli were present in all presepticemic stools since birth, but gut colonization with gbs and s. marcescens occurred closer to time of bloodstream infection. conclusions: the neonatal gut harbors sepsis-causing pathogens, but such organisms are not inevitable members of the normal microbiota. surveillance microbiology, decolonization, and augmented hygiene might prevent dissemination of invasive bacteria between and within premature infants.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates collected from complicated skin and skin structure infections and intra-abdominal infections in africa and middle east countries: test 2007-2012.
AB  == complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and intra-abdominal infections (iais) are problematic due to decreasing therapeutic options available against multidrug-resistant pathogens common among these types of infections. a total of 2245 isolates from african and the middle eastern (afme) countries were  collected to determine in vitro activity for tigecycline and comparators during 2007-2012 as part of the tigecycline evaluation surveillance trial program. tigecycline was launched in the afme in 2007 and remains active against a wide range of targeted pathogens worldwide. isolates were recovered from csssi (1990)  and iai (255) from 38 sites in 11 afme countries. staphylococcus aureus was the most common species from csssi (27.9%), and the methicillin-resistant s. aureus rate was 25%. enterococcus spp. (7.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (2.9%) were other common gram-positive pathogens represented. enterobacter spp. (14.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), escherichia coli (11.4%), klebsiella spp. (10.9%), and acinetobacter spp. (7.2 %) were the most common gram-negative species collected. tigecycline mic(90) values were 0.25 mug/ml against s. aureus. e. coli and enterobacter spp. had tigecycline mic(90) values of 1 and 2 mug/ml, respectively. e. coli was the most frequently collected species from iai (28.3%), followed by klebsiella spp. (20.8%), enterococcus spp. (11.8%), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.3%). isolates collected from iai had the following tigecycline mic(90) values: e. coli (1 mug/ml), klebsiella spp. and other enterobacteriaceae (2 mug/ml), enterococcus spp. (0.25 mug/ml), and s. maltophilia (1 mug/ml). tigecycline in vitro activity was observed against a broad spectrum of bacterial species, including strains resistant to other antimicrobial classes.

TI  == evaluation of the effects of ultraviolet light on bacterial contaminants inoculated into whole milk and colostrum, and on colostrum immunoglobulin g.
AB  == raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. according to the usda, more than 58% of calves in the united states are fed unpasteurized milk. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of uv light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum igg. a pilot-scale uv light continuous (uvc) flow-through unit (45 j/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with listeria innocua, mycobacterium smegmatis, salmonella serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with uvc. during uvc treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. the effect of uvc on igg was  evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. for each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and igg was measured using elisa. the uvc treatment of milk resulted  in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction of listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml reduction), and a. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction for m. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment  of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/ml) of listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), but not of e. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the igg concentration, with an observed final mean igg reduction of approximately 50%. development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to igg  caused by manipulating colostrum.

TI  == trends in bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal meningitis in england and wales 2004-11: an observational study.
AB  == background: meningitis remains one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, yet there are few population-based studies on the epidemiology, causes, or trends over time in meningitis, especially in industrialised countries. our aim was to do such a study using routinely reported data available in england and wales. methods: in england and wales, uk national health service hospitals routinely report laboratory-confirmed pathogens electronically to public health england. records of all positive bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal results from cerebrospinal fluid or from blood cultures in patients with clinical meningitis were extracted for analysis. the percentage change in annual  incidence was estimated using linear regression analysis of the log of the annual incidence. findings: during 2004-11, 7061 cases of meningitis were reported (mean annual incidence 1.62 per 100,000 people, 95% ci 1.58-1.66), including 2594 cases in children (37%). the incidence of bacterial (1.44 per 100,000 people, 1.41-1.48), fungal (0.09, 0.08-0.10), and mycobacterial (0.09, 0.08-0.09) meningitis remained stable overall and across the age groups, apart from significant year-on-year increases in children younger than 3 months (978 cases;  incidence 72.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 7.4%, 5.1-9.8; p<0.0001) driven mainly by group b streptococci (gbs), and in adults aged 65 years or older (752 cases; incidence 1.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 3.0%, 1.4-4.8; p<0.0001) primarily because of escherichia coli. by contrast, meningococcal meningitis rates declined steadily, but remained the most common cause of meningitis in children. overall, five groups of bacteria accounted for 60% (3790/6286) of bacterial meningitis cases: neisseria meningitidis (1350 cases, 22%), streptococcus pneumoniae (1143, 18%), staphylococcus aureus (652, 10%), gbs (326, 5%), and e coli (319, 5%). interpretation: in england and wales, laboratory-based surveillance shows a remarkably stable incidence of bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial meningitis in recent years, although there were differences in individual trends among the main pathogens causing meningitis in different age groups. funding: none.

TI  == the microbiology of bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis in children.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiology of secondary bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis and the appropriateness of current antimicrobial practice in one institution. methods: a 14-year retrospective single-centre study of 69 consecutive paediatric patients (age 1-14 years) with appendicitis-related peritonitis and positive peritoneal specimen cultures was conducted. post-operative outcomes, microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of peritoneal isolates were analysed in all patients. results: escherichia coli was  identified in 56/69 (81 %) peritoneal specimens; four isolates were resistant to  amoxicillin-clavulanate, and one other isolate was resistant to gentamicin. anaerobes were identified in 37/69 (54 %) peritoneal specimens; two anaerobic isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and one isolate was resistant  to metronidazole. pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 4/69 (6 %) peritoneal  specimens, and all were susceptible to gentamicin. streptococcal species (two group f streptococci and three beta-haemolytic streptococci) were identified in 5/69 (7 %) specimens, and all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate. combination therapy involving amoxicillin-clavulanate and aminoglycoside is appropriate empirical treatment in 68/69 (99 %) patients. addition of metronidazole to this regime would provide 100 % initial empirical coverage. inadequate initial empiric antibiotic treatment and the presence of amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant e. coli were independent predictors of the post-operative infectious complications observed in 14/69 (20 %) patients. conclusion: e. coli and mixed anaerobes are the predominant organisms identified  in secondary peritonitis from appendicitis in children. inadequate initial empirical antibiotic and amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant e. coli may contribute to increased post-operative infectious complications. this study provides evidence-based information on choice of combination therapy for paediatric appendicitis-related bacterial peritonitis.

AB  == background: the cause of acute uncomplicated cystitis is determined on the basis  of cultures of voided midstream urine, but few data guide the interpretation of such results, especially when gram-positive bacteria grow. methods: women from 18 to 49 years of age with symptoms of cystitis provided specimens of midstream urine, after which we collected urine by means of a urethral catheter for culture (catheter urine). we compared microbial species and colony counts in the paired specimens. the primary outcome was a comparison of positive predictive values and negative predictive values of organisms grown in midstream urine, with the presence or absence of the organism in catheter urine used as the reference. results: the analysis of 236 episodes of cystitis in 226 women yielded 202 paired specimens of midstream urine and catheter urine that could be evaluated. cultures were positive for uropathogens in 142 catheter specimens (70%), 4 of which had more than one uropathogen, and in 157 midstream specimens (78%). the presence of  escherichia coli in midstream urine was highly predictive of bladder bacteriuria  even at very low counts, with a positive predictive value of 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter of 93% (spearman's r=0.944). in contrast, in midstream urine, enterococci (in 10% of cultures) and group b streptococci (in 12% of cultures) were not predictive of bladder bacteriuria at any colony count (spearman's r=0.322 for enterococci and 0.272 for group b streptococci). among 41 episodes in which enterococcus, group b streptococci, or both were found in midstream urine, e. coli grew from catheter urine cultures in 61%. conclusions: cultures of voided midstream urine in healthy premenopausal women with acute uncomplicated cystitis accurately showed evidence of bladder e. coli but not of enterococci or group b streptococci, which are often isolated with e. coli but appear to rarely cause cystitis by themselves.

TI  == neonatal sepsis: an old problem with new insights.
AB  == neonatal sepsis continues to be a common and significant health care burden, especially in very-low-birth-weight infants (vlbw<1500 g). though intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of early-onset group b streptococcal infection dramatically, it still remains a major cause of neonatal  sepsis. moreover, some studies among vlbw preterm infants have shown an increase  in early-onset sepsis caused by escherichia coli. as the signs and symptoms of neonatal sepsis are nonspecific, early diagnosis and prompt treatment remains a challenge. there have been a myriad of studies on various diagnostic markers like hematological indices, acute phase reactants, c-reactive protein, procalcitonin,  cytokines, and cell surface markers among others. nonetheless, further research is needed to identify a biomarker with high diagnostic accuracy and validity. some of the newer markers like inter alpha inhibitor proteins have shown promising results thereby potentially aiding in early detection of neonates with  sepsis. in order to decrease the widespread, prolonged use of unnecessary antibiotics and improve the outcome of the infants with sepsis, reliable identification of sepsis at an earlier stage is paramount.

TI  == bacteria detected after instrumentation surgery for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis in a canine model.
AB  == objective: this study was designed to identify the presence, type and origin of bacteria adjacent to the metal implant in the infected region in a canine model of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis treated with single-stage anterior autogenous bone grafting and instrumentation. methods: dogs with pyogenic spondylodiscitis underwent one-stage debridement, autogenous bone grafting and titanium plate instrumentation and perioperative antibiotic therapy. the implants and adjacent vertebral bones were removed surgically at various postoperative time points (4,  8, 12 and 24 weeks) for bacteria detection. bacteria were detected from retrieved spinal implants as well as surrounding bones by culture and/or pyrosequencing methods in 17 (85%) of all 20 animals. the positive rate for bacteria presence was 45% by culture and 80% by pyrosequencing method. results: radiological or macroscopic examination showed no signs for infection recurrence in any animal regardless of bacteria presence at the surgical site. however, organism identical with the causative bacterium for spinal infection was found in only two of nine culture-positive animals. conclusion: within the confines of the study, the use of metallic implants in an infected area did not lead to a clinically relevant infection although bacteria may exist at the surgical site. the use of metallic implants in an infected area of the spine is safe. the metallic implants may not  be the "culprit" for the persistence or recurrence of infection.

TI  == antibiotic use during pregnancy alters the commensal vaginal microbiota.
AB  == antibiotics may induce alterations in the commensal microbiota of the birth canal in pregnant women. therefore, we studied the effect of antibiotic administration  during pregnancy on commensal vaginal bacterial colonization at gestational week  36. six hundred and sixty-eight pregnant women from the novel unselected copenhagen prospective studies on asthma in childhood (copsac2010 ) pregnancy cohort participated in this analysis. detailed information on oral antibiotic prescriptions during pregnancy filled at the pharmacy was obtained and verified prospectively. vaginal samples were obtained at pregnancy week 36 and cultured for bacteria. women who received oral antibiotics during any pregnancy trimester  had an increased rate of colonization by staphylococcus species in the vaginal samples as compared with samples obtained from women without any antibiotic treatment during pregnancy (adjusted or 1.63, 95% ci 1.06-2.52, p 0.028). oral antibiotic administration in the third trimester were also associated with increased colonization by staphylococcus species (adjusted or 1.98, 95% ci 1.04-3.76, p 0.037). these bacteriological changes were associated with urinary tract infection antibiotics. women treated in the third trimester of pregnancy were more often colonized by escherichia coli than women without antibiotic treatment in the third trimester (adjusted or 1.91, 95% ci 1.04-3.52, p 0.038). this change was associated with respiratory tract infection (rti) antibiotics. we did not observe any significant changes in vaginal streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptoccocus) or staphylococcus aureus colonization following antibiotic treatment in pregnancy. antibiotic administration during pregnancy leads to alterations in the vaginal microbiological ecology prior to birth, with  potential morbidity, and long-term effects on the early microbial colonization of the neonate.

TI  == in vitro characterization of plysk1249, a novel phage lysin, and assessment of its antibacterial activity in a mouse model of streptococcus agalactiae bacteremia.
AB  == beta-hemolytic streptococcus agalactiae is the leading cause of bacteremia and invasive infections. these diseases are treated with beta-lactams or macrolides,  but the emergence of less susceptible and even fully resistant strains is a cause for concern. new bacteriophage lysins could be promising alternatives against such organisms. they hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage cycle, in order to release the phage progeny. by using a bioinformatic approach to screen several beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gene coding for a lysin was identified on a prophage carried by streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis sk1249. the gene product, named plysk1249, harbored an original three-domain structure with a central cell wall-binding domain surrounded by an n-terminal amidase and a c-terminal chap domain. purified plysk1249 was highly lytic and bactericidal for s. dysgalactiae (2-log10 cfu/ml decrease within 15 min). moreover, it also efficiently killed s. agalactiae (1.5-log10 cfu/ml decrease within 15 min) but not several streptococcal commensal species. we further investigated the activity of plysk1249 in a mouse model of s. agalactiae  bacteremia. eighty percent of the animals (n = 10) challenged intraperitoneally with 10(6) cfu of s. agalactiae died within 72 h, whereas repeated injections of  plysk1249 (45 mg/kg 3 times within 24 h) significantly protected the mice (p < 0.01). thus, plysk1249, which was isolated from s. dysgalactiae, demonstrated high cross-lytic activity against s. agalactiae both in vitro and in vivo. these  encouraging results indicated that plysk1249 might represent a good candidate to  be developed as a new enzybiotic for the treatment of systemic s. agalactiae infections.

TI  == new non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  == hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. world health organization (who) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. in this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. the new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (pca) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (cs) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus  (mr s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant s. epidermidis (mdr s. epidermidis), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, candida albicans and three clinical isolates: mr s. aureus, mdr s. epidermidis, and an e. coli strain. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics),  minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices were evaluated. ethanol 70% v/v, isopropanol 60% v/v, and 4% w/v chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. copper sulphate pentahydrate  was very effective against all tested microorganisms: the mic and mbc for cs ranged from 781 mg/l against s. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against e. coli strains and c. albicans. in addition, pca exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. the combination of cs and pca  showed a strong synergistic effect and all fic indices were </=0.500. the combination of cs and pca were more effective than ethanol 70% v/v and isopropanol 60% v/v. in addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. this work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == improved protease stability of the antimicrobial peptide pin2 substituted with d-amino acids.
AB  == cationic antimicrobial peptides (amps) have attracted a great interest as novel class of antibiotics that might help in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. however, some amps with high antimicrobial activities are also highly hemolytic and subject to proteolytic degradation from  human and bacterial proteases that limit their pharmaceutical uses. in this work  a d-diastereomer of pandinin 2, d-pin2, was constructed to observe if it maintained antimicrobial activity in the same range as the parental one, but with the purpose of reducing its hemolytic activity to human erythrocytes and improving its ability to resist proteolytic cleavage. although, the hydrophobic and secondary structure characteristics of l- and d-pin2 were to some extent similar, an important reduction in d-pin2 hemolytic activity (30-40 %) was achieved compared to that of l-pin2 over human erythrocytes. furthermore, d-pin2  had an antimicrobial activity with a mic value of 12.5 mum towards staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and two strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa in agar diffusion assays, but it was half less potent than that of l-pin2. nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of d-pin2 was equally effective  as that of l-pin2 in microdilution assays. yet, when d- and l-pin2 were incubated with trypsin, elastase and whole human serum, only d-pin2 kept its antimicrobial  activity towards all bacteria, but in diluted human serum, l- and d-pin2 maintained similar peptide stability. finally, when l- and d-pin2 were incubated  with proteases from p. aeruginosa dfu3 culture, a clinical isolated strain, d-pin2 kept its antibiotic activity while l-pin2 was not effective.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 secreted in the milk of transgenic goats produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer.
AB  == the present study was conducted to determine whether recombinant human beta-defensin-3 (rhbd3) in the milk of transgenic goats has an anti-bacterial activity against escherichia coli (e. coli), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and streptococcus agalactiae (s. agalactiae) that could cause mastitis. a hbd3 mammary-specific expression vector was transfected by electroporation into goat fetal fibroblasts which were used to produce fourteen healthy transgenic goats by somatic cell nuclear transfer. the expression level of rhbd3 in the milk of the six transgenic goats ranged from 98 to 121 microg/ml at 15 days of lactation, and was maintained at 90-111 microg/ml during the following 2 months. milk samples from transgenic goats showed an obvious inhibitory activity against e. coli, s. aureus and s. agalactiae in vitro. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of rhbd3 in milk against e. coli, s. aureus and s. agalactiae were 9.5-10.5, 21.8-23.0 and 17.3-18.5 microg/ml, respectively, which was similar to those of the hbd3 standard (p>0.05). the in vivo anti-bacterial activities of rhbd3 in milk were examined by intramammary infusion of viable bacterial inoculums. we observed that 9/10 and 8/10 glands of non-transgenic goats infused with s. aureus and e. coli became infected. the mean numbers of viable bacteria went up to 2.9x10(3) and 95.4x10(3) cfu/ml at 48 h after infusion, respectively; the mean somatic cell counts (scc) in infected glands reached up to 260.4x10(5) and 622.2x10(5) cells/ml, which were significantly higher than the scc in uninfected goat glands. in contrast, no bacteria was presented in glands of transgenic goats and pbs-infused controls, and the ssc did not significantly change throughout the period. moreover, the compositions and protein profiles of milk from transgenic and non-transgenic goats were identical. the present study demonstrated that hbd3 were an effective anti-bacterial protein to enhance the mastitis resistance of dairy animals.

TI  == comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  == the objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the milk analysis laboratory (l.i.g.a.l.) at galicia, spain from june 2005 to september 2011. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. the decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in imi caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. the obtained results reflect a  greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional  classification into contagious or environmental. staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, strep. uberis showed a different behavior to escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) species and streptococcus other than strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples  submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.

TI  == pathogen profile of clinical mastitis in irish milk-recording herds reveals a complex aetiology.
AB  == effective mastitis control requires knowledge of the predominant pathogen challenges on the farm. in order to quantify this challenge, the aetiological agents associated with clinical mastitis in 30 milk-recording dairy herds in ireland over a complete lactation were investigated. standard bacteriology was performed on 630 pretreatment quarter milk samples, of which 56 per cent were culture-positive, 42 per cent culture-negative and 2 per cent contaminated. two micro-organisms were isolated from almost 5 per cent of the culture-positive samples. the bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus (23 per cent), streptococcus uberis (17 per cent), escherichia coli (9 per cent), streptococcus  species (6 per cent), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4 per cent) and other species (1 per cent). a wide variety of bacterial species were associated with clinical mastitis, with s aureus the most prevalent pathogen overall, followed by s uberis. however, the bacterial challenges varied widely from farm to farm. in comparison with previous reports, in the present study, the contagious pathogens  s aureus and streptococcus agalactiae were less commonly associated with clinical mastitis, whereas, the environmental pathogens s uberis and e coli were found more commonly associated with clinical mastitis. while s aureus remains the pathogen most commonly associated with intramammary infection in these herds, environmental pathogens, such as s uberis and e coli also present a considerable  challenge.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == adaptive response of group b streptococcus to high glucose conditions: new insights on the covrs regulation network.
AB  == although the contribution of carbohydrate catabolism to bacterial colonization and infection is well recognized, the transcriptional changes during these processes are still unknown. in this study, we have performed comparative global  gene expression analysis of gbs in sugar-free versus high glucose milieu. the analysis revealed a differential expression of genes involved in metabolism, transport and host-pathogen interaction. many of them appeared to be among the genes previously reported to be controlled by the covrs two-component system. indeed, the transcription profile of a deltacovrs strain grown in high-glucose conditions was profoundly affected. in particular, of the total genes described to be regulated by glucose, approximately 27% were under covrs control with a functional role in protein synthesis, transport, energy metabolism and regulation. among the covrs dependent genes, we found biba, a recently characterized adhesin involved in bacterial serum resistance and here reported to be down-regulated by glucose. chip analysis revealed that in the presence of glucose, covr binds biba promoter in vivo, suggesting that covr may act as a negative regulator or a repressor. we also demonstrated that, as for other target promoters, chemical phosphorylation of covr in aspartic acid increases its affinity for the biba promoter region. the data reported in this study contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms modulating the adaptation of gbs to glucose.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in ouagadougou, burkina faso.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending saint camille medical centre in ouagadougou. methods: from january 2008 to december 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. results: the results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. candida albicans (48.76%), followed by escherichia coli (16.67%), streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. the antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. however, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. conclusions: the results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. efforts should be made to address these points in the country.

TI  == characterization of the sialic acid synthase from aliivibrio salmonicida suggests a novel pathway for bacterial synthesis of 7-o-acetylated sialic acids.
AB  == resolving the enzymatic pathways leading to sialic acids (sias) in bacteria are vitally important for understanding their roles in pathogenesis and for subsequent development of tools to combat infections. a detailed characterization of the involved enzymes is also essential due to the highly applicable properties of sias, i.e., as used in a wide range of medical applications and human nutrition. bacterial strains that produce sias display them mainly on their cell  surface to mimic animal cells thereby evading the host's immune system. despite several studies, little is known about the virulence mechanisms of the fish pathogen aliivibrio salmonicida. the genome of a. salmonicida lfi1238 contains a  gene cluster homologous to the escherichia coli neuraminic acid (neu) gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of sias found in the e. coli capsule. this cluster is probably responsible for the biosynthesis of neu found in a. salmonicida. in this work, we have produced and characterized the sialic acid (sia) synthase neub1, the key enzyme in the pathway. the sia synthase is an enzyme producing n-acetylneuraminic acid by the condensation of n-acetylmannosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate. genome content, kinetic data obtained, together with structural considerations, have led us to the prediction  that the substrate for neub1 from a. salmonicida, e. coli and streptococcus agalactiae among others, is 4-o-acetyl-n-acetylmannosamine. this means that the product of its enzymatic reaction is 7-o-acetyl-n-acetylneuraminic acid. we propose a pathway for production of this sia in a. salmonicida, and present evidence for the presence of diacetylated neu in the bacterium.

TI  == comparative microbial analysis of paired amniotic fluid and cord blood from pregnancies complicated by preterm birth and early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: 16s rrna-based genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases. many cases which were recognized as "idiopathic" are now  known to have an infectious etiology. here, we present a proof-of-concept study to examine the microbial link between intra-amniotic infection (iai) and early-onset neonatal sepsis (eons). results: using culture independent methods, we analyzed paired amniotic fluid (af) and cord blood (cb) samples from 36 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (ptb), iai, and/or eons. ptb cases were grouped as 1) group 1- neonatal blood culture-positive eons (n=6). 2)  group 2- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with positive iai (n=16).  3) group 3- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with no iai (n=7); 4) group 4- no eons or iai (n=7). in addition, samples from term healthy deliveries  (n=8) served as technical controls. a total of 31 species (15 non-redundant) were identified in af, of which only 1/3 were cultivated. significantly fewer microorganisms were detected in cb, with a total of 18 species (7 non-redundant)  identified, of which only 2 (escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae) were cultivated. of those, bergeyella, fusobacterium nucleatum, and sneathia sanguinegens had not been detected in eons before. the novel species identified in af by pcr include peptoniphilus harei and lachnospiraceae sp. the majority (72%) of cb species were also detected in the matching af, with e. coli and f. nucleatum as the most prevalent. the 16s rrna sequences of paired af and cb were  99.9-100% identical, while no identical sequences were found between different pregnancies. conclusions: previously unrecognized, uncultivated or difficult-to-cultivate species are implicated in eons. microbial species in paired af and cb likely share the same infectious origin. given its prevalence in eons, f. nucleatum should be placed on the same importance scale as e. coli.

TI  == donor-derived bacteremia in liver transplant recipients despite antibiotic prophylaxis.
AB  == as the disparity between the number of candidates listed for transplant and the number of donors continues to grow, marginal organ donors are increasingly utilized. this includes bacteremic donors which may carry an increased risk of transmission of infection. it is recommended that recipients of organs from bacteremic donors receive antibiotic prophylaxis based on the susceptibilities of the donor isolate to prevent transmission. here, we present four cases of donor-derived bacteremia, despite appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis, in four  liver transplant recipients. transmitted pathogens included staphylococcus aureus in two cases, and escherichia coli and group b streptococcus each in one case. interestingly, none of the nonhepatic organs (n=10) utilized from these bacteremic donors resulted in transmissions. these cases highlight the fact that  risk of transmission from bacteremic donors is not eliminated with antimicrobial  therapy in the donor and recipient. as no transmissions occurred in recipients of nonhepatic organs from these donors, these cases also suggest that liver recipients may be at higher risk of donor transmitted bacteremia.

TI  == comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees c and -20 degrees c on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen (n) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen. an effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the south african national milk recording scheme  (nmrs) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/ml milk. the organisation responsible for sample collection of the nmrs milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. this existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. an additional sampling was performed at week 30 for  samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees c. freezing and cryopreservation did  not impair subsequent isolation of streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus (sth) (phage type lytic group iii) or sta. aureus (sta) (phage typed, other than lytic group iii). survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. the survival of streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in south african dairy herds.

TI  == recent developments and current issues in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of bacterial and fungal neonatal sepsis.
AB  == identifying neonates with sepsis is complicated by variability in clinical presentation. the incidence of early onset sepsis (eos) resulting from invasive group b streptococcal (gbs) infections has been notably reduced by the widespread delivery of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. rates of eos attributable to non-gbs etiologies have remained constant, and ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli has become more prevalent. late-onset sepsis (los) attributable to gram-positive organisms including coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among  premature infants. invasive candidiasis is an emerging cause of los, especially among infants who receive broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. prophylactic fluconazole administration to very low-birth-weight (vlbw) neonates during the first 6 weeks of life prevents invasive candidiasis in neonatal intensive care units (nicu) with high rates of fungal infections. targeted fluconazole prophylaxis may be beneficial in vlbw neonates who receive care in nicus with lower rates of invasive fungal infections. assessment of immune function, neutrophil markers, acute phase reactants, and utilization of sepsis screening scores may contribute to the management of sepsis. maternal decolonization, antimicrobial stewardship, early enteral feeding, and optimal infection control practices are potential practical strategies for reducing the burden of neonatal  sepsis.

AB  == objectives: to identify trends in early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis neonatal rates and to evaluate the appropriateness of the empirical antibiotic protocols. design: a 17-yr (1993-2009) analysis of positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. setting: the two neonatal icus at the hadassah- hebrew university medical center. results: during this period, 991 infants had at least one episode of either bacteremia or meningitis. the overall incidence of early-onset sepsis was 0.64 per 1,000 live births with a nonsignificant trend over the study period (p = 0.37). the overall incidence of late-onset sepsis was  7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the incidence rates (p = 0.021). the incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the prevalence rates (p = 0.021). the prevalence of early-onset group b streptococcus bacteremia decreased significantly throughout the study period. among late-onset sepsis, gram-positive and fungi infection rates were stable over time, while gram-negative infection rates showed a significant positive trend (p = 0.007). no significant change in the susceptibility rate of the isolated gram-negative bacteria in late-onset sepsis for the common antibacterial drugs was found. about 85% and 90% of the isolated organisms were susceptible to our early-onset sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin)  and late-onset sepsis (vancomycin and cefotaxime) protocols, respectively, and these rates were stable over the study period (p = .1 and .55, respectively). sepsis-related mortality was higher among gram- negative sepsis cases resistant to our empiric antibiotic protocol. conclusions: our empiric antibiotic protocols are appropriate despite their continuous use over the last 17 yrs. this may have  been achieved by the use of a controlled antibiotic program and infection control efforts.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == immune modulation by group b streptococcus influences host susceptibility to urinary tract infection by uropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is most often caused by uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec). upec inoculation into the female urinary tract (ut) can occur through physical activities that expose the ut to an inherently polymicrobial periurethral, vaginal, or gastrointestinal flora. we report that a common urogenital inhabitant and opportunistic pathogen, group b streptococcus (gbs), when present at the time of upec exposure, undergoes rapid upec-dependent exclusion from the murine urinary tract, yet it influences acute upec-host interactions and alters host susceptibility to persistent outcomes of bladder and kidney infection. gbs presence results in increased upec titers in the bladder lumen during acute infection and reduced inflammatory responses of murine macrophages to live upec or purified lipopolysaccharide (lps), phenotypes that require gbs mimicry of host sialic acid residues. taken together, these studies suggest that despite low titers, the presence of gbs at the time of polymicrobial ut exposure may be an overlooked risk factor for chronic pyelonephritis and recurrent uti in susceptible groups, even if it is outcompeted and thus absent by the time of diagnosis.

AB  == bacteriological culture (bc) is the traditional method for intramammary infection diagnosis but lacks sensitivity and is time consuming. multiplex real-time pcr (mr-pcr) enables testing the presence of several bacteria and reduces diagnosis time. our objective was to estimate bacterial species-specific sensitivity (se) and specificity of both bc and mr-pcr tests for detecting bacteria in milk samples from clinical mastitis cases and from apparently normal quarters, using a bayesian latent class model. milk samples from 1,014 clinical mastitis cases and  1,495 samples from apparently normal quarters were analyzed by bc and mr-pcr. two positive culture definitions were used: >/=1 cfu/0.01 ml and >/=10 cfu/0.01 ml of the specified bacteria. the mr-pcr was designed to simultaneously detect staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus  agalactiae. the priors used in our bayesian model were weakly informative, with bc priors using the best available error data. results were compared with those obtained using uniform priors for mr-pcr to test robustness. weak and uniform priors gave about the same posterior distributions except for strep. uberis from  normal quarters and strep. agalactiae. multiplex real-time pcr se on milk from clinical mastitis were lower than mr-pcr se on milk from normal quarters. multiplex real-time pcr se was higher than bc on milk from normal quarters. multiplex real-time pcr se was generally lower than bc on milk from clinical mastitis and it varied by clinical severity. the estimate specificities of detection for all pathogens were >/=99%, regardless of sample type. the effect of milk sample preservation before testing was evaluated and may have been a factor  that affected our observed results. a significant association was observed between sample age and mr-pcr results leading to reduced detection of e. coli and strep. agalactiae in nonclinical samples. differences in sample age between conduct of bc and of mr-pcr did not concur with any apparent differences between  se estimates of the 2 tests. further work should be done to extend these results  to other pcr-based tests for detecting bacterial species in milk samples, for which presented results could be used as prior parameter distributions. limits of sample handling and storage and the potential existence of substances in clinical case samples that may interfere with pcr reactions also are worth further investigation.

TI  == development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (bm). however, no lamp assay is reported to detect streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of bm. moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube lamp assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the bacteria. the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of main pathogens involved in bm were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific lamp assay primers. we successfully designed a set of broad range specific lamp assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis and s. agalactiae. the broad range lamp assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli. the sensitivity of our lamp assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional pcr assay. the bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the lamp products with restriction endonuclease ddei and haeiii.

TI  == quality of bulk tank milk samples from danish dairy herds based on real-time polymerase chain reaction identification of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == results of a commercial real-time pcr analysis for 11 mastitis pathogens from bulk tank milk (btm) samples from all 4,258 danish dairy herds in november 2009 to january 2010 were compared with somatic cell count (scc) and total bacteria count (tbc) estimates in btm. for streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus uberis, a low real-time pcr cycle threshold (ct)  value (corresponding to high bacterial dna quantity) was correlated with higher scc and higher tbc. for staphylococcus aureus, low ct values were correlated only with higher scc. for the environmental mastitis pathogens klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp., and escherichia coli, low ct values had a correlation with higher tbc. staphylococcus spp. were found in the btm from all herds, strep. uberis in 95%, staph. aureus in 91%, and strep. dysgalactiae in 86%, whereas e. coli, klebsiella, and strep. agalactiae were found in 61, 13, and 7% of the herds. it is concluded that the real-time pcr used provides results that are related to the milk quality in the herds. real-time pcr can be used in the same way as culture for monitoring btm samples, and is especially useful for bacteria  with low prevalence (e.g., strep. agalactiae).

TI  == developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  == vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which  vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. however, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. as such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'reverse vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen  to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to  the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery,  including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate  in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. the process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup b neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. as novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.

TI  == maternal hiv infection and vertical transmission of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: hiv-exposed newborns may be at higher risk of sepsis because of immune system aberrations, impaired maternal antibody transfer and altered exposure to pathogenic bacteria. methods: we performed a secondary analysis of a  study (clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00136370) conducted between april 2004 and october 2007 in south africa. we used propensity score matching to evaluate the association between maternal hiv infection and (1) vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens; (2) vertical transmission of pathogens to the newborn; and (3) sepsis within 3 days of birth (eos) or between 4-28 days of life (los). results: colonization with group b streptococcus (17% vs 23%, p = .0002), escherichia coli (47% vs 45%, p = .374), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7% vs 10%, p  = .008) differed modestly between hiv-infected and uninfected women, as did vertical transmission rates. maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of neonatal eos or los, although culture-confirmed eos was >3 times higher among hiv-exposed infants (p = .05). when compared with hiv-unexposed, neonates, hiv-exposed, uninfected neonates (heu) had a lower risk  of eos (20.6 vs 33.7 per 1000 births; p = .046) and similar rate of los (5.8 vs 4.1; p = .563). hiv-infected newborns had a higher risk than heu of eos (134 vs 21.5; p < .0001) and los (26.8 vs 5.6; p = .042). conclusions: maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of maternal bacterial colonization, vertical transmission, eos, or los. hiv-infected neonates, however, were at increased risk of eos and los.

TI  == genome-wide mapping of cystitis due to streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli in mice identifies a unique bladder transcriptome that signifies pathogen-specific antimicrobial defense against urinary tract infection.
AB  == the most common causes of urinary tract infections (utis) are gram-negative pathogens such as escherichia coli; however, gram-positive organisms, including streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus (gbs), also cause uti. in gbs  infection, uti progresses to cystitis once the bacteria colonize the bladder, but the host responses triggered in the bladder immediately following infection are largely unknown. here, we used genome-wide expression profiling to map the bladder transcriptome of gbs uti in mice infected transurethrally with uropathogenic gbs that was cultured from a 35-year-old women with cystitis. rna from bladders was applied to affymetrix gene-1.0st microarrays; quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (qrt-pcr) was used to analyze selected gene responses identified in array data sets. a surprisingly small significant-gene list of 172  genes was identified at 24 h; this compared to 2,507 genes identified in a side-by-side comparison with uropathogenic e. coli (upec). no genes exhibited significantly altered expression at 2 h in gbs-infected mice according to arrays  despite high bladder bacterial loads at this early time point. the absence of a marked early host response to gbs juxtaposed with broad-based bladder responses activated by upec at 2 h. bioinformatics analyses, including integrative system-level network mapping, revealed multiple activated biological pathways in  the gbs bladder transcriptome that regulate leukocyte activation, inflammation, apoptosis, and cytokine-chemokine biosynthesis. these findings define a novel, minimalistic type of bladder host response triggered by gbs uti, which comprises  collective antimicrobial pathways that differ dramatically from those activated by upec. overall, this study emphasizes the unique nature of bladder immune activation mechanisms triggered by distinct uropathogens.

TI  == the impact of group b streptococcus prophylaxis on late-onset neonatal infections.
AB  == objective: to determine trends in late-onset neonatal infections and risk factors for ampicillin/penicillin-resistant microorganisms. study design: data on 584 infants with positive blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid cultures for bacteria or fungi at 8-30 days of age from 1990 to 2007 were examined and divided into three epochs, based on intrapartum antibiotic prophylactic (iap) practices. pathogens and antibiotic resistance were compared among epochs. result: the number of candidal infections increased over time for the entire population (p=0.006). there was an increased incidence of gram-negative (p=0.009) and candidal infections (p=0.014) among very low-birthweight infants. only escherichia coli infections showed increasing ampicillin resistance over epochs (p=0.006). in regression analysis, ampicillin/penicillin resistance increased with iap use (odds ratio 2.05). conclusion: changing microorganisms and increasing antibiotic resistance in late-onset neonatal infections are likely multifactorial but are increased with iap use, which may identify an at-risk population. increasing candida infections require further investigation.

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  == background: vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. the balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe  for humans. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on lactobacilli isolates. materials and methods: in this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to babylon hospital of maternity and paediatrics in babylon province, iraq. the study involved the role of intrauterine device among  married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. this study also involved studying probiotic role of lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. results: results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. the most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. all lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (s. aureus, e. coli). lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. this may be attributed to the production of defense  factors by lactobacilli. conclusion: the types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.

AB  == the major pathogens causing mastitis were evaluated by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) with self-designed primers in four quarters of the first, third, and fifth parities in industrial, semi-industrial, and traditional dairy cattle farms in iran. with the incidence of infection in the quarters by staphylococcus  aureus and streptococcus agalactiae, the mean log somatic cell count (log scc) increased from 5.06 to 5.77. the smallest changes occurred with escherichia coli. contagious pathogens, when compared with environmental pathogens, were more prevalent and common and created more profound quantitative and qualitative changes in scc profiles. the second part of the study surveyed the diversity of contaminating pathogens and their effect on quantitative and qualitative profiles of somatic cells. m-pcr was used to determine the absence (m-pcr(-)) and presence of one (m-pcr(+1)), two (m-pcr(+2)), and three (m-pcr(+3)) major pathogens in raw milk samples. quarter log scc increased from 5.06 (for m-pcr(-1)) to 5.5 (for m-pcr(+1)), 5.7 (for m-pcr(+2)), and 6 (for m-pcr(+3)). percent changes in polymorphonuclears (pmns) were not significant between different quarters and parities but were significant between different farms in terms of pathogen diversity (p < 0.05). therefore, by increasing the number of types of major pathogens involved in subclinical mastitis, scc of udder quarters and the proportion of pmns significantly increased, whereas the proportion of lymphocytes significantly decreased. this subject is very important in increasing the shelf life of dairy products, because pmns are introduced to the enzymatic pools.

TI  == an experimental mixed bacterial infection induced differential secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (il-1beta, tnfalpha) and prommp-9 in human fetal membranes.
AB  == overall, 1-4% of all births in the us are complicated by choriamnionitis. choriamnionitis is a polymicrobial infection most often due to ascending genital  microbes which, in over 65% of positive amniotic fluid cultures, involves two or  more organisms. in this study, we determine the cytokines expression (il-1beta, tnfalpha) and prometalloproteinase activation (prommp-2 and prommp-9) after double o single infection an in vitro model of human fetal membranes. fetal membranes at term were mounted in the transwell culture system and after 24 h of  infection, choriodecidual, and amnion media was collected. il-1beta and tnfalpha  were evaluated by elisa, whereas prommp-9 and prommp-2 were determined by substrate gel zymography. the choriodecidual and amnion compartments actively respond to the infectious process, which induced the secretion of il-1beta, tnfalpha, and prommp-9 after either mixed or single infection. the prommp-2 secretion profile was the same after all experimental conditions. there was no synergy between streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli for inducing the secretion of inflammatory factors or degradative metalloproteinase. in conclusion, these two bacteria could initiate different pathways to induce chorioamnioitis.

TI  == a proposal of interpretive criteria for cefoperazone applicable to bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the correct assessment of mastitis pathogens for their susceptibility/resistance  to cefoperazone is currently hampered by the lack of harmonized test conditions and interpretive criteria. the aim of this study was to provide a proposal for clinical breakpoints of cefoperazone which are applicable to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis from cases of bovine mastitis and better reflect the situation in the bovine udder than breakpoints adopted from human medicine. for this, pharmacological data and clinical efficacy data of the documents submitted for approval of cefoperazone have been revisited. in addition, 1086 bacterial pathogens of the aforementioned  six species/groups collected in germany and in the usa during recent years were tested in parallel for their cefoperazone mics and the zone diameters using a 75  mug disk. subsequently, mics were plotted against zone diameters. based on the pharmacological data, the clinical efficacy and the microbiological data, a proposal was made for veterinary-specific breakpoints which classify members of the aforementioned species/groups as (a) susceptible to cefoperazone when their mic is </= 2 mug/ml and their zone diameters are >/= 27 mm (staphylococci or e. coli) or >/= 21 mm (streptococci), (b) intermediate when their mic is 4 mug/ml and their zone diameters are 22-26 mm (staphylococci or e. coli) or 16-20mm (streptococci), and (c) resistant when their mic is >/= 8 mug/ml and their zone diameters are </= 21 mm (staphylococci or e. coli) or </= 15 mm (streptococci).

TI  == structure of plantaricin locus of lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3 is a strain which is well known on the russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. the strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. l. plantarum 8p-a3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. dna sequence analysis of l. plantarum 8p-a3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins ef and  nc8. the plantaricin locus found in l. plantarum 8p-a3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in l. plantarum j51.

TI  == an in silico model for identification of small rnas in whole bacterial genomes: characterization of antisense rnas in pathogenic escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae strains.
AB  == characterization of small non-coding ribonucleic acids (srna) among the large volume of data generated by high-throughput rna-seq or tiling microarray analyses remains a challenge. thus, there is still a need for accurate in silico prediction methods to identify srnas within a given bacterial species. after years of effort, dedicated software were developed based on comparative genomic analyses or mathematical/statistical models. although these genomic analyses enabled srnas in intergenic regions to be efficiently identified, they all failed to predict antisense srna genes (asrna), i.e. rna genes located on the dna strand complementary to that which encodes the protein. the statistical models enabled any genomic region to be analyzed theorically but not efficiently. we present a new model for in silico identification of srna and asrna candidates within an entire bacterial genome. this model was successfully used to analyze the gram-negative escherichia coli and gram-positive streptococcus agalactiae. in both bacteria, numerous asrnas are transcribed from the complementary strand of genes located in pathogenicity islands, strongly suggesting that these asrnas are regulators of the virulence expression. in particular, we characterized an asrna  that acted as an enhancer-like regulator of the type 1 fimbriae production involved in the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli.

TI  == late-onset neonatal infections: incidences and pathogens in the era of antenatal  antibiotics.
AB  == widespread use of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis has significantly reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal infection (eoni); however, little is known  about the effects of increased maternal exposure to antibiotics on late-onset neonatal infection (loni). this study aims to evaluate loni epidemiology in our region after the application of french recommendations and to determine whether loni-causing organisms and their antibiotic susceptibility are influenced by peripartum antibiotic exposure. we performed a prospective epidemiologic study of 139 confirmed and possible cases of bacterial loni in patients treated with antibiotics for at least 5 days of the 22,458 infants born in our region in the year 2007. the overall incidence of loni caused by all pathogens, group b streptococcus (gbs) and escherichia coli (e. coli) were 6.19, 0.36 and 2.72, respectively, per 1,000 live births. our findings revealed three major types of loni: e. coli-induced urinary tract infection (uti) among term infants, coagulase negative staphylococcus septicemia affecting preterm infants, and gbs infections  with severe clinical presentation. univariable analysis revealed that maternal antibiotic exposure was significantly associated with the risk of amoxicillin-resistant e. coli infection (p = 0.01). postnatal antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased risk of e. coli loni (p = 0.048). this link persisted upon multivariable analysis; however, no additional risk factors were identified for loni caused by antibiotic-resistant e. coli. conclusion: our findings confirm that despite the benefits of antenatal antibiotics, this treatment can increase the risk of antibiotic-resistant cases of loni. national and international surveillance of loni epidemiology is essential to assess benefits and potential negative consequences of perinatal antibiotic exposure.

TI  == microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  == purpose: collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. in order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to  investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents  present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. methods: in a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from january 2009 to october 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. all the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. cultures for common bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. results: the most  frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. in particular, streptococci were  found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (enterococcus faecalis  and escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. u. urealyticum was detected  in 10% and mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). no cases of n. gonorrhoeae were found. conclusions: cervical culture has a low concordance with  endometrial culture. in fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in  the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. these results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.

AB  == food products, such as milk and meat products including cheese, milk powder, fermented milk, sausage, etc. are susceptible to the contamination by pathogenic  and deteriorative bacteria. these bacteria include listeria monocytogens, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., vibrio parahaemolyticus, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas fluorescens, etc. traditional methods for the detection of these microorganisms are laborious and time consuming. therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are needed. in this study, we designed the dna probes and pcr  primers for the detection of aforementioned microorganisms. by using two sets of  multiplex pcr, followed by a chromogenic macroarray system, these organisms in milk or other food products could be simultaneously detected. when the system was used for the inspection of milk or meat homogenate containing 10(0) target cells  per milliliter or gram of the sample, all these bacterial species could be identified after an 8h pre-enrichment step. the system consisting of a multiplex  pcr step followed by macroarray allowed us to detect multiple target bacterial species simultaneously without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis. compared to the commonly used multiplex pcr method, this approach has the additional advantage of detecting more bacterial strains because some bacterial strains generate pcr products with the same molecular sizes which can be differentiated by macroarray but not by electrophoresis.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  == mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. a wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies  level. these include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. the strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and  disease causation. in this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

AB  == zinc oxide nanoparticles (nps) with the size of approximately 100 nm were prepared via a facile biomineralization process in the template of silk fibroin (sf) peptide at room temperature. these zno nps have shown the remarkable behavior of low toxicity to gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli), and eukaryotic cells (mouse l929 fibroblasts). bacteriological testing indicated that zno nps presented a 50% inhibitory effect on streptococcus agalactiae at the concentrations of >100 mm, whereas at the same concentrations, the growth of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were hardly inhibited. on the other hand, a remarkable proliferation of staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli was observed at the concentrations of zno nps <50 mm. moreover, the cytotoxicity test demonstrated that zno nps mineralized with sf peptide possessed a low toxicity to mouse l929 fibroblasts. the sf peptide coated on the surface of zno nps permitted greater adhesion and consequently greater proliferation of mouse l929 fibroblasts. besides, from tem micrographs of the cell ultrastructure, endocytosis of nps into the cytoplasm can be detected and the ultrastructure of the cell underwent few changes. the cell membrane retained integrity, euchromatin dispersed homogenously inside the cytoplasm, the mitochondrial architecture remained intact, and no intracellular vacuoles were observed. high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and selected area electron diffraction patterns of ultrathin cell sections indicated that the crystal structure of nps was not damaged by the organelle or cytoplasm. all these observations indicated that zno nps mineralized with the sf peptide possess good cytocompatibility.

TI  == risk factors associated with short-term post-treatment outcomes of clinical mastitis.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to characterize 60-d outcomes after treatment of mild (abnormal milk) and moderate (abnormal milk and abnormal udder) cases of  clinical mastitis (cm) occurring in a single quarter of cows on wisconsin farms (n=4) and to determine risk factors associated with those outcomes. duplicate milk samples were collected from the affected quarter of each cow for microbiological analysis at the onset of cm (pre) and 21 d later (post). cows were treated only in the affected quarter using an intramammary product containing 125 mg of ceftiofur. bacteriological cure was defined as absence of pathogens in the post sample obtained from the enrolled quarter. recurrence was defined for the cow when cm occurred after the milk-withholding period for the enrolled case of cm. retention in the herd was defined when a cow was retained within the herd for the 60-d follow-up period. somatic cell count reduction (sccr) was defined at the cow level as somatic cell count (scc) below 200,000 cells/ml at the dairy herd improvement association test day occurring between 21  to 55 d post-treatment. the effects of farm, days in milk, parity, severity, microbiological diagnosis at pre, previous milk yield, previous scc, previous occurrence of cm and treatment duration on selected post-treatment outcomes were  assessed using chi-squared analysis and logistic regression. microbiological results at pre were distributed as: escherichia coli (n=14), klebsiella spp. (n=11), enterobacter spp. (n=8), serratia spp. (n=7), other gram-negative species (n=3), streptococcus spp. (n=25), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=4); staphylococcus aureus (n=1); streptococcus agalactiae (n=1), other gram-positive  species (n=9), and culture negative (n=60). treated quarters were more likely to  experience bacteriological cure when the cow experienced cm for the first time in the lactation and when no pathogen was recovered from pre milk samples obtained from the enrolled quarter. parity and bacteriological cure were associated with the probability of recurrence. greater milk yield at previous dairy herd improvement test was the most important predictor for retention within the herd.  when scc before cm was >200,000 cells/ml the probability of having sccr after treatment was decreased. when the case experienced bacteriological cure, the cow  was less likely to experience recurrent cases and was more likely to have sccr below 200,000 cells/ml. post-treatment outcomes, such as recurrence and sccr, are strongly associated with bacteriological cure and, when monitored, can be used to help determine if a treatment has been successful. information about the etiology of cm, history of clinical and subclinical mastitis, and parity are useful to review when making strategic treatment decisions.

AB  == background: sepsis in the first 3 days of life is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants. group b streptococcus (gbs), historically the primary cause of early-onset sepsis (eos), has declined through widespread use of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. we estimated the national burden of invasive eos cases and deaths in the era of gbs prevention. methods: population-based surveillance for invasive eos was conducted in 4 of the centers for disease control and prevention's active bacterial core surveillance sites from 2005 to 2008. we calculated incidence using state and national live birth files. estimates of the national number of cases and deaths were calculated, standardizing by race and gestational age. results: active bacterial core surveillance identified 658 cases of eos; 72 (10.9%) were fatal. overall incidence remained stable during the 3 years (2005: 0.77 cases/1000 live births;  2008: 0.76 cases/1000 live births). gbs ( approximately 38%) was the most commonly reported pathogen followed by escherichia coli ( approximately 24%). black preterm infants had the highest incidence (5.14 cases/1000 live births) and case fatality (24.4%). nonblack term infants had the lowest incidence (0.40 cases/1000 live births) and case fatality (1.6%). the estimated national annual burden of eos was approximately 3320 cases (95% confidence interval [ci]: 3060-3580), including 390 deaths (95% ci: 300-490). among preterm infants, 1570 cases (95% ci: 1400-1770; 47.3% of the overall) and 360 deaths (95% ci: 280-460;  92.3% of the overall) occurred annually. conclusions: the burden of invasive eos  remains substantial in the era of gbs prevention and disproportionately affects preterm and black infants. identification of strategies to prevent preterm births is needed to reduce the neonatal sepsis burden.

TI  == the changing face of early-onset neonatal sepsis after the implementation of a maternal group b streptococcus screening and intrapartum prophylaxis policy--a study in one medical center.
AB  == background: early-onset sepsis (eos) is the major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. maternal group b streptococcus (gbs) screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap) were implemented in our hospital in 2004. our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and changes in pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility. methods: the medical charts of mothers and infants with eos between january 2001 and november 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. eos was defined as sepsis occurring within 72 hours of birth. data were pooled and compared for january 2001 through september 2004 (period 1, without gbs screening) and october 2004 through november 2008 (period 2, with gbs screening and iap). results: the gbs screening rate increased from 10.11% in 2004 to 65% in 2008 and the iap rate increased from 40% in 2004 to 90% in 2008. the most common  eos pathogen in period 1 was gbs (45.4%), which decreased to 20% in period 2 (p=0.081; trend p=0.009). the percentage of eos because of escherichia coli in period 1 was 40.9% but increased to 70% in period 2 (p=0.059). e coli eos increased in extremely low birth weight premature babies weighing 500-1000g from  period 1 to period 2 (p=0.031). the incidence of ampicillin-resistant e coli eos  was relatively high, but no significant change (88.9% vs. 92.9%) after implementation of gbs screening and iap was noted. conclusion: gbs screening plus iap is effective in decreasing the incidence of gbs eos; however, an increase in  eos caused by e coli was noted. monitoring of pathogens causing eos is important  for effective treatment.

TI  == assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  == despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. one key component of better control of this  disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. this study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial dna extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples  to complement traditional microbiological identification. extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. the following species were identified: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and klebsiella spp. (including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae). the detection procedure includes specific genomic dna amplification  by multiplex pcr for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. the specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. the extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. the analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/ml for milk samples spiked with staph. aureus, strep. dysgalactiae, and e. coli, with a tendency for  k. pneumoniae. the detection limit was 500 cfu/ml for strep. uberis and strep. agalactiae. the overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. when the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, dna purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16s sequencing. the  proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated pcr detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.

TI  == early onset neonatal sepsis: the burden of group b streptococcal and e. coli disease continues.
AB  == background: guidelines for prevention of group b streptococcal (gbs) infection have successfully reduced early onset (eo) gbs disease. study results suggest that escherichia coli is an important eo pathogen. objective: to determine eo infection rates, pathogens, morbidity, and mortality in a national network of neonatal centers. methods: infants with eo infection were identified by prospective surveillance at eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development neonatal network centers. infection was defined by positive culture results for blood and cerebrospinal fluid obtained from infants  aged </=72 hours plus treatment with antibiotic therapy for >/=5 days. mother and infant characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were studied. numbers of cases and total live births (lbs) were used to calculate incidence. results: among 396  586 lbs (2006-2009), 389 infants developed eo infection (0.98 cases per 1000 lbs). infection rates increased with decreasing birth weight. gbs (43%, 0.41 per  1000 lbs) and e coli (29%, 0.28 per 1000 lbs) were most frequently isolated. most infants with gbs were term (73%); 81% with e coli were preterm. mothers of 67% of infected term and 58% of infected preterm infants were screened for gbs, and results were positive for 25% of those mothers. only 76% of mothers with gbs colonization received intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. although 77% of infected infants required intensive care, 20% of term infants were treated in the normal newborn nursery. sixteen percent of infected infants died, most commonly with e coli infection (33%). conclusion: in the era of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis to reduce gbs, rates of eo infection have declined but reflect a continued burden of disease. gbs remains the most frequent pathogen in term infants, and e coli the most significant pathogen in preterm infants. missed opportunities for gbs prevention continue. prevention of e coli sepsis, especially among preterm infants, remains a challenge.

TI  == influence of storage and preservation on microbiological quality of silo ovine milk.
AB  == this study was designed to analyze the effects of the storage and preservation conditions on counts of mesophilic, thermoduric, psychotrophic, coliform, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus organisms in silo ovine milk. a total of 910 analytical determinations were conducted from  aliquots of 10 silo ovine milks. the conditions tested were unpreserved and azidiol-preserved milk stored at 4 degrees c, and unpreserved milk stored at -20  degrees c. milk aged 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-collection for refrigerated aliquots, and 7, 15, and 30 d post-collection for frozen aliquots. the factors silo and storage conditions significantly contributed to variation of all microbiological variables, although milk age effect within storage was only significant for mesophilic, psychrotrophic, and coliform bacteria counts. in refrigerated raw milk, mesophile, psychrotroph, and coliform counts significantly increased over 96 h post-collection, whereas the other groups and bacteria species tested maintained their initial concentration. in all cases, azidiol preservation maintained the initial bacterial concentration in raw sheep milk under refrigeration throughout 96 h. thus, azidiol was a suitable preservative for microbiological studies in sheep milk. smallest counts were registered for frozen samples, particularly for coliforms, e. coli, strep. agalactiae and staph. aureus. estimates of mesophilic, thermoduric and psychrotrophic organisms showed  similar values on both azidiol-preserved and frozen milk samples. coliforms and e. coli counts significantly decrease over time after freezing. consequently, freezing at -20 degrees c could also be appropriate for analysis of mesophilic, thermoduric, and psychrotrophic bacterial groups, but not for coliforms or mammary pathogens.

TI  == the effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on staphylococcus aureus dmst 4745.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (lg) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on  s. aureus biofilm formation. attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological  changes of s. aureus dmst 4745 were also made. the results demonstrate that s. agalactiae and b. cereus are more susceptible to lg, citral and geraniol than s.  aureus and e. coli. moreover, they also inhibit s. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. the lg appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.

TI  == udder pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in estonia.
AB  == background: the goal of this study was to estimate the distribution of udder pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in estonia during the years 2007-2009.  methods: the bacteriological findings reported in this study originate from quarter milk samples collected from cows on estonian dairy farms that had clinical or subclinical mastitis. the samples were submitted by local veterinarians to the estonian veterinary and food laboratory during 2007-2009. milk samples were examined by conventional bacteriology. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the disc diffusion test. logistic regression with a random herd effect to control for clustering was used for statistical analysis. results: during the study period, 3058 clinical mastitis samples from 190 farms and 5146 subclinical mastitis samples from 274 farms were  investigated. positive results were found in 57% of the samples (4680 out of 8204), and the proportion did not differ according to year (p > 0.05). the proportion of bacteriologically negative samples was 22.3% and that of mixed growth was 20.6%. streptococcus uberis (str. uberis) was the bacterium isolated most frequently (18.4%) from cases of clinical mastitis, followed by escherichia  coli (e. coli) (15.9%) and streptococcus agalactiae (str. agalactiae) (11.9%). the bacteria that caused subclinical mastitis were mainly staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (20%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (15.4%). the probability of isolating s. aureus from milk samples was significantly higher on  farms that had fewer than 30 cows, when compared with farms that had more than 100 cows (p < 0.005). a significantly higher risk of str. agalactiae infection was found on farms with more than 600 cows (p = 0.034) compared with smaller farms. the proportion of s. aureus and cns isolates that were resistant to penicillin was 61.4% and 38.5%, respectively. among the e. coli isolates, ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline resistance were observed in 24.3%, 15.6% and 13.5%, respectively. conclusions: this study showed that the main pathogens associated with clinical mastitis were str. uberis and e. coli. subclinical mastitis was caused mainly by s. aureus and cns. the number of s. aureus and str. agalactiae isolates depended on herd size. antimicrobial resistance was highly prevalent, especially penicillin resistance in s. aureus and cns.

TI  == development of a rapid pcr assay for screening of maternal colonization by group  b streptococcus and neonatal invasive escherichia coli during labor.
AB  == objective: group b streptococcus (gbs) and escherichiacoli(e. coli) are the leading causes of early-onset neonatal disease (eod). intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of gbs-colonized women decreases vertical transmission and eod due to gbs. nevertheless, no intervention has been developed to reduce the risk of eod related to e. coli. timely and accurate identification of colonized mothers is necessary to implement preventive strategies against neonatal sepsis. to screen for colonization during labor, we developed a real-time pcr assay for the simultaneous detection of gbs and neonatal invasive strains of e. coli. study design: specific dna targets for gbs are publicly available. for neonatal invasive e. coli, we analyzed candidate dna targets by dna hybridization on microarrays of invasive strains isolated from neonatal e. coli sepsis or meningitis (k1 and not k1 'invasive' serotypes). specificity of dna probes was tested against a panel of bacteria and by simulating clinical conditions (spiking vaginal samples from pregnant women). then, the characteristics of the selected probes were evaluated in a pilot study including 200 women in labor. results: prevalence of rectovaginal gbs and of vaginal and cervical e. coliserotype k1 colonization were 16.0, 3.5 and 3.5% by culture and 27, 10 and 8.5% by pcr, respectively. the prevalence of other invasive e. coli in the vagina and in the cervix, detected by pcr, was around 10%. compared to the culture, considered as the gold standard, the sensitivities of the pcrs for the gbs and e. coli k1 were  97 and 71%, respectively. specificities were 86 and 92%, respectively. specificity is difficult to interpret, as a false-positive pcr result may in fact be a false-negative result of the culture. the turnaround time needed for pcr analysis was 2.5 h, compared to a minimum of 48 h for the culture. conclusion: our rapid pcr is reliable in detecting gbs in women in labor. optimization of the pcr for invasive e. coli is needed before its implementation in clinical practice. more efforts to fight against main causes of neonatal sepsis need to be undertaken to prevent this terrible medical complication.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == vaccination with peptide mimotopes produces antibodies recognizing bacterial capsular polysaccharides.
AB  == a phage display peptide library was screened using a panel of antibodies to the capsular polysaccharides of streptococcus agalactiae and neisseria meningitidis.  mimotopes npdhprvptfma (2-8), lipfhkhphhrg (3-2) and eqeiftnitdrv (g3) showing the highest binding capacity and strongest elisa reaction were selected for immunization experiments. these mimotopes were either synthesised as oligodeoxynucleotides for dna immunization or map (multiple antigen peptide) for  peptide immunization. mimotope-dna vaccination, particularly for g3, induced antibodies recognizing a number of target bacteria. this response was seen after  the second boost injection and was significantly enhanced by the 3rd boost injection with a th1-associated profile, which was dominated by igg2a, followed by igg1. mimotope-map immunization also produced strong humoral immune responses  to the bacteria. antibodies from g3 dna immunization reacted with the surface molecules of s. agalactiae, n. meningitidis and escherichia coli k5 shown by indirect immunofluorescence staining, indicating a possible localization to the bacterial capsule. antibodies produced both from dna/map immunization reacted with purified bacterial capsular polysaccharides by elisa and were of high avidity. we have further characterized peptide g3 by a 'tiling path' study to examine the effect of changing individual residues in the peptide in raising antibodies, which showed that the eiftn motif in g3 was important in generating antibodies to several capsulated bacteria. we conclude that mimotope immunization with dna or map potentially induces strong antibody responses against encapsulated bacteria. it is suggested that the antibody targets are polysaccharides, and these antibodies may cross react at least among closely related species of bacteria.

TI  == linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  == purpose: in vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of l. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated.  method: in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and mic determination. the in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the california mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. results: the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the  antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. in the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the california mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. the microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. the effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis conclusion: the results suggest possible therapeutic potential of l. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.

TI  == the treatment and outcome of postmeningitic subdural empyema in infants.
AB  == object: the management of subdural empyema (sde) has been debated in the literature for decades. craniotomy and bur hole drainage have been shown to achieve a favorable outcome. however, there is a lack of comparative data for these modes of management of sde subsequent to meningitis in infants. methods: the authors conducted a retrospective review of 33 infants identified with sde due to meningitis at the department of neurosurgery, chang gung memorial hospital between 2000 and 2006. preoperative clinical presentation, duration of symptoms,  radiological investigations, csf data, and postoperative outcome were analyzed and compared between these 2 surgical groups. results: at diagnosis, there were no differences between the groups in age, weight, degree of consciousness, csf analysis, or duration of fever. the outcome data showed no difference in the number of days until afebrile, number of days of postsurgical antibiotic treatment, neurological outcome, recurrence rate, or complication rate. there was only 1 death in the series. conclusions: subdural empyema due to meningitis in infants is unique with respect to the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of sde. early detection and removal of sde provide a favorable outcome  in both surgical intervention groups. bur hole drainage is less invasive, and it  is possible to expect a clinical outcome as good as with craniotomy in postmeningitic sde.

TI  == inter-alpha inhibitor protein administration improves survival from neonatal sepsis in mice.
AB  == inter-alpha inhibitor proteins (iaip) are serine proteases inhibitors that modulate endogenous protease activity and have been shown to improve survival in  adult models of sepsis. we evaluated the effect of iaip on survival and systemic  responses to sepsis in neonatal mice. sepsis was induced in 2-d-old mice with lipopolysaccharide (lps), escherichia coli, and group b streptococci. sepsis was  associated with 75% mortality. iaip, given by i.p. administration at doses between 15 and 45 mg/kg from 1 to 6 h after the onset of sepsis, improved survival to approximately 90% (p = 0.0159) in both lps-induced sepsis and with live bacterial infections. the greatest effect was on reversal of hemorrhagic pneumonitis. the effects were dose and time dependent. systemic cytokine profile  and tissue histology were examined. survival was compared in il-10 knock out animals. systemic cytokine levels including tnf-[alpha] and il-10 were increased  after induction of sepsis and modulated significantly after iaip administration.  because the effect of iaip was still demonstrable in il-10 deficient mice, we conclude the beneficial effects of iaip is because of suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-[alpha] rather than augmentation of il-10.  iaip may offer significant benefits as a therapeutic

TI  == bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  == aim: to analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (bm). background: cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. despite its high mortality rate, bm has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. study: bm patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and  2008, were studied. bm was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (csf) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in csf. results: we identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had bm. the mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. the sensitivity of csf culture was 75%  (streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; staphylococcus aureus, 2; listeria monocytogenes, 1; group b streptococcus, 1; streptococcus agalactiae, 1; streptococcus bovis, 1; and escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. five patients died. on admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dl. a  serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl was associated with increased mortality (p=0.028). the model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dl, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus,  and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of csf were not associated with mortality. conclusions: bm in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. the clinical and microbiologic features of bm in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. a serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.

TI  == microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of  these voice prostheses. over a 5-year period, implantation of a provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. in total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. the most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was c. albicans, followed by c. krusei and c. tropicalis. the most frequently isolated bacteria included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus agalactiae. simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. the mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. the longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. there is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the  device life time.

TI  == antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity-independent bactericidal activity of an igg against pseudomonas aeruginosa o6ad.
AB  == in addition to ag recognition, some abs are capable of killing target organisms in the absence of phagocytes and complement. in this study, we report that an anti-pseudomonas aeruginosa o6ad lps igg(1), tobacco-expressed human s20 igg(1) (te-hs20), as well as its recombinant fab and single-chain variable fragment (scfv) fragments have cellular- and complement-independent bactericidal activity. te-hs20 and its fab and scfv significantly reduced viability of p. aeruginosa o6ad in dose- and time-dependent manners in vitro and also showed lower levels of bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa pao1, but had no activity against p.  aeruginosa o10, escherichia coli tg1, and streptococcus agalactiae. the h chain and its fd fragment both had significant ag-binding and bactericidal activities against p. aeruginosa o6ad. bactericidal activity was completely inhibited with specific lps ag, suggesting that ag binding is involved in the bactericidal mechanism. live/dead cell staining and electron microscopic observations indicate that the bactericidal effect was due to disruption of the cell wall and suggest inhibition of cell division. in addition to te-hs20, the fab and scfv were also protective in vivo, as leukopenic mice had prolonged and improved survival after  administration of these ab fragments followed by challenge with p. aeruginosa o6ad cells at 80-90% lethal dose, supporting a bactericidal mechanism independent of phagocytes and complement. understanding of the bactericidal mechanism will allow assessment of the potential for therapeutic application of these abs.

TI  == mechanisms of meningeal invasion by a bacterial extracellular pathogen, the example of neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (csf) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. a few bacterial pathogens are  able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans,  a rare but dreadful disease. surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae). the particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate  immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-csf barrier. in vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, e. coli  and s. agalactiae to reach the csf. n. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type iv pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. recent work has shown that n. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex  par3/par6/apkc that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.

TI  == cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with a history of preterm birth.
AB  == preterm birth is associated with elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnfalpha at the maternal-fetal interface. previous studies have suggested that women with a history of preterm birth produce aberrantly strong inflammatory responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). however many intrauterine infections in women are associated with pathogens including ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae (group b  streptococcus) that contain pro-inflammatory factors other than lps. we evaluated whether peripheral blood leukocytes from women with a history of preterm birth produce elevated amounts of tnfalpha upon stimulation with pathogens associated with preterm birth and if pre-treatment with aspirin, an anti-inflammatory medication, decreases the ex vivo production of this cytokine. heat-killed bacteria elicited increased tnfalpha production from leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but no differences in tnfalpha production between leukocytes from women with preterm birth and control women with term birth were detected. in women who consumed aspirin each day for one week, tnfalpha production was increased in leukocytes from control women stimulated with escherichia coli and u. urealyticum, but was reduced or unchanged in leukocytes from women with preterm birth. similar trends were observed for a subset of samples stimulated with u. urealyticum and assayed for il-6, il-10, il-1beta and  tnfalpha by bead array. we conclude that leukocytes from women with a history of  preterm birth do not have elevated pro-inflammatory responses to pathogens, and that reproductive history is associated with different effects of aspirin on pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

TI  == structure of laminin-binding adhesin (lmb) from streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == adhesion/invasion of pathogenic bacteria is a critical step in infection and is mediated by surface-exposed proteins termed adhesins. the crystal structure of recombinant lmb, a laminin-binding adhesin from streptococcus agalactiae, has been determined at 2.5 a resolution. based on sequence and structural homology, lmb was placed into the cluster 9 family of the abc (atp-binding cassette) transport system. the structural organization of lmb closely resembles that of abc-type solute-binding proteins (sbps), in which two structurally related globular domains interact with each other to form a metal-binding cavity at the interface. the bound zinc in lmb is tetrahedrally coordinated by three histidines and a glutamate from both domains. a comparison of lmb with other metal transporters revealed an interesting feature of the dimerization of molecules in  the crystallographic asymmetric unit in all zinc-binding transporters. a closer comparison of lmb with the zinc-binding znua from escherichia coli and synechocystis 6803 suggested that lmb might undergo a unique structural rearrangement upon metal binding and release. the crystal structure of lmb provides an impetus for further investigations into the molecular basis of laminin binding by human pathogens. being ubiquitous in all serotypes of group b  streptococcus (gbs), the structure of lmb may direct the development of an efficient vaccine.

AB  == background: preterm birth is increasing worldwide, and late preterm births, which comprise more than 70% of all preterm births, account for much of the increase. early and late onset sepsis results in significant mortality in extremely preterm infants, but little is known about sepsis outcomes in late preterm infants. methods: this is an observational cohort study of infants <121 days of age (119,130 infants less than or equal to 3 days of life and 106,142 infants between 4 and 120 days of life) with estimated gestational age at birth between 34 and 36 weeks, admitted to 248 neonatal intensive care units in the united states between 1996 and 2007. results: during the study period, the cumulative incidence of early and late onset sepsis was 4.42 and 6.30 episodes per 1000 admissions, respectively. gram-positive organisms caused the majority of early and late onset sepsis episodes. infants with early onset sepsis caused by gram-negative rods and infants with late onset sepsis were more likely to die than their peers with sterile blood cultures (odds ratio [or]: 4.39, 95% ci: 1.71-11.23, p = 0.002; and or: 3.37, 95% ci: 2.35-4.84, p < 0.001, respectively). conclusion: late preterm infants demonstrate specific infection rates, pathogen distribution, and mortality associated with early and late onset sepsis. the results of this study  are generalizable to late preterm infants admitted to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit.

AB  == the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) inhibitory titer (csf-it) of an antibiotic, which can be used to estimate the duration of time above the agent's mic in the csf, was introduced as one of the indices to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic  selection in treating bacterial meningitis. the csf-it was determined via a microdilution method. a suspension of the causative organism was added to a tube  containing twofold diluted csf and double-concentrated mueller-hinton broth with  supplement. the csf-it was determined by the maximum point without turbidity of medium after overnight incubation at 37 degrees c. concerning the strain of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (blnar), the  killing rates of both meropenem and piperacillin were compared in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (pk) model, in which human pharmacokinetics in csf were simulated. organisms recovered from the csf in 37 treated clinical cases of bacterial meningitis were h. influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus  pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and neisseria meningitidis; in these cases, the csf-it ranged from 1: 8 to as high as 1: 4 096. in the in vitro pk model, the concentrations of both drugs were higher than the mics over a period of 24 h; however, the killing rate of piperacillin was higher than that of meropenem, and  bacterial regrowth was observed after the administration of meropenem. a csf-it value higher than 1: 32 indicates that the antibiotic concentration in the csf exceeds the mic for 24 h. the effect of piperacillin on blnar depends not only on the time above mic of 24 h but also on the maximum concentration in the csf.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of intravenous ceftiofur sodium and concentration in body fluids of foals.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to determine pharmacokinetics of intravenous (i.v.) ceftiofur in foals, to compare ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectometry (uplc-ms/ms) and microbiologic assay for the measurement of ceftiofur concentrations, and to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ceftiofur against common equine bacterial pathogens. in a cross-over design, ceftiofur sodium was administered i.v. to six  foals (1-2 days-of-age and 4-5 weeks-of-age) at dosages of 5 and 10 mg/kg. subsequently, five doses of ceftiofur were administered i.v. to six additional foals between 1 and 5 days of age at a dose of 5 mg/kg q 12 h. concentrations of  desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (dca), the acetamide derivative of ceftiofur and desfuroylceftiofur-related metabolites were measured in plasma, synovial fluid, urine, and csf by use of uplc-ms/ms. a microbiologic assay was used to measure ceftiofur activity for a subset of plasma samples. following i.v. administration  of ceftiofur at a dose of 5 mg/kg to 1-2 day-old foals, dca had a t(1/2) of 7.8 +/- 0.1 h, a body clearance of 74.4 +/- 8.4 ml/h/kg, and an apparent volume of distribution of 0.83 +/- 0.09 l/kg. after multiple i.v. doses at 5 mg/kg, dca concentrations in csf were significantly lower than concurrent plasma concentrations. ceftiofur activity using a microbiologic assay significantly underestimated plasma concentrations of dca. the mic of ceftiofur required to inhibit growth of 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, pasteurella spp, klebsiella spp, and beta-hemolytic streptococci was <0.5 microg/ml. intravenous administration of ceftiofur sodium at the rate of 5 mg/kg every 12 h would provide sufficient coverage for the treatment of susceptible bacterial isolates.

TI  == acquisition of factor h by a novel surface protein on group b streptococcus promotes complement degradation.
AB  == binding of the host complement regulator, factor h (fh), by some pathogenic microbes constitutes an important virulence mechanism, whereby complement is broken down to help microbes survive in the host. although it has been hypothesized for the past two decades that gbs type iii binds fh via sialic acid  present on its capsule, neither the binding of fh to gbs has been demonstrated nor the mechanism of interaction identified. we observed that fh bound to both wild-type and capsule or sialic acid-deficient gbs that were used as negative controls. wild-type and acapsular gbs were incubated with serum or pure fh degraded almost 90% of c3b, suggesting that the gbs-bound fh maintained cofactor  activity. in addition, dot-blot analysis showed approximately 5-10% of c5 and c9  formation, as compared to an escherichia coli control, suggesting breakdown at the c3b level. protease treatment of the bacteria completely abolished binding of fh. using overlay assays and mass spectroscopic analysis, we identified the fh receptor as the streptococcal histidine triad (sht) surface protein. the ability  of binding fh to sht was further confirmed by using recombinant sht. this report  describes the identification of the sht as an fh-binding protein on the surface of gbs type iii, revealing a novel mechanism by which the bacterium acquires fh to evade complement opsonization.

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == [neonatal group b streptococcus infection: an integrated approach (of clinical pathologists, gynecologists, midwives, pediatricians-neonatologists) of the functional area of cuneo (italy)].
AB  == the frequency of early-onset neonatal sepsis without prophylaxis is 1-5/1.000 live births. since year '70 the most frequent causative microorganism is the group b streptococcus (s. agalactiae, gbs), followed by escherichia coli. the mortality rate is now reduced to 4% due to the improvement of neonatal intensive  care. in the usa, the incidence of gbs early-onset neonatal sepsis has been markedly reduced by the application of the guidelines released by the centers for disease control (cdc). this strategy, however, is not effective on occurrence of  late-onset neonatal group b streptococcal disease. in italy, the application of cdc guidelines is not customary, and different, often complex, protocols of obstetrical-neonatological integrated approach are applied. the frequency of infectious risk has made the gbs a paramount problem for the neonatologist, even  for the legal responsibility issues resulting from the multiplicity of possible options. to reach the best level of protection of the newborn against early-onset gbs infection, the working group of providers of prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care of the functional area of cuneo issued an integrated protocol, in order to perform the gbs screening with the optimal culture method suggested by cdc guidelines in the highest possible number of pregnant women, and to standardize the obstetrical and neonatal management.

TI  == comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the national institutes of health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == we examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. the following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a croatian translation of the nih cpsi questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and stamey localization technique). patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in croatia. an infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), enterococcus in 36 (19%) and escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. in the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: ureaplasma urealyticum, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by e. coli and enterococcus (p<0.001). clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by c. trachomatis, enterococcus and e. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by t. vaginalis.

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time pcr.
AB  == we aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae,  and mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus,  and listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in japan. results in csf from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18)  analyzed by real-time pcr with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. the total time from dna extraction from csf to pcr analysis was 1.5 h. the limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized  for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. the pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time pcr, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. with the real-time pcr, the detection rate of h. influenzae from csf was high, at 45.2%, followed by s. pneumoniae (21.4%), s. agalactiae (2.4%), e. coli (1.8%), l. monocytogenes (0.6%), and m. pneumoniae (0.6%). the detection rate with pcr was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; p=0.0000). in conclusion, detection with real-time  pcr is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.

TI  == characterization and bacterial response of zinc oxide particles prepared by a biomineralization process.
AB  == in this paper, olive-like zno particles were successfully synthesized via a facile biomineralization process in the template of silk fibroin (sf) peptide at  room temperature. the coat of sf peptide on the surface of zno particles had a substantial influence on their morphology during the biomineralization. room-temperature photoluminescence behavior of zno particles indicated that the visible blue emission peak centered at 410 nm was enhanced with the mineralization time. bacteriological tests revealed that the mineralized zno particles with sf peptide were not toxic for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and streptococcus agalactiae, presenting good cytocompatibility due to the  surface coat of peptide. their potential applications in bio-optical detectors could be envisioned.

TI  == antibacterial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials on major bacterial mastitis  pathogens in vitro.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of plant-derived antimicrobials including trans-cinnamaldehyde (tc), eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol on major bacterial mastitis pathogens in milk. the minimum  inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the aforementioned compounds on streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli were determined. in addition, the bactericidal kinetics of tc on the aforementioned pathogens and the persistence of the antimicrobial activity of tc  in milk over a period of 2 wk were investigated. all 4 plant-derived molecules exhibited antimicrobial activity against the 5 mastitis pathogens tested, but tc  was most effective in killing the bacteria. the mic and mbc of tc on staph. aureus, e. coli, and strep. uberis were 0.1 and 0.45%, respectively, whereas that on strep. agalactiae and strep. dysgalactiae were 0.05 and 0.4%, respectively. the mic and mbc of the other 3 molecules ranged from 0.4 to 0.8% and 0.8 to 1.5%, respectively. in time-kill assays, tc at the mbc reduced the bacterial pathogens  in milk by 4.0 to 5.0 log(10) cfu/ml and to undetectable levels within 12 and 24  h, respectively. the antimicrobial effect of tc persisted for the duration of the experiment (14 d) without any loss of activity. results of this study suggest that tc has the potential to be evaluated as an alternative or adjunct to antibiotics as intramammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.

TI  == in silico prioritisation of candidate genes for prokaryotic gene function discovery: an application of phylogenetic profiles.
AB  == background: in silico candidate gene prioritisation (cgp) aids the discovery of gene functions by ranking genes according to an objective relevance score. while  several cgp methods have been described for identifying human disease genes, corresponding methods for prokaryotic gene function discovery are lacking. here we present two prokaryotic cgp methods, based on phylogenetic profiles, to assist with this task. results: using gene occurrence patterns in sample genomes, we developed two cgp methods (statistical and inductive cgp) to assist with the discovery of bacterial gene functions. statistical cgp exploits the differences in gene frequency against phenotypic groups, while inductive cgp applies supervised machine learning to identify gene occurrence pattern across genomes. three rediscovery experiments were designed to evaluate the cgp frameworks. the first experiment attempted to rediscover peptidoglycan genes with 417 published genome sequences. both cgp methods achieved best areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (auc) of 0.911 in escherichia coli k-12 (ec-k12) and 0.978 streptococcus agalactiae 2603 (sa-2603) genomes, with an average improvement in precision of >3.2-fold and a maximum of >27-fold using statistical cgp. a median  auc of >0.95 could still be achieved with as few as 10 genome examples in each group of genome examples in the rediscovery of the peptidoglycan metabolism genes. in the second experiment, a maximum of 109-fold improvement in precision was achieved in the rediscovery of anaerobic fermentation genes in ec-k12. the last experiment attempted to rediscover genes from 31 metabolic pathways in sa-2603, where 14 pathways achieved auc >0.9 and 28 pathways achieved auc >0.8 with the best inductive cgp algorithms. conclusion: our results demonstrate that  the two cgp methods can assist with the study of functionally uncategorised genomic regions and discovery of bacterial gene-function relationships. our rediscovery experiments also provide a set of standard tasks against which future methods may be compared.

TI  == phagocytosis and postphagocytic reaction of cord blood and adult blood monocyte after infection with green fluorescent protein-labeled escherichia coli and group b streptococci.
AB  == background: neonatal sepsis is characterized by an excessive inflammatory response induced by immune cells (monocytes). we investigated the initial stage of monocyte-pathogen interaction, i.e. bacterial ingestion and degradation at the single-cell level, by comparing a new flow cytometric procedure with culture methods. we also examined the hypothesis that, in terms of phagocytosis-induced cell death (picd), phenotype, or cytokine production, cord blood monocytes (cbmo) differ from monocytes derived from adults (peripheral blood monocytes, pbmo). methods: phagocytosis and intracellular degradation were assessed by means of flow cytometry and bacterial cultures of green fluorescent protein-labeled group  b streptococci (gbs) and escherichia coli. the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) was measured through luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. apoptosis, phenotype, and cytokine production were assessed through flow cytometry. results: flow cytometry and bacterial cultures showed no difference between phagocytosis and degradation of gbs and e. coli by pbmo and cbmo. a high correlation between both methods was observed. no difference in ros production was evident. in comparison with pbmo, cbmo apoptosis was lower after exposure to gbs and e. coli. similarities were found between nonapoptotic monocytes and pro-inflammatory monocytes. conclusions: picd is lower in cbmo during the early stages of monocyte-pathogen interaction. our results emphasize that monocyte apoptosis has  a potential role in tailoring the immune response in neonatal sepsis.

TI  == early and late markers for the detection of early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == introduction: in this study we tested how a combination of early and late paraclinic markers could predict early onset neonatal sepsis (eons). methodology: the first 24 hours after the suspicion of eons, we measured interleukine (il)-6,  il-8, il-10, il-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), interferon gamma (inf-gamma), procalcitonin (pct) and c-reactive protein (crp) at 8-hour intervals on 123 neonates clinically suspected for eons. the neonates were divided into two groups. the sepsis group: 1a with blood culture verified bacteraemia and 1b strongly suspected sepsis (29 patients). the no sepsis group: 2a treated with antibiotics (37 patients) and 2b not treated with antibiotics (57 patients). results: combined evaluation of each of the early markers with pct > 25 ng/ml for prediction of eons at time 0, gave the following sensitivities and specificities: il-6 > 250 pg/ml: 71% and 88%; il-8 > 900 pg/ml: 50% and 88%; il-10 > 40 pg/ml: 43% and 87%; and immature/total (i/t) ratio > 0.35: 59% and 88%. the results of il-18, tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma did not predict eons. conclusion: il-6 combined with pct values is a fair way to evaluate eons at the time of suspicion of infection. the "old" early marker, i/t ratio, is almost as efficient as il-6. by  combining an early and a late marker it may be possible to reduce the diagnostic  "non-conclusive" period of paraclinic values.

AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == changing trends in mastitis.
AB  == the global dairy industry, the predominant pathogens causing mastitis, our understanding of mastitis pathogens and the host response to intramammary infection are changing rapidly. this paper aims to discuss changes in each of these aspects. globalisation, energy demands, human population growth and climate change all affect the dairy industry. in many western countries, control programs for contagious mastitis have been in place for decades, resulting in a decrease in occurrence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus mastitis and  an increase in the relative impact of streptococcus uberis and escherichia coli mastitis. in some countries, klebsiella spp. or streptococcus dysgalactiae are appearing as important causes of mastitis. differences between countries in legislation, veterinary and laboratory services and farmers' management practices affect the distribution and impact of mastitis pathogens. for pathogens that have traditionally been categorised as contagious, strain adaptation to human and bovine hosts has been recognised. for pathogens that are often categorised as environmental, strains causing transient and chronic infections are distinguished. the genetic basis underlying host adaptation and mechanisms of infection is being unravelled. genomic information on pathogens and their hosts and improved knowledge of the host's innate and acquired immune responses to intramammary infections provide opportunities to expand our understanding of bovine mastitis. these developments will undoubtedly contribute to novel approaches to mastitis diagnostics and control.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of udder pathogens from cases of acute clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == to investigate occurrence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in udder pathogens mics in staphylococcus aureus (n=211), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n=56), streptococcus uberis (n=113), streptococcus dysgalactiae (n=152), streptococcus agalactiae (n=6), escherichia coli (n=163), and klebsiella spp. (n=42) were determined using microdilution. isolates were from a nation wide survey employing strict inclusion criteria. presence of acquired resistance was evaluated by species-specific epidemiological cut-off values issued by eucast. penicillin or methicillin resistance in staphylococci were however evaluated by beta-lactamase production or presence of the meca gene, respectively. staphylococci were mostly susceptible to antimicrobials tested but 7.1% of s. aureus and 12.5% of cns were resistant to penicillin by beta-lactamase production. methicillin resistance was not found in s. aureus. all streptococcus  dysgalactiae and s. agalactiae were susceptible to penicillin. bimodal mic distributions for tetracycline in s dysgalactiae and s. uberis indicate acquired  resistance in some isolates. among e. coli 12.3% of isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. resistance to streptomycin (11.0%), sulphametoxazole  (8.6%), ampicillin (7.4%), or tetracycline (4.9%) were the most common traits. klebsiella spp. were resistant to ampicillin and some isolates also to tetracycline (7.1%) or sulphonamide (9.5%). the study shows that in sweden bacteria associated with acute clinical mastitis for the most part are susceptible to antimicrobials used in therapy but resistance to penicillin in s.  aureus is not uncommon. penicillin is recommended for treatment of mastitis caused by gram-positive pathogens and regular monitoring of beta-lactamase production in s. aureus is therefore recommended in herds with udder health problems.

TI  == lactic acid is a potential virulence factor for group b streptococcus.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is a gram-positive bacterium that causes sepsis and meningitis in neonates and infants. although several gbs-associated virulence factors have been described, the mechanisms of gbs invasive disease are not well  understood. to characterize additional virulence factors, a novel in vitro infection assay was developed using rat fetal lung explants. however, application of gbs to the system induced rapid lung tissue destruction associated with increased media acidity. since lactic acid produced by other streptococci is an important virulence factor, we hypothesized that lactic acid contributed to the virulence of gbs. spent growth media and neutralized-spent media were applied to  explants and results indicated that neutralization of the media completely protected the tissue from degradation. these results were verified using multiple viability assays and with transformed cell lines. furthermore, comparable spent media from escherichia coli did not induce tissue cytotoxicity, suggesting that gbs produces organic acids in excess of other potential bacterial pathogens. analysis of the spent media indicated that l-lactate levels reached approximately 70 mm, indicating that lactic acid is a major constituent of the metabolic acid produced by gbs. treatment of explants with lactic acid alone produced dose-dependent tissue degradation, indicating that lactic acid is independently sufficient to induce target-tissue cytotoxicity. finally, both spent media and 23.6 mm lactic acid produced dramatic tissue autofluorescence; the basis for this is currently unknown. these studies demonstrate that gbs-produced lactic acid is  a potential virulence factor and may contribute to gbs invasive disease.

TI  == udder shape and teat-end lesions as potential risk factors for high somatic cell  counts and intra-mammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  == the association of common bacterial pathogens in milk samples during calving with udder shape or the presence of 'teat-end' lesions was investigated in 240 dairy cows from two herds. sixty-three of 120 cows (53%) in one herd (herd a) and 54/120 animals (45%) in a second herd (herd b) had normal-shaped udders. the remaining animals had udder shapes defined as follows: large pendulous (18% herd  a, 26% herd b); large between hindquarter (10% herd a, 17% herd b); overall small (8% herd a, 5% herd b); or small but pendulous (11% herd a, 7% herd b). at calving teat-end lesions were present in 63% and 76% of the quarters of herd a and b animals, respectively. there was no herd effect on udder shape or teat-end  lesions. analysis of variance revealed that udder shape and teat-end lesions did  not have a significant association with quarter somatic cell count. however there was some association between mammary infection and udder shape and teat-end lesions. compared to other udder shapes, cows with large between hindquarter shape had significantly less staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus uberis infection (p<0.001). there was a similar albeit less significant negative association with escherichia coli infection (p<0.01). infection with streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae was more frequent in cows with large pendulous and overall small udder conformations. the results also suggest an association between intra-mammary infection at calving and the presence of hyperkeratotic teat-end lesions, given that s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, s. uberis, s. agalactiae and e. coli were cultured from significantly more quarters with such lesions than from quarters without lesions or with other types of lesion (p<0.001).

TI  == characterization of streptococcus gordonii prophage ph15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii omz1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, ph15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. phage ph15 belongs to the siphoviridae. the complete genome sequence of ph15 was determined. the genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 orfs. the genome of ph15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages mm1 and phinih1.1 from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus  pyogenes, respectively. in strain omz1039, ph15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-trna gene. a plasmid, harbouring the attp site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. the phage endolysin was purified after expression in escherichia coli and found to inhibit  growth of all s. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae.

TI  == deaths of early-onset, invasive sepsis in full-term infants in miyazaki: nine cases from a regional population-based analysis from 1998-2006.
AB  == in a population-based study we investigated the early-onset, invasive sepsis caused by group b streptococcus (gbs) and non-gbs in the era of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis. from 1998 to 2006, we had 387 perinatal deaths in 98,495 deliveries, and 9 full-term infants met the criteria of early-onset, invasive sepsis, in which microorganisms were proven from blood sampling. of these cases, 4 involved gbs, 2 ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, 2 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and 1 was unidentified. all 4 cases  of gbs related death underwent improper procedures contrary to the prophylaxis recommendation. eighty percent of non-gbs related deaths had septicemia of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. we found in our population-based study that early-onset, fatal sepsis in full-term infants is associated with insufficient adherence to the prophylaxis strategy for gbs and with the emergence of antimicrobial resistant non-gbs bacteria.

TI  == surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  == background: the urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and  contraceptive agents in recent years. in the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. methodology/principal findings: toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (mdck) cells, human sperm cells, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis. the inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of mdck cells was also tested. a homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-n,n,n-trimethylammonium bromides (c(n)tab), with varying alkyl chains were  shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (cmc), all of them at concentrations significantly below the cmc. in general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than c. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than mdck cells. this suggests that the c(n)tab may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. none of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used  in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection  of mdck cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to mdck cells. conclusions/significance: the results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.

TI  == the response of hek293 cells transfected with bovine tlr2 to established pathogen-associated molecular patterns and to bacteria causing mastitis in cattle.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) are key sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps). their role in immunity is difficult to examine in species of veterinary interest, due to restricted access to the knockout technology and tlr-specific antibodies. an alternative approach is to generate cell lines transfected with various tlrs and to examine the recognition of pamps or relevant bacteria. in this report, we examined whether recognition of various pamps and mastitis-causing bacteria is achieved by transfection of recombinant bovine tlr2  (botlr2). therefore, human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells were transfected by whole botlr2. a clonal analysis of stably transfected cells disclosed variable recognition of several putative tlr2 agonists although expressing similar amounts of the transgene and endogenous tlr6. one clone (clone 25) reacted by copious interleukin-8 (il-8) production to several stimulants of tlr2 such as di-palmitoylated cysteyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lysine (pam2), a biochemical preparation of lipoteichoic acid from staphylococcus aureus, a commercial preparation of peptidoglycan from s. aureus, and heat-killed listeria monocytogenes (hklm). tlr2-dependent induction of il-8 release was stronger in medium containing human serum albumin than in medium containing fetal calf serum. clone 25 cells responded to high concentrations of s. aureus and to escherichia coli causing mastitis, but not to streptococcus uberis and to streptococcus agalactiae which also cause mastitis. stimulation by s. aureus was relatively weak when compared (i) with stimulation of the same cells by hklm and pamps derived from s. aureus, (ii) with a clone stably transfected with tlr4 and md-2 and stimulated by e. coli causing mastitis, and (iii) with interferon-gamma-costimulated bovine macrophages stimulated by s. aureus and s. agalactiae. thus, clone 25 is suitable for studying the interaction of putative tlr2 agonists with bovine tlr2-transfected cells, provides a cell to search for tlr2-specific antibodies, and is a tool for studying the interaction of tlr2 with bacteria causing disease, e.g. mastitis, in cattle.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == integrin beta 1 regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through rac expression.
AB  == phagocytosis and subsequent phagosome maturation by professional phagocytes are essential in the clearance of infectious microbial pathogens. the molecular regulation of phagosome maturation is largely unknown. we show that integrin beta(1) plays critical roles in the phagocytosis of microbial pathogens and phagosome maturation. macrophages lacking integrin beta(1) expression exhibit reduced phagocytosis of bacteria, including group b streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, phagosomes from macrophages lacking integrin  beta(1) show lowered maturation rate, defective acquisition of lysosome membrane  markers, and reduced f-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. integrin  beta(1)-deficient macrophages exhibit impaired bactericidal activity. we found that the expression of the rho family gtpases rac1, rac2, and cdc42 was reduced in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages. ectopic expression of rac1, but not cdc42, in integrin beta(1)-deficient macrophages restored defective phagosome maturation and f-actin accumulation in the periphagosomal region. importantly, macrophages lacking rac1/2 also exhibit defective maturation of phagosomes derived from opsonized escherichia coli or igg beads. taken together, these results suggest that integrin beta(1) regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through rac expression.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (ply700) from streptococcus uberis.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. a prophage was isolated from a strain of streptococcus uberis (atcc 700407) following exposure to mitomycin c. partial sequencing of the phage dna revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. the putative lysin (ply700) was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. addition of the purified ply700 to bacterial suspensions of s. uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, or e. coli. killing of s. uberis in milk by ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (p<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (p<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. in contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. functional characterization of the c-terminal domain, as a component of a gfp fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to s. uberis. the  c-terminal domain may have utility in targeting s. uberis while it remains to be  determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of s. uberis mastitis.

TI  == inactivation of bacterial pathogens in human milk by high-pressure processing.
AB  == low-temperature, long-time (ltlt) pasteurization assures the safety of banked human milk; however, heat can destroy important nutritional biomolecules. high-pressure processing (hpp) shows promise as an alternative for pasteurization of breast milk. the purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of hpp  for inactivation of selected bacterial pathogens in human milk. human milk was inoculated with one of five pathogens (10(8) to 10(9) cfu/ml), while 0.1% peptone solution solutions with the same levels of each organism were used as controls. the samples were subjected to 400 mpa at 21 to 31 degrees c for 0 to 50 min or to 62.5 degrees c for 0 to 30 min (capillary tube method) to simulate ltlt pasteurization. tryptic soy agar and selective media were used for enumeration. traditional thermal pasteurization resulted in inactivation (> 7 log) of all pathogens within 10 min. in human milk and in peptone solution, a 6-log reduction was achieved after 30 min of hpp for staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538. after 30 min, s. aureus atcc 25923 was reduced by 8 log and 6 log in human milk and peptone solution, respectively. treatments of 4 and 7 min resulted in an 8-log inactivation of streptococcus agalactiae atcc 12927 in human milk and peptone solution, respectively, while listeria monocytogenes atcc 19115 required 2 min for an 8-log inactivation in human milk. escherichia coli atcc 25922 was inactivated by 8 log after 10 min in peptone solution and by 6 log after 30 min in human milk. these data suggest that hpp may be a promising alternative for pasteurization of human milk. further research should evaluate the efficacy of hpp in the inactivation of relevant viral pathogens.

TI  == reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  == the evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. in many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. it has recently  been suggested that serum procalcitonin (pct) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. this study was designed to determine the reliability of pct concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (il-6) and c-reactive protein (crp) values. the current study included 69 newborn babies. after full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. they had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. the second group: group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and  were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified  into twosubgroups: group 2a; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal  sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2b included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood  culture. blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and  blood chemistry, additionally, crp, serum il-6 and pct were measured. the microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2a; escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group b streptococci (gbs) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was gbs positive mother. the comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (wbcs) and crp levels were  significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and group 2b. while in group 2b the wbcs not differed from group 1 but crp differed from group 1. il-6 and pct values were significantly increased in group 2a more than in group 1 and  group 2b. furthermore in group 2b both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. for the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, pct give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (ppv) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (npv) of 76.7%. at a cutoff >140 ng/ml, il-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, specificity of 70.4%, ppv of 64%, npv of 63.3%. however, at a cutoff >12 mg/l, crp gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, ppv of 77.1%, npv of 70%. we conclude that the serum pct concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal  sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.

AB  == streptococcus uberis ucn 42, isolated from a case of bovine mastitis, was intermediately resistant to lincomycin (mic = 2 microg/ml) while remaining susceptible to clindamycin (mic = 0.06 microg/ml) and erythromycin. a 1.1-kb saci fragment was cloned from s. uberis ucn 42 total dna on plasmid puc 18 and introduced into escherichia coli ag100a, where it conferred resistance to both clindamycin and lincomycin. the sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of a new gene, named lnu(d), that encoded a 164-amino-acid protein with  53% identity with lnu(c) previously reported to occur in streptococcus agalactiae. crude lysates of e. coli ag100a containing the cloned lnu(d) gene inactivated lincomycin and clindamycin in the presence of atp and mgcl(2). mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that the lnu(d) enzyme catalyzed adenylylation of clindamycin. a domain conserved in deduced sequences of lincosamide o-nucleotidyltransferases lnu(a), lnu(c), lina(n2), and lin(d) and in the aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase ant(2'') was identified.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an argentinean multicenter study.
AB  == tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. we conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 argentinean institutions. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. the number of isolates and mics 50/90 (mg/l) for tigecycline were the following: acinetobacter spp. 132  (0.5/1); escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); s. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). we conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in argentina.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == effects of complement regulators bound to escherichia coli k1 and group b streptococcus on the interaction with host cells.
AB  == escherichia coli k1 and group b streptococcus (gbs) are the most common bacteria  that cause meningitis during the neonatal period. complement, the first line of defence in the host, acts on these bacteria to opsonize with various components of complement for subsequent presentation to phagocytes. to counteract these opsonization effects, e. coli and gbs bind to the complement regulators c4 binding protein and factor h, respectively. nonetheless, the deposition of complement components on these two bacteria from neonatal serum and their effect  on the host cell interaction is unclear. here we demonstrated that the deposition of complement proteins from adult serum prevented the invasion of e. coli into human brain microvascular endothelial cells, whereas the invasion of gbs was enhanced. in contrast, treatment with cord serum had no effect on the invasion of both these bacteria. we also examined the effect of the deposited complement proteins on phagocytosis using thp-1 cells and thp-1 cells differentiated into macrophages. escherichia coli treated with adult serum neither attached nor entered these cells, whereas gbs was phagocytosed and survived efficiently. we further demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of complement proteins is the result of the bound complement inhibitors c4b-binding protein, in the case of e.  coli, and factor h, in the case of gbs. taken together, these results suggest that e. coli and gbs utilize contrasting mechanisms of complement-mediated interactions with their target cells for successful establishment of disease.

TI  == [neonatal infections of the bones and joints].
AB  == neonatal osteoarticular infections remain rare, with an estimated incidence of 1  to 3 cases per 1000 admissions to neonatal intensive care units. it usually results from bacteraemia and may thus be induced by iv catheters. more rarely it  is due to direct inoculation secondary to cutaneous damage, or extension of soft  tissue infection. the particularity of bone vascularization in the newborn explains the frequency of abscess formation in the periosteum or in soft tissues. the main pathogen involved is s. aureus (3/4 of cases), followed by group b streptococci and enterobacteriacae. infection consists mainly of localised and slowly progressing abscesses. however, multifocal and severe infection is possible, in particular when caused by an iv catheter. ultrasonography is the best initial investigation, possibly leading to surgical care. medical treatment  must include 2 synergistic antistaphyloccocal antibiotics, possibly associated with cefotaxime. the outcome is generally favorable, but orthopaedic consequences may emerge if the growth plate is involved. rare specific causes, such as syphilis or tuberculosis, should also be evoked, but the clinical context is generally helpful for the diagnosis.

AB  == putative n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase genes from lambdasa1 and lambdasa2 prophages of streptococcus agalactiae were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the purified enzymes lysed the cell walls of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the peptidoglycan digestion  products in the cell wall lysates were not consistent with amidase activity. instead, the structure of the muropeptide digestion fragments indicated that both the lambdasa1 and lambdasa2 lysins exhibited gamma-d-glutaminyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity. the endopeptidase cleavage specificity of the lysins was  confirmed using a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to a portion of the stem peptide and cross bridge of streptococcus agalactiae peptidoglycan. the lambdasa2 lysin also displayed beta-d-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity.

TI  == levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from cord blood in-vitro are pathogen dependent and increased in comparison to adult controls.
AB  == background: overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a role in increased morbidity and mortality from neonatal sepsis. objective of this study was to compare secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the cord blood cells of healthy term neonates to the venous blood cells of healthy adults in vitro after  stimulation with common neonatal pathogens. method: blood samples were cultured in the presence of heat-killed group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs), escherichia coli (e. coli) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi). concentrations of secreted cytokines (interleukine-6, il-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tnf-alpha, interleukine-1 beta, il-1beta and interleukine-8, il-8)  were measured after 0, 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation using chemiluminescent immunometric automated assay. results: blood samples from 22 neonates and 16 adults were compared. after stimulation by gbs and e. coli, cord blood cells secreted significantly higher levels of il-6 and il-8 than blood cells of healthy adults. in cord blood, e. coli induced secretion of higher concentration of il-6, tnf-alpha, il-1beta and il-8 than s. epi, and more il-6 than gbs; gbs induced more il-1beta than s.epi. conclusions: response of cord blood to microbial activators is different from that of adult controls. each isolate of heat-killed  bacteria induced different amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. this may represent a useful in vitro virulence test.

TI  == neua sialic acid o-acetylesterase activity modulates o-acetylation of capsular polysaccharide in group b streptococcus.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis.  a major gbs virulence determinant is its sialic acid (sia)-capped capsular polysaccharide. recently, we discovered the presence and genetic basis of capsular sia o-acetylation in gbs. we now characterize a gbs sia o-acetylesterase that modulates the degree of gbs surface o-acetylation. the gbs sia o-acetylesterase operates cooperatively with the gbs cmp-sia synthetase, both part of a single polypeptide encoded by the neua gene. neua de-o-acetylation of free 9-o-acetyl-n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5,9ac(2)) was enhanced by ctp and mg(2+), the substrate and co-factor, respectively, of the n-terminal gbs cmp-sia  synthetase domain. in contrast, the homologous bifunctional neua esterase from escherichia coli k1 did not display cofactor dependence. further analyses showed  that in vitro, gbs neua can operate via two alternate enzymatic pathways: de-o-acetylation of neu5,9ac(2) followed by cmp activation of neu5ac or activation of neu5,9ac(2) followed by de-o-acetylation of cmp-neu5,9ac(2). consistent with in vitro esterase assays, genetic deletion of gbs neua led to accumulation of intracellular o-acetylated sias, and overexpression of gbs neua reduced o-acetylation of sias on the bacterial surface. site-directed mutagenesis of conserved asparagine residue 301 abolished esterase activity but preserved cmp-sia synthetase activity, as evidenced by hyper-o-acetylation of capsular polysaccharide sias on gbs expressing only the n301a neua allele. these studies demonstrate a novel mechanism regulating the extent of capsular sia o-acetylation in intact bacteria and provide a genetic strategy for manipulating gbs o-acetylation in order to explore the role of this modification in gbs pathogenesis and immunogenicity.

AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == development of specific and rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in dairy products by pcr.
AB  == a simple and specific method for direct detection of bovine mastitis pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae (gbs), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) in milk products, bacterial samples from milk and isolated bacterial dna was developed. the method is based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using sequence-specific primers only for gbs and species-specific primers derived from  16s and 23s rrna for all chosen species. the presence of the gene of surface immunogenic protein (sip) in bovine gbs isolates, described previously only in human gbs isolates was confirmed. the gbs detection was performed with the sequence coding for surface immunogenic protein from gbs human isolates designated as sip specific sequence (sss); this sequence was selected for specific primer design. the sequence is unique for gbs and was designed from a consensus of all known sip genes. the specific identification was shown on a collection of 75 gbs bovine isolates from different localities in slovakia. all isolates were positive to sss, 16s and 23s rrna sequence. the 16s and 23s rrna pcr detection was also performed with s. aureus and e. coli isolates and specific pcr products were also detected. the detection limit of this assay for milk products was 6 cfu/microl (i.e. 6000 cfu/ml) for gbs and e. coli, and 16 cfu/microl for s. aureus. this rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic method can be performed within hours and represents an innovative diagnostic tool for the detection of milk pathogens in dairy products.

TI  == consequences of prophylaxis for group b streptococcal infections of the neonate.
AB  == in the 1970s, group b streptococci emerged as the leading cause of neonatal infections. the incidence ranged between 1.5 and 2 cases per 1000 in the u.s. in  the 1980s up to the early 1990s. in the 1980s, selective treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics of mothers in labor turned out to be the most successful  mode of prevention. in 1996, the cdc, american college of obstetrics and gynecology, and the american academy of pediatrics recommended the use of one of  two prevention strategies: the culture-based strategy or a risk-based strategy for mothers who did not have prenatal cultures. in 2002, the guidelines were updated to recommend as preferable the culture-based method, which was found to result in superior prevention compared with the risk-based method. subsequent to  the 1996 recommendations, early-onset gbs infection has been reduced by greater than 70% and racial inequalities have been narrowed. whether exposure of millions of mothers to penicillin or ampicillin will have an undesirable effect of causing more escherichia coli infections in neonates or will result in more ampicillin-resistant organisms being responsible for early-onset neonatal infections remains unclear.

TI  == stochastic modeling to determine the economic effects of blanket, selective, and  no dry cow therapy.
AB  == in many countries, blanket dry cow therapy (dct) is the standard way to dry off cows. because of concerns about antibiotic resistance, selective dct is proposed  as an alternative. the economic consequences of different types of dct were studied previously, but variation between input traits and different types of pathogens were not taken into account. the goal of this study was to create a stochastic monte carlo model to simulate the dynamics of intramammary infections  (imi) around the dry period to predict the economic consequences of dct for different types of pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli). the traits used in the model can be varied. the probabilities within the basic situation were collected from the literature and, because not all information needed was available in the literature, by interviewing experts (n = 10). the expert opinions were translated into minimum, most expected, and maximum values for each of the different probabilities. for dutch farmers, the costs associated  with mastitis and mastitis control around the dry period varied between 10.61 euros and 26.61 euros (average 15.60 euros) for blanket dct, between 4.86 euros and 29.41 euros (average 13.72 euros) for selective dct, and between 4.08 euros and 42.60 euros (average 18.02 euros) for no dct. although there were small differences between the treatment groups, the variation within the treatment groups was much larger. the major portion of the costs for selective treatment (59% of the total costs) and no dct (82%) was derived from the costs of clinical  mastitis after calving, and for blanket dct, the costs of treatment (65%) exceeded the costs of clinical mastitis (27%). the cost of mastitis around the dry period was most sensitive to a change in the risk of new imi during the dry period, spontaneous cure, and costs associated with the antibiotic treatment. the optimal decision to dry off cows depends on the attitude of the farmer toward risk and other farm-specific traits and probabilities such as the new imi rate during the dry period. therefore, it is necessary to make farm-specific calculations so that farmers are able to factor this information into their decisions when choosing the best dct for their situations.

TI  == streptococcus agalactiae gapdh is a virulence-associated immunomodulatory protein.
AB  == certain extracellular proteins produced by several pathogenic microorganisms interfere with the host immune system facilitating microbial colonization and were thus designated virulence-associated immunomodulatory proteins. in this study, a protein with b lymphocyte stimulatory activity was isolated from culture supernatants of streptococcus agalactiae strain nem316. this protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kda, was identified as gapdh by n-terminal amino acid sequencing. the gapc gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli for the production of a recombinant histidyl-tagged protein. the recombinant gapdh (rgapdh), purified in an enzymatically active form, induced in vitro an up-regulation of cd69 expression on b cells from normal and bcr transgenic mice.  in addition, rgapdh induced an increase in the numbers of total, but not of rgapdh-specific, splenic ig-secreting cells in c57bl/6 mice treated i.p. with this protein. these in vitro- and in vivo-elicited b cell responses suggest that  the b cell stimulatory effect of rgapdh is independent of bcr specificity. a s. agalactiae strain overexpressing gapdh showed increased virulence as compared with the wild-type strain in c57bl/6 mice. this virulence was markedly reduced in il-10-deficient and anti-rgapdh antiserum-treated mice. these results suggest that il-10 production, which was detected at higher concentrations in the serum of rgapdh-treated mice, is important in determining the successfulness of the host colonization by s. agalactiae and they highlight the direct role of gapdh in this process. taken together, our data demonstrate that s. agalactiae gapdh is a  virulence-associated immunomodulatory protein.

AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == novel substrate specificity of glutathione synthesis enzymes from streptococcus agalactiae and clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and glutathione synthetase (gs) in living organisms. recently, bifunctional fusion protein, termed gamma-gcs-gs catalyzing both gamma-gcs and gs reactions from gram-positive firmicutes streptococcus agalactiae, has been reported. we revealed that in the gamma-gcs activity, s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs had different substrate specificities from those of escherichia coli gamma-gcs. furthermore, s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-glu-x(aa)-gly, from free three amino acids. in clostridium acetobutylicum,  the genes encoding gamma-gcs and putative gs were found to be immediately adjacent by blast search, and had amino acid sequence homology with s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs, respectively. we confirmed that the proteins expressed from each gene showed gamma-gcs and gs activity, respectively. c. acetobutylicum gs had broad substrate specificities and synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-glu-cys-x(aa). whereas the substrate specificities of gamma-gcs domain protein and gs domain protein of s. agalactiae  gamma-gcs-gs were the same as those of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs.

TI  == multiple interactions of fbsa, a surface protein from streptococcus agalactiae, with fibrinogen: affinity, stoichiometry, and structural characterization.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is an etiological agent of several infective diseases in humans. we previously demonstrated that fbsa, a fibrinogen-binding protein expressed by this bacterium, elicits a fibrinogen-dependent aggregation of platelets. in the present communication, we show that the binding of fbsa to fibrinogen is specific and saturable, and that the fbsa-binding site resides in the d region of fibrinogen. in accordance with the repetitive nature of the protein, we found that fbsa contains multiple binding sites for fibrinogen. by using several biophysical methods, we provide evidence that the addition of fbsa  induces extensive fibrinogen aggregation and has noticeable effects on thrombin-catalyzed fibrin clot formation. fibrinogen aggregation was also found to depend on fbsa concentration and on the number of fbsa repeat units. scanning  electron microscopy evidentiated that, while fibrin clot is made of a fine fibrillar network, fbsa-induced fbg aggregates consist of thicker fibers organized in a cage-like structure. the structural difference of the two structures was further indicated by the diverse immunological reactivity and capability to bind tissue-type plasminogen activator or plasminogen. the mechanisms of fbsa-induced fibrinogen aggregation and fibrin polymerization followed distinct pathways since fbg assembly was not inhibited by gprp, a specific inhibitor of fibrin polymerization. this finding was supported by the different sensitivity of the aggregates to the disruptive effects of urea and guanidine hydrochloride. we suggest that fbsa and fibrinogen play complementary roles in contributing to thrombogenesis associated with s. agalactiae infection.

TI  == identification and sequence of a tet(m) tetracycline resistance determinant homologue in clinical isolates of escherichia coli.
AB  == the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in human clinical  isolates of escherichia coli is described for the first time in this report. the  homologue was >99% identical to the tet(m) genes reported to occur in lactobacillus plantarum, neisseria meningitidis, and streptococcus agalactiae, and 3% of the residues in its deduced amino acid sequence diverge from tet(m) of  staphylococcus aureus. sequence analysis of the regions immediately flanking the  gene revealed that sequences upstream of tet(m) in e. coli have homology to tn916; however, a complete is26 insertion element was present immediately upstream of the promoter element. downstream from the termination codon is an insertion sequence that was homologous to the isvs1 element reported to occur in  a plasmid from vibrio salmonicida that has been associated with another tetracycline resistance determinant, tet(e). results of mating experiments demonstrated that the e. coli tet(m) gene was on a mobile element so that resistance to tetracycline and minocycline could be transferred to a susceptible  strain by conjugation. expression of the cloned tet(m) gene, under the control of its own promoter, provided tetracycline and minocycline resistance to the e. coli host.

TI  == evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the dar es salaam region, tanzania.
AB  == a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (msps) in dar es salaam region. total bacterial count (tbc) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the california mastitis test (cmt) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. moreover, a water sample at each msp was taken for bacteriological culturing. finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the msps to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. a total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in dar es salaam region. the mean tbc was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were escherichia coli (6.3%), bacillus cereus (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). in most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the cmt and  7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. tbc was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of tbc were identified by fitting two linear regression models. in a random effect model, water microbial quality,  frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log tbc. in a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log tbc. it was concluded that the milk sold in dar es salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.

TI  == c-terminal wxl domain mediates cell wall binding in enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == analysis of the genome sequence of enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate v583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative n-terminal signal peptide and a conserved c-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated wxl. proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized that the wxl region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. this hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the c-terminal regions of two wxl proteins in e. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. we demonstrated that the c-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the  reporter fusions in e. faecalis. this localization was eliminated by introducing  specific deletions into the domains. interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. we also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for wxl domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. based on our findings, we propose that the wxl region is a novel cell wall binding domain in e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == dna methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  == recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (tn1207.3 and phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]). the dissemination of elements belonging to the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of gas, streptococcus dysgalactiae  subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae recovered in portugal was surveyed. in total, 149 gas, 18 s. pneumoniae, 4 s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 s. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the m phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of tn1207.3/phi10394.4 by pcr targeting open reading frames (orfs) specific for these related elements. all the gas isolates tested and one of the s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried tn1207.3. however, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. it was also noted that the dnas of the isolates carrying tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease smai. cloning and expression of orf12 of tn1207.3 in escherichia coli showed that it encoded a  methyltransferase that rendered dna refractory to cleavage by smai (m.spy10394i). using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are  widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible gas isolates presenting the m phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.

TI  == gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  == in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.

TI  == transport of multidrug resistance substrates by the streptococcus agalactiae hemolysin transporter.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]) causes neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, as well as infections of the bovine udder. the s. agalactiae hemolysin is regarded as an important virulence factor, and hemolysin  expression is dependent on the cyl gene cluster. cyla and cylb encode the atp binding and transmembrane domains of a typical atp binding cassette (abc) transporter. the deduced proteins contain the signature sequence of a multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter, and mutation of the genes results in a nonhemolytic and nonpigmented phenotype. to further elucidate the function of the putative transporter, nonpolar deletion mutants of cyla were constructed. these mutants are nonhemolytic and can be complemented by the transporter genes. wild-type strain and nonhemolytic cyla and cylk deletion mutants were exposed to known substrates of mdr transporters. mutation of cyla significantly impaired growth in the presence of daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and rhodamine 6g and resulted in a decreased export of doxorubicin from the cells. the mutation of cylk, a gene of unknown function located downstream from cyla, caused a loss of hemolysis but had no effect on the transport of mdr substrates. furthermore, the hemolytic activity of the wild-type strain was inhibited by reserpine in a dose-dependent manner. we conclude that cylab closely resembles an abc-type mdr transporter and propose that the gbs hemolysin molecule represents a natural substrate of the transporter.

AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

AB  == aims: lactobacilli, the predominant micro-organisms of the vaginal microbiota, play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract by preventing  the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. the aim of the present study was to assess the ability of four vaginal lactobacillus strains, previously selected for their probiotic features, to block in vitro the adherence of three human urogenital pathogens to vaginal epithelial cells (vec). methods and results: three types of assays were performed in order to determine the inhibitory effect  of lactobacilli on adhesion of urogenital pathogens to vec: blockage by exclusion (lactobacilli and vec followed by pathogens), competition (lactobacilli, vec and  pathogens together) and displacement (pathogens and vec followed by the addition  of lactobacilli). bacterial adhesion to vec was quantified by microscopy (x1000)  after gram's stain. all the strains were able to inhibit by exclusion and competition the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to vec but none was able to decrease the attachment of escherichia coli by neither of the mechanisms assayed. only lactobacillus acidophillus crl 1259 and lactobacillus paracasei crl 1289 inhibited the attachment of group b streptococci (gbs) to vec by exclusion and competition respectively. conclusions: lactobacillus of vaginal origin were able  to inhibit the attachment of genitouropathogenic staph. aureus and gbs to the vaginal epithelium. significance and impact of the study: the results support the probiotic potential of these lactobacillus strains as anti-infective agents in the vagina and encourage further studies about their capacity to prevent and manage urogenital tract infections in females.

AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) are a frequent problem in primary care. they occur mainly in women without underlying diseases and with no functional or structural  anomalies of the urinary tract; consequently most cases are considered uncomplicated uti. etiology is influenced by factors such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, urinary catheterization, and other factors. escherichia coli  causes 80-85% of acute episodes of uncomplicated cystitis. staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus agalactiae and klebsiella spp. are responsible for most of the remaining episodes. the spectrum of bacteria that causes complicated uti is much broader. rates of resistance have undergone considerable variations, and consequently the empirical treatment of uti requires constant updating of the antibiotic sensitivity of the main uropathogens of the area, country or institution. to correctly interpret the global data on sensitivity, the type of uti (uncomplicated versus complicated), sex, age and previous antibiotic therapy in each patient must be taken into account. resistance in uncomplicated uti has clinical significance (although less than in  systemic infections such as bacteremia), which depends on whether the infection is cystitis or pyelonephritis.

TI  == [trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in japan (2003-2004)].
AB  == we surveyed the epidemiology of pediatric bacterial meningitis between january 2003 and december 2004 in japan, with the following results: bacterial meningitis cases numbered 233 (132 boys, 98 girls, and 3 unidentified), equivalent to 1.13-1.6 children of 1000 hospitalized in pediatrics per year. the age distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age, decreasing with increasing age. haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, and escherichia coli. the relationship between causactive pathogens and age distribution was as follows: group b. streptococcus and e. coli were major pathogens below 4 months of age and h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were major pathogens above 4 months of age. susceptibility tests at each facility demonstrated that 65.0% of h. influenzae isolates and 83.0% of s. pneumoniae isolates in 2004 were drug-resistant. ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are currently effective against gbs, e. coli and listeria so a combination of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics is used first line at many facilities for patients below 4 months of age. a combination of carbapenem which showed effective against prsp and cephem which showed effective against h. influenzae is the first choice in childhood bacterial meningitis for patients above 4 months of age.

TI  == a retrospective study of the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the dar es salaam region of tanzania.
AB  == a 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the dar es salaam region of tanzania over the period november 1971-december 2002. laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and escherichia coli (14.1%). other isolates included pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and streptococcus uberis (4.2%). contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were candida species. the results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical candida albicans mastitis. the prevalence of candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in november 2002. conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae remain above 10%. the possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.

TI  == the traa relaxase autoregulates the putative type iv secretion-like system encoded by the broad-host-range streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pip501.
AB  == the conjugative multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid pip501 can be transferred  and stably maintained in a variety of gram-positive genera, including multicellular streptomyces lividans, as well as in gram-negative escherichia coli. the 15 putative pip501 transfer (tra) genes are organized in an operon-like structure terminating in a strong transcriptional terminator. this paper reports  co-transcription of the pip501 tra genes in exponentially growing enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 cells, as shown by rt-pcr. the tra genes are expressed throughout  the life cycle of ent. faecalis, and the expression level is independent of the growth phase. electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the traa relaxase, the first gene of the tra operon, binds to the tra promoter p(tra), which partially overlaps with the origin of transfer (orit). dnase i footprinting experiments further delimited the traa binding region and defined the nucleotides bound by traa. beta-galactosidase assays with p(tra)-lacz fusions proved p(tra) promoter activity, which was strongly repressed when traa was supplied in trans.  thus, it is concluded that the pip501 tra operon is negatively autoregulated at the transcriptional level by the conjugative dna relaxase traa.

TI  == evaluation of a new chromogenic medium for isolation and identification of common urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == in the study presented here, a new chromogenic medium (cps id 3; biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was compared to routine media for the isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria recovered from urine specimens, and a cost analysis was performed. escherichia coli, proteeae tribe, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and streptococcus agalactiae grew on the chromogenic medium as typical differentiated colonies and  were accurately identified even in mixed cultures. although the similarity of colors produced by isolates belonging to the klebsiella, enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter (kesc) group prevents differentiation among them, members of kesc were easily identified as coliforms. no substantial difference was observed when  comparing the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on colonies selected from reference media versus cps id 3. use of the new medium was associated with a savings of 75% over the conventional methods and the api system. furthermore, this medium facilitated a remarkable reduction in the laboratory workload and consequently resulted in additional time and cost savings.

TI  == the group b streptococcal sialic acid o-acetyltransferase is encoded by neud, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  == nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (sia), and several sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. some pathogens are also known to o-acetylate their sias, although  the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. we report that neud, a gene located within the group b streptococcus (gbs) sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a sia o-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (cps) sialylation. homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified lys-123 as a critical residue for sia o-acetyltransferase activity. moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neud can determine whether gbs displays a "high" or "low" sia o-acetylation phenotype. complementation analysis  revealed that escherichia coli k1 neud also functions as a sia o-acetyltransferase in gbs. in fact, neud homologs are commonly found within sia  biosynthetic gene clusters. a bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neud. included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens legionella pneumophila, vibrio parahemeolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for sia expression. phylogenetic analysis shows that neud homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-sia o-acetyltransferase of e.  coli k1. these studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of gbs sia o-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.

TI  == characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (gshf) of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ecl) and glutathione synthetase (gs) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ecl is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas gs enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain atp-grasp fold. this generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the pasteurellaceae member haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed gshf), as has been reported recently for the  gram-positive firmicutes streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes. here, we show that yet another member of the pasteurellaceae family, pasteurella  multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and gshf-driven biosynthesis. domain architecture analysis shows that this p. multocida gshf bifunctional ligase contains an n-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ecl-like domain followed by a typical atp-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known gs ligases. recombinant p. multocida gshf overexpresses as an approximately 85-kda protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. the gamma-ecl activity of gshf is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (k(i) = 13.6 mm). furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of gshf proteins.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

AB  == the data of 1692 susceptibility tests acquired from april 2003 through march 2004 in the mastitis laboratory of the institute for food quality and safety were summarized in order to help veterinarians confronted with acute mastitis in choosing the appropriate antibiotic. two thirds of the milk samples were infected with gram-positive cocci. one third of these were identified as streptococcus (s.) uberis, one fourth as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. all isolates (100%) of s.  uberis, s. dysgalactiae, s. agalactiae and arcanobacterium pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. concering s. aureus, nearly 100% of the isolates were susceptible to oxacillin, cephalothin, cefacetril, cefquinom and neomycin, but only 88% of the isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefoperazon. the gram-negative rods (escherichia (e.) coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas spp.) displayed an irregular resistance pattern. more than 93% of all examined isolates including pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to colistin. the sensitivity of e. coli and klebsiella spp.to marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin and  cefquinom exceeded 96%. thus, the susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens to common antibiotics is favourable. because the highly effective colistin is no longer approved for local therapy, the situation for gram-negative bacteria is more difficult.

TI  == antibacterial effect of caprylic acid and monocaprylin on major bacterial mastitis pathogens.
AB  == bovine mastitis is the most significant economic drain on the worldwide dairy industry. concerns regarding poor cure rates, emergence of bacterial resistance,  and residues in milk necessitate development of alternative therapeutic approaches to antibiotics for treatment of mastitis. a variety of free fatty acids and their monoglycerides have been reported to exert antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. the objective of our study was to examine the efficacy of caprylic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, and its monoglyceride, monocaprylin, to inactivate common mastitis pathogens, including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. milk samples containing 50 mm or 100 mm caprylic acid, and 25 mm or 50 mm monocaprylin were inoculated separately with a 3-isolate mixture of each of the 5 pathogens, and incubated at 39 degrees c. populations of surviving bacteria were determined at 0 min, 1 min, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of incubation. both caprylic acid and monocaprylin reduced all 5 pathogens by >5.0 log cfu/ml after 6 h of incubation. among the bacterial species tested, strep. agalactiae, strep. dysgalactiae, and strep. uberis were most sensitive, and e. coli was most tolerant to caprylic acid and monocaprylin. results of this study indicate that caprylic acid and monocaprylin should be evaluated as alternatives  or adjuncts to antibiotics as intra-mammary infusion to treat bovine mastitis.

TI  == early onset neonatal meningitis in australia and new zealand, 1992-2002.
AB  == objectives: to study the epidemiology of early onset neonatal bacterial meningitis (eonbm) in australasia. design: prospective surveillance study, 1992-2002, in 20 neonatal units in australia and new zealand. eonbm was defined as meningitis occurring within 48 hours of delivery. results: there were 852 babies with early onset sepsis, of whom 78 (9.2%) had eonbm. the incidence of early onset group b streptococcal meningitis fell significantly from a peak of 0.24/1000 live births in 1993 to 0.03/1000 in 2002 (p trend = 0.002). there was no significant change over time in the incidence of escherichia coli meningitis.  the rate of eonbm in very low birthweight babies was 1.09/1000 compared with the  rate in all infants of 0.11/1000. the overall rate of eonbm was 0.41/1000 in 1992 and 0.06 in 2001, but this trend was not significant (p trend = 0.07). case-fatality rates for eonbm did not change significantly with time. birth weight <1500 g (odds ratio (or) 7.2 (95% confidence interval (ci) 4.8 to 10.9)) and gram negative bacillary meningitis (or 3.3 (95% ci 2.2 to 4.9)) were significant risk factors for mortality. sixty two percent of the 129 babies who died from early onset sepsis or suspected sepsis did not have a lumbar puncture performed. conclusion: the incidence of early onset group b streptococcal meningitis has fallen, probably because of maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, without a corresponding change in e. coli meningitis. gram negative  bacillary meningitis still carries a worse prognosis than meningitis with a gram  positive organism.

TI  == rapid detection of group b streptococcus and escherichia coli in amniotic fluid using real-time fluorescent pcr.
AB  == objective: to establish reliability and validity of real-time fluorescent pcr for early detection of bacterial invasion of the amniotic cavity. methods: amniotic fluid samples from 40 patients undergoing mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees c and were cultured on media specific for group b streptococcus (gbs) and e. coli. concurrently, samples were analyzed with real-time fluorescent pcr (roche lightcycler) using dna primers and probes designed to detect the camp factor encoding cfb gene and uida gene of gbs and e.  coli, respectively. for positive control and to simulate amniotic fluid colonization, 104 cfu/ml of gbs and e. coli were inoculated on sterile amniotic fluid and incubated for 6 h. bacterial genomic dna for the two organisms was extracted and purified via the two-step precipitation method using a commercial kit. the real-time pcr assays were also tested against 25 non-gbs and non-e. coli bacterial species. the lower limit of detection for each pathogen was established using serial dilution of bacterial genomic dna. results: all patient samples were negative for evidence of gbs and e. coli with both culture and real-time pcr methods. amniotic fluid samples inoculated with gbs and e. coli were positive with real-time pcr whereas the 25 bacterial species other than gbs or e. coli tested negative with the assay. average total sample processing time including the pre-enrichment step was 7 h 40 min. the average cost for dna extraction and pcr testing was 8.50 dollars per test. conclusion: real-time fluorescent pcr is a valid and reliable method for detection of specific pathogens in amniotic fluid.  this technique is sensitive for low inoculation levels. real-time fluorescent pcr has potential to impact clinical management as a rapid, reliable detection method for gbs and e. coli in chorioamnionitis.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  == we compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (ccl), cefroxadine (cxd), cefdinir (cfdn), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefteram (cftm), cefcapene (cfpn), and cefditoren (cdtr), against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and esbl-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in kansai medical university hospital between 2002 and 2003. based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above mic (tam) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. in s. pneumoniae strains, the mic(50,80,90) values of cdtr were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the  most potent antimicrobial activity. however, the efficacy rate for cdtr calculated based on the pk/pd theory was 58.5%. cftm showed the highest efficacy  rate (66.1%). in h. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of cdtr was most potent, followed by that of cftm and that of cfpn/cfix. the mic90 value of cdtr was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of cftm (0.5 microg/ml). the efficacy rate for cdtr was 100%. this result supports that cdtr frequently eradicates h. influenzae. in e. coli strains, the mic90 values of the above agents, excluding ccl and cxd, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. the antimicrobial  activity of cfix against k. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of cfdn/cpdx and that of cftm. in esbl-producing bacteria, most agents showed an mic90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory mic values. in methi- cillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, cfdn and cxd showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. the frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. esbl-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be  readily evaluated. however, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. in s. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the pk/pd theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the pk/pd theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.

TI  == antibiotic prophylaxis and non-group b streptococcal neonatal sepsis.
AB  == objective: to assess the effect of increased use of intravenous penicillin for group b streptococcus (streptococcus agalactiae, gbs) antibiotic prophylaxis on non-gbs neonatal sepsis and antibiotic resistance. methods: we undertook a nonconcurrent cohort study. microbiology cultures originating from infants with early-onset neonatal sepsis in our neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) from 1992  to 1999 were reviewed. prevalence of non-gbs neonatal sepsis in the control period (january 1, 1992, through june 30, 1995) was compared with that in the study period (october 1, 1995, through august 31, 1999), when the protocol changed. chi-squared or fisher exact tests were used to determine statistical significance. resistance patterns were compared in similar fashion. results: the  prevalence of non-gbs neonatal sepsis was 1.2 per 1,000 (36 of 31,133) live births before and 1.1 per 1,000 (32 of 28,733) live births after institution of the centers for disease control and prevention culture-based protocol (p = .97).  our power analysis assumed a doubling in the rate of non-gbs sepsis and required  21,220 live births per arm. gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis prevalences were not significantly different. escherichia coli and gbs resistance patterns did not change. conclusion: institution of a protocol for gbs antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreased the rate of gbs neonatal sepsis but did not increase the rate of non-gbs neonatal sepsis. antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms were not affected.

TI  == structural characterization of sialic acid synthase by electrospray mass spectrometry--a tetrameric enzyme composed of dimeric dimers.
AB  == sialic acid synthase (neub) encoded by the neub gene catalyzes the condensation of n-acetylmannosamine and phospho(enol)pyruvate to form n-acetylneuraminic acid. the enzyme is essential for the biosynthesis of polysialic acid, a capsular sugar polymer functioning as a virulent factor and antiphagocytic barrier. this report  demonstrates the first characterization on the quaternary structure of neub from  escherichia coli (ecneub) and streptococcus agalactiae (saneub) by nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms). under non-denaturing conditions, tris buffer was observed to induce a higher ratio of tetramer/dimer of neub in the esi mass spectra, providing supportive evidence for the existence  of a "structurally-specific" tetramer. the instrument parameters were found to significantly affect the ratio of detected tetramer/dimer in esi mass spectra. the harshest conditions, including high desolvation voltages and pressure in the  collision cell, led to enhanced detection of the 160 kda tetramer. the prevalence of dimeric form is likely the cause in loss of tetramer stability in gas-phase arising from insufficient collisional cooling, which implies an asymmetric assembly, possibly composed of dimeric dimers. most interestingly, the hypothesis was further supported by chemical cross-linking of saneub, in which the reaction  of shorter linker yielded mainly the dimer whereas that of longer linker produced both dimer and tetramer. furthermore, the esi-ms analysis can reflect dramatic change of ph-dependent quaternary structure in association with enzyme activity,  suggesting the tetrameric form may be the primary species responsible for the enzyme catalysis.

TI  == influence of modified natural and synthetic surfactant preparations on bacterial  killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
AB  == in addition to its biophysical functions, surfactant plays an important role in pulmonary host defense. in this investigation we studied the influence of various commercially available surfactants on the phagocytosis of bacteria that are common pathogens in the neonatal period. group b streptococci (gbs), escherichia  coli and staphylococcus aureus were cultured with isolated human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn) and non-specific serum in the presence or absence of different modified natural (curosurf, alveofact, survanta) or totally  synthetic, protein-free surfactant preparations (exosurf, pumactant). prior to and after 30 and 60 min of incubation with pmn at different surfactant concentrations (1, 10 or 20 mg/ml), the number of viable bacteria was determined  by colony counting. killing of s. aureus by pmn was not influenced by any of the  surfactants. alveofact and curosurf had no significant negative impact on phagocytosis. at 20 mg/ml, curosurf even reduced the number of viable e. coli. survanta at 10 and 20 mg/ml and exosurf at all concentrations impaired the killing of non-encapsulated gbs and e. coli. pumactant at 1-20 mg/ml interfered with the phagocytosis of e. coli. in further experiments we demonstrated that curosurf did not interfere with the phagocytosis of an encapsulated gbs-strain opsonised by a specific antiserum either. in additional experiments we analysed the influence of the different surfactants on the release of reactive oxygen metabolite by pmn and found that the changes in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction did not necessarily correlate with the findings of the studies on killing. in conclusion, we found that killing by pmn was influenced by the bacterial species  and the composition and concentration of the different surfactant preparations. the strongest impairment in phagocytic function of pmn was observed with the protein-free synthetic surfactant exosurf, a phospholipid preparation that contains the alcohols hexadecanol and tyloxapol as spreading agents.

TI  == removal of group b streptococci colonizing the vagina and oropharynx of mice with a bacteriophage lytic enzyme.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are the leading cause of neonatal meningitis and sepsis worldwide. the current treatment strategy is limited to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in pregnant women to prevent early-onset neonatal diseases, but considering the potential for antibiotic resistance, the risk of losing control over the disease is high. to approach this problem, we have developed a bacteriophage (phage) lytic enzyme to remove colonizing gbs. bacteriophage muralytic enzymes, termed lysins, are highly evolved molecules designed to degrade the cell wall of host bacteria to release phage particles from the bacterial cytoplasm. several different lysins have been developed to specifically kill bacterial pathogens both on mucosal surfaces and in blood and represent a novel approach to control infection. a lysin cloned from a phage infecting gbs was found to contain two putative catalytic domains and one putative binding domain, which is similar to the domain organization of some staphylococcal phage lysins. the lysin (named plygbs) was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli, and purified plygbs efficiently killed all tested gbs serotypes in vitro. in a mouse model, a single dose of plygbs significantly reduced bacterial colonization in both the vagina and oropharynx. as an alternative strategy for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, this approach may be used to reduce vaginal gbs colonization in pregnant women before delivery or to decontaminate newborns, thus reducing the incidence of gbs-associated neonatal meningitis and sepsis.

TI  == prevention of neonatal group b streptococcal disease: progress, challenges and dilemmas.
AB  == significant advances in the prevention of neonatal group b streptococcal (gbs) disease have occurred in the last decade. in australia, as well as in centres overseas, intrapartum penicillin given to carrier mothers has been shown to unequivocally decrease early onset neonatal gbs sepsis. in choosing which women should receive intrapartum chemoprophylaxis, recent data suggest that screening programmes for the detection of gbs carriage may be more effective than risk-based strategies to prevent early onset neonatal gbs sepsis. combined vaginal and rectal swabs, collected between 35 and 37 weeks gestation, either by  a health care worker or by the patient herself and inoculated onto selective media after enrichment provide the optimum conditions to detect carriage. increasingly erythromycin and clindamycin resistance is being described overseas, which may influence the choice of antibiotics used in those allergic to penicillin. widespread antibiotic use, particularly with broad-spectrum agents, may lead to increasing neonatal sepsis with ampicillin resistant organisms. whilst rates of non-gbs neonatal sepsis are generally stable there is evidence suggesting that escherichia coli sepsis in premature infants is increasing. novel vaccination strategies for gbs are being developed that may ultimately provide broader protection for mothers and babies and eliminate the need for intrapartum  antibiotics.

TI  == chemoenzymatic synthesis of cmp-sialic acid derivatives by a one-pot two-enzyme system: comparison of substrate flexibility of three microbial cmp-sialic acid synthetases.
AB  == three c terminal his6-tagged recombinant microbial cmp-sialic acid synthetases [ec 2.7.7.43] cloned from neisseria meningitidis group b, streptococcus agalactiae serotype v, and escherichia coli k1, respectively, were evaluated for  their ability in the synthesis of cmp-sialic acid derivatives in a one-pot two-enzyme system. in this system, n-acetylmannosamine or mannose analogs were condensed with pyruvate, catalyzed by a recombinant sialic acid aldolase [ec 4.1.3.3] cloned from e. coli k12 to provide sialic acid analogs as substrates for the cmp-sialic acid synthetases. the substrate flexibility and the reaction efficiency of the three recombinant cmp-sialic acid synthetases were compared, first by qualitative screening using thin layer chromatography, and then by quantitative analysis using high performance liquid chromatography. the n. meningitidis synthetase was shown to have the highest expression level, the most  flexible substrate specificity, and the highest catalytic efficiency among the three synthetases. finally, eight sugar nucleotides, including cytidine 5'-monophosphate n-acetylneuraminic acid (cmp-neu5ac) and its derivatives with substitutions at carbon-5, carbon-8, or carbon-9 of neu5ac, were synthesized in a preparative (100-200 mg) scale from their 5- or 6-carbon sugar precursors using the n. meningitidis synthetase and the aldolase.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16srrna genes pcr amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == bacterial capsular polysaccharide and sugar transferases.
AB  == capsular polysaccharides (cps) of several pathogenic bacteria are thought to be good materials for the development of new therapeutic reagents. these polysaccharides can be used as vaccines against infection of pathogenic bacteria  and are also useful as inhibitors for disease caused by aberrant and abnormal cell-cell interaction, such as cancer metastasis and inflammation. since bacterial cps are diverse in structure and these bacteria have a variety of sugar transferases responsible for the synthesis of cps, bacterial cp synthesis (cps) genes have attracted much interest as a source of glycosyltransferases useful for glycoengineering. in this review, we describe physiological effects of the bacterial cps on mammalian cells, and the structure and function of the cps genes, by focusing on group b streptococci, streptococcus agalactiae type ia and  ib, that produce high-molecular weight polysaccharides consisting of the following pentasaccharide repeating units: -->4)-[alpha-d-neupnac-(2-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)]-beta-d -galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcp-(1--> and -->4)-[alpha-d-neupnac-(2-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)]-beta-d -galp-(1-->4)beta-d-glcp-(1-->, respectively.

AB  == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the  use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen  was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995  to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

AB  == background: dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (dds) is the clinical phenomenon of  acute neurologic symptoms attributed to cerebral edema that occurs during or following intermittent hemodialysis (hd). we describe a case of dds-induced cerebral edema that resulted in irreversible brain injury and death following acute hd and review the relevant literature of the association of dds and hd. case presentation: a 22-year-old male with obstructive uropathy presented to hospital with severe sepsis syndrome secondary to pneumonia. laboratory investigations included a ph of 6.95, paco2 10 mmhg, hco3 2 mmol/l, serum sodium  132 mmol/l, serum osmolality 330 mosmol/kg, and urea 130 mg/dl (46.7 mmol/l). diagnostic imaging demonstrated multifocal pneumonia, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening. during hd the patient became progressively obtunded. repeat laboratory investigations showed ph 7.36, hco3 19 mmol/l, potassium 1.8 mmol/l, and urea 38.4 mg/dl (13.7 mmol/l) (urea-reduction-ratio 71%). following hd, spontaneous movements were absent with no pupillary or brainstem reflexes. head ct-scan showed diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of basal cisterns and  generalized loss of gray-white differentiation. brain death was declared. conclusions: death is a rare consequence of dds in adults following hd. several features may have predisposed this patient to dds including: central nervous system adaptations from chronic kidney disease with efficient serum urea removal  and correction of serum hyperosmolality; severe cerebral intracellular acidosis;  relative hypercapnea; and post-hd hemodynamic instability with compounded cerebral ischemia.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

AB  == a group b streptococcal (gbs) bacteriophage lysin gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the purified recombinant enzyme, calculated to have a molecular mass of 49 677 da, lysed gbs cells. the susceptibility of gbs cells to  lysis by the enzyme depended upon the growth stage at which they were harvested,  with early exponential phase cells most sensitive. calcium ions enhanced the activity of the enzyme. the enzyme also lysed other beta-haemolytic streptococci, including groups a, c, e and g streptococci, but not common oral streptococci, including streptococcus mutans. the generation of both reducing activity and n-terminal alanine residues during lysis indicated that the lysin is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing both glycosidase and endopeptidase activities. this is consistent with the presence of two conserved sequence domains, an acm (acetylmuramidase) domain associated with lysozyme activity, and a chap (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases) domain associated with endopeptidase activity. site-directed mutagenesis of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the chap domain and conserved aspartate and glutamate residues in the acm domain confirmed their importance for lysozyme and endopeptidase activity respectively.

TI  == ten-year study on the effect of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on early onset group b streptococcal and escherichia coli neonatal sepsis in australasia.
AB  == background: intrapartum antibiotics have reduced the incidence of neonatal early  onset (eo) group b streptococcal (gbs) disease. some surveillance data suggest that this success may be at the cost of increasing rates of non-gbs infection, especially in premature neonates. objective: to examine rates of eogbs infection  and eo escherichia coli neonatal sepsis in australasia. methodology: analysis of  trends in eo (<48 h age) gbs and e. coli sepsis from longitudinal prospective surveillance data collected from representative tertiary obstetric hospitals in each state of australia and selected centers in new zealand during a 10-year period from 1992 through 2001. statistical analysis used poisson regression. results: 206 gbs and 96 e. coli cases occurred in 298,319 live births during the  study period. the eogbs sepsis rate fell from a peak of 1.43/1000 live births in  1993 to 0.25/1000 in 2001 (p < 0.001). the overall eo e. coli sepsis rate was 0.32/1000. in babies with birth weight <1500 g, it was 6.20/1000. there was an overall trend to decreasing eo e. coli sepsis (p = 0.07), and there was no significant change in e. coli sepsis in babies <1500 g (p = 0.60). sixty-nine percent of e. coli cases occurred in the <1500 g cohort; the case fatality rate in this group was 50%. the overall case fatality rate from e. coli sepsis was 36%, and this rate remained stable during the study period (p = 0.47). conclusions: the increasing use of intrapartum antibiotics produced a steady decline in eogbs disease in australasia. there was also a trend to decreasing eo  e. coli sepsis in all babies, and the rate in very low birth weight infants remained stable.

TI  == cloning, overexpression, and characterization of a serine/threonine protein kinase pkni from mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv.
AB  == protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation is the principal mechanism for translation of external signals into cellular responses. eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases have been reported to play important roles in bacterial  development and/or virulence. the pkni protein is one of the 11 eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases in mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv. from the bioinformatic studies, pkni protein has been shown to have an n-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a transmembrane region and an extracellular c-terminus suggestive of a sensor molecule. in this study, we have cloned, overexpressed, and characterized the entire coding region and the cytoplasmic domain of pkni as a fusion protein with an n-terminal histidine tag, and used immobilized metal affinity chromatography for purification of recombinant proteins. the purified recombinant proteins were found to be functionally active  through in vitro phosphorylation assay and phosphoamino acid analysis. in vitro kinase assay of both proteins revealed that pkni is capable of autophosphorylation and showed manganese-dependent activity. phosphoamino acid analysis indicated phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues. southern blot analysis with genomic dna highlighted the conserved nature of pkni among the various mycobacterial species. in silico analysis revealed a close homology of pkni to stk1 from streptococcus agalactiae, shown to have a role in virulence and cell segregation of the organism.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in infants: the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognostic factors.
AB  == this 16-year (1986-2001) retrospective study enrolled 80 infantile patients (aged, 30-365 days old) with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. the most prevalent pathogens were salmonellaspecies, streptococcus (s.) agalactiae, escherichia (e.) coli, and haemophilus (h.) influenzae, accounting for about 59%  of the episodes. meningitis caused by salmonella species, e. coli and h. influenzae occurs more often in the older infants, while that caused by s. agalactiae occurs more often in young infants. our study revealed a decrease in the proportion of salmonella meningitis from 27% in the first 8 years to 9% in the second 8 years with e. coli replacing salmonella species as the leading pathogen of this disease during the second period. overall mortality rate for both periods of time was 11%. however, if we take those with undesirable poor outcomes into account, 43% of patients could be considered treatment failures. the study also reveals a high prevalence of neurological complications when this  disease is caused by h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and salmonella species. stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only initial changing levels  of consciousness (p = 0.006) were independently associated with treatment failure. the most frequent neurological complications associated with this disease included subdural empyema, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarctions, and seizures. because therapeutic regimens may require attention to the eradication of bacterial pathogen but also the neurological complications, early diagnosis and choice of appropriate antibiotics are essential to increasing the possibility of survival.

TI  == comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme m and  p.
AB  == lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme m and p, but only the m enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. disruption of the lysozyme m locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a gram-negative bacterium. unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme m-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. muramidase activity in lysozyme m-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme p mrna and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. the muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme p was less than that of recombinant m lysozyme. recombinant p lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme m to achieve the same level of killing. the lower antimicrobial activity of p lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by p lysozyme in lysozyme m-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. recombinant lysozyme m and p were equally effective in killing selected gram-positive organisms. this outcome suggests that disruption of both m and p loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == the neuc protein of escherichia coli k1 is a udp n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase.
AB  == the k1 capsule is an essential virulence determinant of escherichia coli strains  that cause meningitis in neonates. biosynthesis and transport of the capsule, an  alpha-2,8-linked polymer of sialic acid, are encoded by the 17-kb kps gene cluster. we deleted neuc, a k1 gene implicated in sialic acid synthesis, from the chromosome of ev36, a k-12-k1 hybrid, by allelic exchange. exogenously added sialic acid restored capsule expression to the deletion strain (deltaneuc), confirming that neuc is necessary for sialic acid synthesis. the deduced amino acid sequence of neuc showed similarities to those of udp-n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) 2-epimerases from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. the neuc homologue from serotype iii streptococcus agalactiae complements deltaneuc. we cloned the neuc gene into an intein expression vector to facilitate purification. we demonstrated by paper chromatography that the purified neuc gene product catalyzed the formation of [2-(14)c]acetamidoglucal and [n-(14)c]acetylmannosamine (mannac) from udp-[(14)c]glcnac. the formation of reaction intermediate 2-acetamidoglucal with the concomitant release of udp was confirmed by proton and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. neuc  could not use glcnac as a substrate. these data suggest that neuc encodes an epimerase that catalyzes the formation of mannac from udp-glcnac via a 2-acetamidoglucal intermediate. the unexpected release of the glucal intermediate and the extremely low rate of mannac formation likely were a result of the in vitro assay conditions, in which a key regulatory molecule or protein was absent.

TI  == a gapc chimera retains the properties of the streptococcus uberis wild-type gapc  protein.
AB  == the gapc products of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus uberis share considerable homology at the dna and amino acid levels. the high similarity at the protein level suggests that one gapc protein might be used as a single antigen to protect dairy cows against infections with the contagious s. agalactiae and the environmental s. dysgalactiae and s. uberis  strains. despite their similarities, immunization with the s. dysgalactiae gapc did not protect dairy cows from a challenge with s. uberis, suggesting the presence of regions in gapc that are involved in species-specific protection. to  produce a single antigen that can be used to protect against all streptococcal mastitis infections, we constructed a gapc chimeric protein using the s. uberis gapc product as the backbone followed by non-conserved peptide regions from the s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae gapc proteins. we report that the chimeric gapc protein retains the enzymatic activity of the s. uberis gapc protein. in addition, we fused the chimera to the ompf and lipof transport sequences of escherichia coli and the gapc chimeras were present in membrane fractions of e. coli. these extracts could be the basis of an antigen preparation for use in mastitis vaccines.

TI  == [cost benefit analysis of body surface cultures at a neonatal unit].
AB  == introduction: infection continues to be a cause of concern in neonatal units. the high cost of the body surface cultures used to study infection and their limited  utility is controversial. material and methods: the medical records of newborns admitted for suspected infection in 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. request criteria, cost, and the clinical utility of body surface cultures were analyzed.  results: in 1999, body surface cultures were requested in 204 newborns admitted to hospital (70 % of all admitted newborns). of these, six were diagnosed with bacteremia (6.23/1000; 95 % ci: 5.9-6.5). the most frequently isolated microorganisms were escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the total cost of body surface cultures was 6,510.95 euros (1,083,331 pesetas). in 25 % of cases the results of cultures influenced clinical decision making. the cost necessary to obtain clinical repercussion in a patient was 191.50 euros (31,863 pesetas). requesting two body surface cultures only (otic and umbilical) halved the cost without diminishing their clinical utility. conclusions: a considerable percentage of newborns admitted to hospital present suspected infection requiring microbiological studies. although the cost of body surface cultures is high, the  results of these cultures influence diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in a quarter of patients. we do not believe that eliminating the use of these cultures would be beneficial. however, their cost can be reduced by carefully selecting request criteria and by limiting cultures to two samples (otic and umbilical).

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

TI  == effects of antenatal antibiotics on the incidence and bacteriological profile of  early-onset neonatal sepsis. a retrospective study over five years.
AB  == background: recommendations for the use of antenatal antibiotics have been widely implemented in the past few years, notably to prevent group b streptococcal disease or to prolong pregnancy in the case of preterm premature rupture of the membranes. objectives: we designed a retrospective study to assess the potential  effects of this increasing use of antibiotics on the incidence and bacteriological profile of early-onset neonatal sepsis (eons). methods: all neonates referred to our department for suspected eons from january 1 1995 through december 31 1999 were included. antenatal antibiotic exposure together with clinical and microbiological data from the neonatal period were gathered and analyzed on a yearly basis. results: of the 485 newborns who met the inclusion criteria, there were 101 cases of culture-confirmed sepsis; 339 cases of suspected sepsis and 69 cases of confirmed sepsis involved children born in the hospital, among a total of 16,627 live births registered in our center over the study period. the overall incidence of eons dropped from 6.8 to 0.6/1,000 births  between 1995 and 1999 (p < 0.001), but the rate of group b streptococcal infection decreased much more rapidly than that of non-group b streptococcal infection. we observed a trend towards the emergence of ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli strains, which were isolated in seven cases. among e. coli infections, ampicillin resistance was statistically linked with antenatal antibiotic use (p = 0.025). we also delineated several risk factors associated with these infections. conclusion: in our center, antenatal antibiotic treatment  was effective in reducing the incidence of eons, but this benefit may come at the cost of favoring the emergence of ampicillin-resistant organisms causing severe neonatal infections. antenatal and postnatal antibiotic treatment strategies should take this adverse effect into account.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == bacteriocin-like substance (bls) production in aeromonas hydrophila water isolates.
AB  == 30 aeromonas hydrophila water isolates were tested for bacteriocin-like substance (bls) production using a target panel of closely related microorganisms and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. a. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity against one or more indicator microorganisms, but the activity emerged only with non-phylogenetically related genera or species. in particular all a. hydrophila showed antibacterial activity  against one or more of the tested staphylococcus strains, five against listeria spp. (listeria seeligeri, listeria welshimeri and listeria ivanovii), and eight presented a weak antagonistic activity towards streptococcus agalactiae and lactobacillus spp. inhibitory activity was not observed against the other gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterococcus spp.) and gram-negative tested strains, including aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae and the same a. hydrophila, when used as indicator. anti-staphylococcal activity  was observed with a gradual increase of the inhibition zone during incubation and seemed to be influenced by a. hydrophila hemolytic expression. extrachromosomal analysis showed the presence, in 70% of the strains, of one to five plasmids with molecular masses ranging from 2.1 to 41.5 mda, but it was not possible to relate  this result with bls production.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  == as the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (banan), mics of cefpodoxime (cpdx, an active form of banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22  species from 15 medical institutions all over japan from june 2000 to march 2001  were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the japanese society of chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. in this study, remarkable change in the activity of cpdx was observed in streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus  influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before banan was launched. this cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated  in 1989 when banan was launched. other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. however, cpdx showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against prsp. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and moraxella catarrhalis, cpdx also showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its  marketing. against quinolones-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, cpdx showed excellent activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml. against members of the family  enterobacteriaceae except for citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, cpdx showed good activity. however, in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. proteus spp., and providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including cpdx. against peptostreptococcus spp., mic90 of cpdx was 8 micrograms/ml and its mic range was  widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml, which were similar to those in  the studies before its marketing. in this study, cpdx showed the decrease in the  activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, cpdx maintained good activity. furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.

TI  == cloning, over-expression, purification, and characterisation of n-acetylneuraminate synthase from streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == n-acetylneuraminate synthase (neuac-synthase; e.c. 4.1.3.19) is one of the two enzymes responsible for sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid) synthesis in bacteria. potential genes encoding neuac synthase in streptococcus agalactiae and bacillus subtilis were identified from a blast search of the embl/genbank/ddbj database using the e. coli neub gene sequence as a probe and the genes cloned and expressed at high level in escherichia coli. the neub gene of s. agalactiae was shown to encode an active neuac synthase, whereas the spse gene product from b. subtilis did not have this activity. expression of the native s. agalactiae neub  gene product enzyme in e. coli resulted in a product that was prone to proteolysis during purification so the protein was tagged with a hexa-histidine tag at its n-terminus and the enzyme was rapidly purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate fractionation and ni-chelating affinity chromatography in two steps. measurement of the subunit molecular mass by electrospray ionisation mass  spectrometry (m(r) = 38, 987 +/- 3) and of the native molecular mass by gel filtration chromatography (m(r) = 78,000) clearly demonstrated that the enzyme is dimeric. the effects of edta, temperature, and ph on the activity of the s. agalactiae neuac synthase were examined. enzyme activity was maximal at ph 7 and  was dependent on the presence of metal ions such as mg(2+), mn(2+) or co(2+). the purified enzyme was inhibited by the reagent phenylglyoxal and the substrates n-acetyl mannosamine or phosphoenol pyruvate afforded protection against this inhibition, suggesting that one or more arginine residues are involved in substrate recognition and binding. the ease of expression and the properties of the enzyme should now permit a thorough study of the specificity of the enzyme and provide the prerequisites for attempts to alter this specificity by directed  evolution for the production of novel sialic acid analogues.

TI  == wound erysipelas following appendectomy caused by group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus (streptococcus agalactiae).
AB  == background: case description of a patient who developed erysipelas of the surgical wound following appendectomy for acute appendicitis, and literature review of invasive group b streptococcal infections. methods: a 65-year-old man with perforated appendicitis underwent urgent appendectomy and drainage. antibiotic prophylaxis with tobramycin (100 mg) and metronidazole (500 mg) was administered. at surgery, a phlegmon was identified with free perforation of the  appendix and purulent peritoneal fluid. appendectomy, irrigation with 0.9% nacl solution, and drainage with a silastic closed-suction drain was performed. a literature search in all languages was performed using medline, using the search  terms surgical site infection, wound infection, group b streptococcus, streptococcus agalactiae, necrotizing fasciitis, and postoperative infection. results: erysipelas of the surgical wound developed on the fourth postoperative day. intravenous penicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were administered empirically. culture of the wound drainage identified streptococcus agalactiae and a few colonies of escherichia coli. the broad-spectrum antibiotic was discontinued, and a 10-day course of penicillin was completed. conclusions: erysipelas of the surgical wound is unusual, and infection with group b streptococci is rare compared with infection by group a streptococci. streptococcus agalactiae is recognized to be increasingly virulent, with an increasing predilection for bacteremic infections in healthy hosts. although streptococcus agalactiae remains highly susceptible to antimicrobial agents effective against gram-positive cocci, the changing epidemiology and potentially  invasive nature of these infections should have clinicians alert to the possibility of infection caused by group b streptococci.

TI  == [role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. the participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of uti; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. to gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in uti. methods: a total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low uti were analyzed. samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and mcconkey agar, as well as hbt medium for g. vaginalis, and u9b broth and agar e broth for m. hominis and u. urealyticum. the following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. results. there were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. microorganisms  associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): g. vaginalis (25.7%), u. urealyticum (5.9%), s. agalactiae (3.4%) and m. hominis (2%). uti were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and  in diabetic patients. conclusions: microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the  need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of uti.

TI  == [prognostic and therapeutic value of biologic signs of infection in the management of preterm labor (amniocentesis excepted)].
AB  == during threatened preterm delivery, both general and local signs of infection increase the risks of amniotic infection, premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and neonatal and/or maternal morbidity of infectious origin. nonetheless, as antibiotics have not been sufficiently studied to be proved of benefit in chorioamnionitis with intact membranes, search for these general (c reactive protein, hyperleucocytosis) or cervical/vaginal (group b streptococcus,  escherichia coli, bacterial vaginosis) signs of infection have not been proved to be really necessary. we have to except group b streptococcus, which have to be searched during weeks that precede delivery: in those cases where it is shown to  be present in the cervix or the vagina, antibiotics must be prescribed during delivery (anaes recommendation). finally, it must be emphasized that these recommendations are mainly based on the absence of studies specifically done to prove the benefits or risks of antenatal antibiotics - or fetal extraction - in case of chorioamnionitis with intact membranes. systematic vaginal and blood samples (crp, leukocytes, vaginal micro-organisms) would be helpful in determining the appropriate option in those situations.

TI  == chlorhexidine vaginal flushings versus systemic ampicillin in the prevention of vertical transmission of neonatal group b streptococcus, at term.
AB  == objective: to investigate the efficacy of intrapartum vaginal flushings with chlorhexidine compared with ampicillin in preventing group b streptococcus transmission to neonates. methods: this was a randomized controlled study, including singleton pregnancies delivering vaginally. rupture of membranes, when  present, must not have occurred more than 6 h previously. women with any gestational complication, with a newborn previously affected by group b streptococcus sepsis or whose cervical dilatation was greater than 5 cm were excluded. a total of 244 group b streptococcus-colonized mothers at term (screened at 36-38 weeks) were randomized to receive either 140 ml chlorhexidine  0.2% by vaginal flushings every 6 h or ampicillin 2 g intravenously every 6 h until delivery. neonatal swabs were taken at birth, at three different sites (nose, ear and gastric juice). results: a total of 108 women were treated with ampicillin and 109 with chlorhexidine. their ages and gestational weeks at delivery were similar in the two groups. nulliparous women were equally distributed between the two groups (ampicillin, 87%; chlorhexidine, 89%). clinical data such as birth weight (ampicillin, 3,365 +/- 390 g; chlorhexidine, 3,440 +/- 452 g), apgar scores at 1 min (ampicillin, 8.4 +/- 0.9; chlorhexidine,  8.2 +/- 1.4) and at 5 min (ampicillin, 9.7 +/- 0.6; chlorhexidine, 9.6 +/- 1.1) were similar for the two groups, as was the rate of neonatal group b streptococcus colonization (chlorhexidine, 15.6%; ampicillin, 12%). escherichia coli, on the other hand, was significantly more prevalent in the ampicillin (7.4%) than in the chlorhexidine group (1.8%, p < 0.05). six neonates were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, including two cases of early-onset sepsis (one in each group). conclusions: in this carefully screened target population, intrapartum vaginal flushings with chlorhexidine in colonized  mothers display the same efficacy as ampicillin in preventing vertical transmission of group b streptococcus. moreover, the rate of neonatal e. coli colonization was reduced by chlorhexidine.

TI  == trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance of early-onset sepsis: population-based surveillance in san francisco and atlanta.
AB  == objective: although increased use of intrapartum antibiotics caused significant declines in early-onset group b streptococcus (gbs) infection, the effect on infections caused by other pathogens is not clear. the objective of this study was to determine trends in the incidence of early-onset sepsis caused by organisms other than group b streptococcus in the era of antimicrobial prophylaxis. methods: we conducted surveillance for early-onset sepsis as part of the active bacterial core surveillance. a case was defined as isolation of bacteria from blood or cerebrospinal fluid from an infant who was 0 to 6 days of  age and born in the surveillance area during 1998 through 2000 (248 184 births).  results: we identified 408 cases of early-onset infection. gbs caused 166 (40.7%) cases (52 in 1998, 51 in 1999, and 63 in 2000 for incidences 0.62, 0.62, and 0.76 cases per 1000 live births, respectively). other bacterial pathogens were identified in 242 cases (82 in 1998, 79 in 1999, and 81 in 2000 for incidences 0.99, 0.95, and 0.98 per 1000 live births, respectively) of early-onset sepsis. escherichia coli caused 70 cases (0.25, 0.28, and 0.31 cases per 1000 live births, respectively, in 1998-2000). the proportion of e coli infections that were resistant to ampicillin increased significantly among preterm infants from 29% (2 of 7) in 1998 to 84% (16 of 18) in 2000 but not in full-term infants: 50%  (4 of 8) in 1998 and 25% (1 of 4) in 2000. conclusions: whereas rates of early-onset sepsis caused by gbs and other pathogens were low and did not change  significantly during the study period, antibiotic-resistant e coli infections among preterm infants increased. overall, these trends are reassuring, but careful evaluation of the increase in resistant infections in very young infants  is critical in the future.

TI  == perinatal antibiotic usage and changes in colonization and resistance rates of group b streptococcus and other pathogens.
AB  == objective: to quantify current antibiotic usage during the perinatal period and impact on vaginal-rectal colonizing organism resistance rates. methods: swabs were obtained for culture of group b streptococcus and other bacteria from a cohort of 1207 pregnant women in calgary, alberta, at 36 weeks' gestation. those  women who received antibiotics during labor or after pregnancy and a 10% subset who received no antibiotics had repeat cultures at 6 weeks postpartum. cultured organisms were tested for sensitivity to several antibiotics. results: group b streptococcus was identified in 235 women (19.5%) in the antepartum period. fifty-one percent of all participants received antibiotics (31.4% intrapartum). group b streptococcus prophylaxis was given to 215 (17.8%), whereas 83 (6.9%) group b streptococcus-negative women without fever during labor received antibiotics. ampicillin (49%), cefazolin (28%), and penicillin (18%) were the most frequently used antibiotics. resistance rates among group b streptococcus to erythromycin and clindamycin were 5.6% and 3.0%, respectively, whereas 20.6% of escherichia coli were ampicillin resistant. among antibiotic recipients, 6.3% of  all bacteria that were initially sensitive on prenatal cultures to a specific antibiotic became resistant in the postnatal period, whereas 6.5% that were initially resistant became sensitive. conclusion: current prevention practices in our region were associated with perinatal antibiotic administration in over half  of pregnant women. ampicillin was the most common antibiotic administered. some physicians are treating women who are group b streptococcus culture negative at term, a practice that is of no proven value. however, this was not associated with increased resistance for group b streptococcus or other organisms identified from maternal vaginal-rectal tracts.

AB  == objective: to compare the effect of meconium staining on the growth rate of escherichia coli and group b streptococci (gbs) in amniotic fluid. study design:  sterile meconium was added in different concentrations to pooled sterile amniotic fluid obtained from term mothers. meconium concentration was equal to: 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 mg meconium/ml amniotic fluid. amniotic fluid was quantitatively inoculated with e. coli and gbs type ii and type iii organisms (10(3) organisms/ml). clear amniotic fluid and todd-hewitt broth served as controls. growth rates of organisms were measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after inoculation. results: clear amniotic fluid was completely inhibitory for growth of e. coli even after 24 hours of incubation. in contrast, after 6 hours of incubation, significantly increased growth of gbs occurred (10(5) organisms/ml) (p<0.0001). the inhibitory effect on e. coli was observed even with meconium concentration of up to 1.5 mg/ml. in contrast, even the smallest concentration of meconium (1 mg/ml) resulted in a 2-log fold increase of gbs within 4 hours. the more rapid growth rate of gbs compared to e. coli persisted even at moderate staining of amniotic fluid (6 mg/ml) in the first 8 hours of incubation (p<0.005). in the presence of thick meconium (12 mg/ml), during the first 6 hours of incubation, the growth rates of gbs and e. coli were nearly similar. conclusions: gbs (type ii and iii) growth, in contrast to e. coli, was less inhibited by amniotic fluid, occurred at a more rapid rate, and was enhanced at lower concentrations of meconium. as such, the presence of even light meconium staining in cases of rupture of membranes of even less than 6 hours in a mother who is a gbs carrier should be considered as a risk factor for the development of perinatal gbs infection.

TI  == changes in pathogens causing early-onset sepsis in very-low-birth-weight infants.
AB  == background: it is uncertain whether the rates and causes of early-onset sepsis (that occurring within 72 hours after birth) among very-low-birth-weight infants  have changed in recent years, since antibiotics have begun to be used more widely during labor and delivery. methods: we studied 5447 very-low-birth-weight infants (those weighing between 401 and 1500 g) born at centers of the neonatal research  network of the national institute of child health and human development between 1998 and 2000 who had at least one blood culture in the first three days of life  and compared them with 7606 very-low-birth-weight infants born at centers in the  network between 1991 and 1993. results: early-onset sepsis (as confirmed by positive blood cultures) was present in 84 infants in the more recent birth cohort (1.5 percent). as compared with the earlier birth cohort, there was a marked reduction in group b streptococcal sepsis (from 5.9 to 1.7 per 1000 live births of infants weighing 401 to 1500 g, p<0.001) and an increase in escherichia coli sepsis (from 3.2 to 6.8 per 1000 live births, p=0.004); the overall rate of  early-onset sepsis was not significantly changed. most e. coli isolates from the  recent birth cohort (85 percent) were resistant to ampicillin, and mothers of infants with ampicillin-resistant e. coli infections were more likely to have received intrapartum ampicillin than were those with ampicillin-sensitive strains (26 of 28 with sensitivity data vs. 1 of 5, p=0.01). infants with early-onset sepsis were more likely to die than uninfected infants (37 percent vs. 13 percent, p<0.001), especially if they were infected with gram-negative organisms. conclusions: early-onset sepsis remains an uncommon but potentially lethal problem among very-low-birth-weight infants. the change in pathogens over time from predominantly gram-positive to predominantly gram-negative requires confirmation by ongoing surveillance.

AB  == the performance of two commercial chromogenic media for the isolation and presumptive identification of urinary tract pathogens, the cps id2 (biomerieux, france) and the chromagar orientation (bbl becton dickinson, usa), was evaluated  and compared with that of cystine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar and tryptic  soy agar with 5% sheep blood. the detection, determination of bacterial counts, and presumptive identification of bacteria causing urinary tract infections were  evaluated in 3,000 urine specimens. the two chromogenic media showed excellent correlation with the standard media for the detection and the bacterial count of  urinary pathogens. the escherichia coli strains produced the expected colour on the chromagar orientation and the cps id2 media in 99% and 90% of the cases, respectively. the klebsiella-enterobacter-citrobacter and the proteus-morganella-providencia groups were easily identified on both chromogenic  media, but further biochemical tests were needed to differentiate them to a species level. both media enabled the differentiation, with varying degrees of difficulty, of pseudomonas spp. strains from members of the family enterobacteriaceae. all isolates of enterococcus spp. were correctly identified and were easily distinguished from the streptococcus agalactiae isolates. staphylococcus saprophyticus isolates were easy to identify only on the chromagar orientation medium. no substantial difference was observed when comparing the results of the susceptibility tests, which were performed according to the standardized disk diffusion method as described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards, for colonies recovered from the blood agar versus  those recovered from the chromogenic media. in conclusion, the cps id2 and chromagar orientation media enabled excellent detection, count determination, and presumptive identification of urinary pathogens, both in pure and mixed cultures, and reliable and accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing directly from primary isolates. moreover, these media allowed a remarkable reduction in the workload and a significant savings of time. on the basis of their performance, these media can replace the standard primary plating media used in the routine diagnosis of urinary tract infections.

TI  == [neonatal meningitis. epidemiological study of the grupo de hospitales castrillo].
AB  == objectives: a prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcomes of vertically transmitted and nosocomial meningitis in neonates over a two-year period. patients and methods: cases of neonatal meningitis diagnosed between january 1, 1997 and december 31, 1998 in the neonatology departments of 28 acute-care hospitals in spain ("grupo de hospitales castrillo") were prospectively studied. bacteriological meningitis was considered confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid culture (csf) was positive for bacteria, virus or fungi, probable when csf culture was negative but blood culture was positive, and unconfirmed when both cultures were negative. results:  during the study period, 151 cases of meningitis were diagnosed. transmission was vertical in 84 cases and nosocomial in 67. the incidence of vertically transmitted meningitis was 0.51 of live births, and was significantly higher in very low birth weight (vlbw) infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 66 patients (78.6 %). no risk factors were identified in 46.4 % of the patients. group b streptococcus (agalactiae) was isolated in 48.5 % of cases  of confirmed meningitis and escherichia coli was isolated in 18.2 %. in 69.7 % of cases the results of blood culture were in agreement with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 8.3 %; mortality was significantly higher in vlbw  infants (33.3 % vs 4.2 % in infants weighing 1,500 g). thirteen percent of survivors had sequelae. the incidence of meningitis of nosocomial transmission was 0.2 % of admissions and was more frequent in vlbw infants. confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 49 patients (73.1 %). two or more risk factors were present in 62.7 % of patients. e. coli was isolated in 26.5 % of cases of nosocomial meningitis and staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in  24.5 %. in 55 % of patients the results of blood culture agreed with those of csf culture. the overall mortality rate was 19.4 %. mortality was significantly higher in vlbw infants and 18.5 % of survivors showed sequelae. conclusions: the  incidence, mortality and sequelae of neonatal meningitis in spain were similar to those reported in recent studies. the most commonly isolated pathogens were group b streptococcus in vertically transmitted meningitis and e. coli and s. epidermidis in nosocomial meningitis. we believe the distinction between vertical and nosocomial meningitis to be appropriate because the epidemiology of these diseases is different, which implies a different therapeutic approach. the high percentage of positive blood cultures indicates the need to include lumbar puncture whenever systemic infection is suspected in the neonatal period.

TI  == the effect of temperature on bactericidal properties of 10% povidone-iodine solution.
AB  == objective: ten percent povidone-iodine (pvi) is commonly used as a bactericidal solution before amniocentesis is performed. warming pvi may increase patient comfort; however, the effect of warming on its bactericidal properties is not known. the objective of this study was to determine the effect of warming 10% pvi on its bactericidal properties. study design: room temperature of pvi was 25 degrees c, and temperature in an ultrasonic gel warmer was 32 degrees c. in vitro experiments were conducted in 25 degrees c and 32 degrees c water baths. nine milliliters of pvi at each temperature was added to 1 ml of bacteria (10(7) organisms/ml staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus species, escherichia coli, group b streptococcus). after 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 minutes, 1-ml samples were removed and added to 4 ml of 0.5% sodium thiosulfate (to neutralize the iodine and interrupt bactericidal action). the number of viable organisms was determined by plating 0.1-ml samples on trypticase soy agar plates. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours and colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. for in vivo experiments in 40 volunteers, a 9-cm2 area of the dorsum of each hand was wiped with a sterile cotton swab to obtain a sample of bacteria for culture. the  area was then wiped for 15 seconds with pvi at 25 degrees c or 32 degrees c and recultured. the bactericidal properties of pvi at each temperature were compared. the mann-whitney u test was used as appropriate, and p <.05 was considered significant. results: in vitro, pvi was bactericidal against e coli, s aureus, enterococcus species, and group b streptococcus within 0.25 minutes at both 25 degrees c and 32 degrees c, with median bacterial growth of 0 cfu/plate for each  species of bacteria studied (3 replicates at each temperature). median bacterial  growth from skin was 4 cfu/plate (range, 0 to >100). after hands were wiped with  pvi at 25 degrees c and 32 degrees c, median bacterial growth was 0 cfu/plate (range, 0-8) and 0 cfu/plate (range, 0-15), respectively (not significant). conclusion: pvi is as effective at 32 degrees c as it is at 25 degrees c. use of  pvi at 32 degrees c should be considered to increase patient comfort in procedures performed without the use of anesthetics.

TI  == [profile and sensitivity to antibiotics of 2063 uropathogenic bacteria isolated in the center of tunisia].
AB  == current bacteriological data are very useful when making therapeutic decisions in cases of non complicated urinary tract infection. in this article, we present the data gathered by a university hospital laboratory in mid-tunisia as well as the results of 17,829 urinary cytobacteriological examinations conducted in a multidisciplinary hospital during the year 2000. urine was sowed on usual agar. all bacterium cultivating at least 10(5) bacteria reported to ml and at 37 degrees c in a normal atmosphere was retained; identification and sensitivity to  antibiotics of the bacterium followed the recommendations of the french society of microbiology. we collected 2063 non-redundant bacteria of which 82.3% came from female samples. gram negative rods were distinctly predominant with 92% of the whole bacterium and escherichia coli represented 67% of the whole of the germs; staphylococcus saprophyticus with 4.8% and streptococcus agalactiae with 1% dominated gram positive bacteria. the susceptibility of bacteria to the principal antibiotics used for the treatment of the urinary tract infection was characterised by the low percentage of sensitivity of the gram negative rods to amoxicillin (41.2% of sensitivity for escherichia coli and 22% for the proteus sp), and by cotrimoxazole which preserved an activity between 63.8% for escherichia coli and 94.7% for staphylococcus saprophyticus. the highest percentage of sensitivity was achieved by gentamicine (99.4% of escherichia coli  and 98.9% of staphylococcus saprophyticus) and fluoroquinolons (97.8% of escherichia coli and 100% of staphylococcus saprophyticus are sensible); furadoin was active on almost all escherichia coli and staphylococcus saprophyticus. apart from natural resistance, colistin was constantly active. escherichia coli and staphylococcus saprophyticus were the major agents of the urinary tract infection. gentamicin and fluoroquinolons showed themselves to be constantly active antibiotics. nitrofurans and colistin deserve a better place in therapeutic choice.

TI  == a glutamine transport gene, glnq, is required for fibronectin adherence and virulence of group b streptococci.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. gbs adhere to fibronectin when it is attached to a solid phase. we isolated a tn917 transposon mutant, coh1-gt1, which shows decreased adherence to fibronectin. coh1-gt1 also shows decreased adherence to and invasion of respiratory epithelial cells in vitro and decreased virulence in vivo. coh1-gt1 contains a tn917 insertion in a homolog of glnq, a gene from escherichia coli which is required for glutamine transport and codes for a cytoplasmic atp-binding cassette protein. to confirm that the decreased fibronectin adherence of coh1-gt1 was due to the mutation in glnq, we constructed coh1-gt2, a strain with a nonpolar site-directed mutation in glnq. coh1-gt2 showed decreased binding to fibronectin. we also demonstrated that complementation of glnq in trans restored  fibronectin adherence to coh1-gt1. coh1-gt1 shows decreased uptake of radiolabeled glutamine and is resistant to the toxic glutamine analog gamma-l-glutamylhydrazide, demonstrating that the glnq gene is required for glutamine transport in gbs. glnq lacks a signal sequence and is a cytoplasmic protein in e. coli and thus is unlikely to act as a fibronectin adhesin. glnq is  transcribed in an operon with a putative glutamine permease gene, glnp, which has a novel predicted structure containing three distinct domains linked in a single  gene. the first two domains are putative glutamine binding domains with homology  to the e. coli periplasmic glutamine binding gene glnh. the third is a putative permease domain with homology to the e. coli glutamine permease gene glnp. rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that glnp and glnq are contained within a single transcript. transcription of scpb, encoding the only known fibronectin-binding adhesin of gbs, is unaffected. we speculate that glnq may regulate expression of  fibronectin adhesins by affecting cytoplasmic glutamine levels and that regulation may be posttranscriptional.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == [neonatal bacterial infection by maternal-fetal contamination: for a change in approach? 2. uncertainties and proposals].
AB  == based on a critical analysis of the literature, it is clear that even though mortality has decreased to 10-15%, the prevalence of neonatal bacterial infections remains dramatically stable. precise risk factors can be identified in most cases of neonatal infection, but remain uncertain in many others: streptococcus agalactiae is found in only 40% of the cases of sepsis; escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and group a streptococcus strains should also be considered for a real prophylactic strategy; context (prematurity), lack of a consensual attitude for intrapartum strategies; management schemes for asymptomatic neonates. based on these observations, we make proposals for a realistic attitude for everyday practice based on risk factors, maternal and neonatal bacterial sampling procedures, and modalities for  neonatal antibiotic therapy.

TI  == definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == objective: to define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. design: observational study. setting: university hospital gasthuisberg, leuven, belgium. sample: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. methods: samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). results: genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. conclusion: aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group b streptococci and e. coli. its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. the most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. in theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel beta1,3-galactosyltransferase for capsular  polysaccharide synthesis by streptococcus agalactiae type ib.
AB  == a group b streptococcus, streptococcus agalactiae type ib, produces a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide consisting of the following pentasaccharide  repeating unit: -->4)-[alpha-d-neupnac-(2-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)]-beta-d -galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcp-(1-->. the type-specific capsular polysaccharide (cp) synthesis (cps) genes of this strain were cloned and analyzed. a cloned 10-kb dna fragment contained cpsibe to l and neu (neuraminic acid synthesis gene) b. comparison of the gene products with those of s. agalactiae type ia, which has a  similar but distinct cp, showed that the translation products of cpsia and cpsib  genes exhibited very high homology except for those of cpsj and k. in the type ia strain, cpsiaj encodes beta1,4-galactosyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of galactose as the fourth monosaccharide of the sugar repeating unit. in the type ib cp, this galactose forms a beta1,3-linkage to glcnac. the low homology between the type ia and ib cpsjs seems to reflect this difference. by enzymatic activity measurement, the cpsibj product was found to display beta1,3-galactosyltransferase activity. furthermore, hydrophobic cluster analysis clarified the similarities and differences of the structures in n-terminal regions, including the dxd motif, between the galactosyltransferases.

AB  == objective: we studied the production of cytokines in purified cultures of human term trophoblasts in the presence of pathogenic strains of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae, which have been identified in intrauterine infections.  methods: human villous trophoblasts were isolated from term placentas after cesarean section and purified by several steps. after 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation with the different heat-inactivated bacteria, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6 (il-6), interleukin-8 (il-8), and interleukin-10 (il-10) as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) were measured from supernatants by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. expression of cytokine mrnas was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). results: in nonstimulated cultures, low (il-1beta and tnf-alpha) and high (il-6, il-8, and il-10) basal secretion of cytokines was detectable. the pathogenic microorganisms induced a dose- and time-dependent release of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and il-10, whereas tnf-alpha secretion was not elevated. e coli was the most potent inducer followed by b fragilis, s agalactiae, s aureus, and m hominis. transcripts encoding il-1beta, il-6, il-8, or il-10 were elevated in the rt-pcr reactions, suggesting  that transcriptional mechanisms contribute to elevated cytokine expression. conclusion: pathogenic microorganisms stimulated mrna expression and polypeptide  release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from placental trophoblasts. induction of both inflammation-promoting and inflammation-inhibiting cytokines by bacterial products could play a role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with chorioamnionitis.

AB  == background: the aim of this study was to characterize perinatal escherichia coli  disease, and to analyze its possible correlation with the employment of prophylaxis for group b streptococcal (gbs)disease. patients and method: between  1994 and 2000, 24 neonates born in our hospital were diagnosed of early-onset e.  coli disease: 12 born to mothers who received prenatal care in our center and 12  born to mothers who were referred from other hospitals shortly before labor. three further neonates born in other centers were also referred with the same diagnosis. results: the annual rate did not change significantly (rr:1.065; confidence interval [ci] 95% -0.873-1.301; p = 0.533):from 0.6 per 1,000 live births in 1994 to 1.7 per 1,000 in 1997 and 0.5 in 2000. among mothers, 92% presented obstetric risk factors including 68% with prematurity (mean 32.9 gestation weeks, median 32), 64% with prolonged rupture of membranes (mean 184 hours,median 44), and 56% with intrapartum fever. twelve percent of mothers received intrapartum ampicillin as prophylaxis against gbs and 80% received antibiotics: prophylaxis for rupture of membranes in 6 cases, treatment of urinary tract infection in 6 cases and treatment of probable chorioamnionitis in  8 cases. ampicillin-resistant e. coli was isolated in 81% of neonates. no significant correlation was found between ampicillin resistance and prematurity(p = 0.57), rupture of membranes (p = 0.63), intrapartum fever(p = 0.24) or death (p = 0.53). conclusions: our results suggest that perinatal e. coli disease is not related with the employment of prophylaxis against gbs disease. instead, it seems to be related with prematurity, prolonged gestation in premature rupture of membranes and exposure to antibiotics.

AB  == objective: to determine whether intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for neonatal group b streptococcal (gbs) disease has resulted in an increased rate of non-gbs  or antibiotic-resistant early-onset invasive neonatal disease. methods: maternal  and infant chart review of all infants with bacteria other than gbs isolated from blood or spinal fluid in 1996 through 1999 in 19 hospitals (representing 81% of in-state births to state residents) throughout connecticut. suspected cases were  identified through clinical microbiology laboratory records or through international classification of diseases, ninth revision codes when microbiology  records were incomplete. results: ninety-four cases of non-gbs early-onset sepsis or meningitis were detected between 1996 and 1999. the rate of gbs-related early-onset infection (days 0-6 of life) dropped from 0.61/1000 to 0.23/1000 births, but the annual rate of non-gbs sepsis remained steady, ranging from 0.65  to 0.68/1000 during the surveillance period. there was an increase in the proportion of escherichia coli infections that were ampicillin resistant between  1996 and 1998, but the proportion decreased. in 1999 conclusion: there was no increase in the incidence of non-gbs early-onset neonatal infections between 1996 and 1999. fluctuations in the annual incidence of e coli infections, including ampicillin-resistant infections, suggest the need for continuation of surveillance in connecticut and expansion to monitor larger populations.

TI  == group b streptococcal disease: from trials and tribulations to triumph and trepidation.
AB  == group b streptococci garnered attention during the 1970s when they surpassed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus to become the principal causes of sepsis in early infancy. during the 1980s, several clinical trials demonstrated that administration of antimicrobial agents during labor could interrupt vertical transmission and prevent invasive disease in the first week of life (i.e., early-onset disease). however, prophylaxis was not widely used during the next 10 years. on the basis of efforts by clinician-researchers, professional organizations, community-based parent advocacy groups, and the public health community, consensus recommendations for group b streptococcal prophylaxis were finally issued in 1996. by the end of 1999, the incidence of early-onset disease  in selected counties within the united states had decreased by 70%, and the gap between black and white persons with disease narrowed by 75%. this recent triumph leaves the professional community treading lightly, alert to the need to monitor  for unintended consequences that may threaten recent progress.

AB  == the mrea gene from streptococcus agalactiae coh31 gamma/delta, resistant to macrolides and clindamycin by active efflux, has recently been cloned in escherichia coli, where it was reported to confer macrolide resistance (j. clancy, f. dib-hajj, j. w. petitpas, and w. yuan, antimicrob. agents chemother. 41:2719--2723, 1997). cumulative data suggested that the mrea gene was located on the chromosome of s. agalactiae coh31 gamma/delta. analysis of the deduced amino  acid sequence of mrea revealed significant homology with several bifunctional flavokinases/(flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) synthetases, which convert riboflavin to flavin mononucleotide (fmn) and fmn to fad, respectively. high-performance liquid chromatography experiments showed that the mrea gene product had a monofunctional flavokinase activity, similar to that of ribr from bacillus subtilis. sequences identical to those of the mrea gene and of a 121-bp  upstream region containing a putative promoter were detected in strains of s. agalactiae ucn4, ucn5, and ucn6 susceptible to macrolides. mrea and its allele from s. agalactiae ucn4 were cloned on the shuttle vector pat28. both constructs  were introduced into e. coli, where they conferred a similar two- to fourfold increase in the mics of erythromycin, spiramycin, and clindamycin. the mics of a  variety of other molecules, including crystal violet, acriflavin, sodium dodecyl  sulfate, and antibiotics, such as certain cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and rifampin, were also increased. in contrast, resistance to these compounds was not detected when the constructs were introduced into e. faecalis jh2-2. in conclusion, the mrea gene was probably resident in s. agalactiae and may encode a metabolic function. we could not provide any evidence that it was responsible for macrolide resistance in s. agalactiae coh31 gamma/delta; broad-spectrum resistance conferred by the gene in  e. coli could involve multidrug efflux pumps by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == development of a rapid and sensitive test for identification of major pathogens in bovine mastitis by pcr.
AB  == bovine mastitis is the most important source of loss for the dairy industry. a rapid and specific test for the detection of the main pathogens of bovine mastitis is not actually available. molecular probes reacting in pcr with bacterial dna from bovine milk, providing direct and rapid detection of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus  dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, and streptococcus uberis, have been developed. two sets of specific primers were designed for each of these microorganisms and appeared to discriminate close phylogenic bacterial species (e.g., s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae). in addition, two sets of universal primers were designed to react as positive controls with all major pathogens of bovine mastitis. the sensitivities of the test using s. aureus dna extracted from milk with and without a pre-pcr enzymatic lysis step of bacterial cells were compared. the detection limit of the assay was 3.125 x 10(2) cfu/ml of milk when  s. aureus dna was extracted with the pre-pcr enzymatic step compared to 5 x 10(3) cfu/ml of milk in the absence of the pre-pcr enzymatic step. this latter threshold of sensitivity is still compatible with its use as an efficient tool of diagnosis in bovine mastitis, allowing the elimination of expensive reagents. the two pcr tests avoid cumbersome and lengthy cultivation steps, can be performed within hours, and are sensitive, specific, and reliable for the direct detection  in milk of the six most prevalent bacteria causing bovine mastitis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pmv158 family.
AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to isolate fungi from the quarter milk of cow udders in 9 dairy farms. the samples were collected between may 1996 and april 2000 in the lublin region. six hundred and four milk samples collected from the quarters of 172 cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis were examined. milk samples were plated as soon as possible on blood agar (ba), mac conkey agar, aesculin-tallium acetate-crystal violet blood agar, and sabouraud agar with chloramphenicol and gentamicin. fifty eight (9.6%) of the samples were positive for fungi. all of the fungal isolates were yeasts of the genera candida, rhodotorula and trichosporon. we also isolated streptococcus agalactiae (4.9%), str. spp.(6.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci-cns (36.6%), escherichia coli (3.5%), other microorganisms (2.6%) and no growth (25.8%).

TI  == the major bovine mastitis pathogens have different cell tropisms in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells.
AB  == we previously showed that staphylococcus aureus cells adhered mainly to an elongated cell type, present in cultures of bovine mammary gland cells. moreover, we showed that this adhesion was mediated by binding to fibronectin. the same in  vitro model was used here, to study adhesion of other important mastitis pathogens. like the s. aureus strains, the streptococcus dysgalactiae strains adhered mainly to elongated cells, which seemed to be mediated by fibronectin binding. in contrast, streptococcus uberis strains adhered mainly to cubic cells. since the cubic cells did not express fibronectin and s. uberis cells bound fibronectin less efficiently, the adhesion of s. uberis cells was independent of  fibronectin binding. streptococcus agalactiae strains adhered poorly to both cell types. the specificity and efficiency of adhesion of escherichia coli strains was strongly strain dependent. none of the s. agalactiae and e. coli strains tested was able to bind fibronectin efficiently. the results suggest that the different  mastitis pathogens have different target cell specificities and use different mechanisms to adhere to cells of the bovine mammary gland.

TI  == intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  == objective: to determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. methods: a 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for  which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. one hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. results: microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. these differed significantly from  culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). group b streptococcus (gbs) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13  as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. gbs,  mu urealyticum, and streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, bacteroides/prevotella and s. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. the spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor  at later gestations; however, gbs appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. conclusions: unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. gbs is a key pathogen in this setting.

TI  == prevention of group b streptococcus early-onset neonatal sepsis: comparison of the center for disease control and prevention screening-based protocol to a risk-based protocol in infants at greater than 37 weeks' gestation.
AB  == objective: to compare the center for disease control consensus guidelines' screening-based strategy to a risk-based strategy as regards the incidence of early-onset group b streptococcus (gbs) infection among term infants. study design: a cohort of university hospital prenatal clinic mother-infant pairs who were screened for gbs at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation were compared to a matched control group of unscreened mother-infant pairs from the outreach satellite prenatal clinics who delivered at the same institution during the same time period. gbs screening was carried out with rectovaginal cultures plated on selective media. gbs-positive women received antimicrobial prophylaxis in labor whereas women of unknown gbs status were only treated intrapartum if they had a risk factor for gbs infection. principal outcome variables included incidence of  cases of neonatal early-onset gbs sepsis (blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid positive for gbs), incidence of cases of strongly suspected gbs sepsis (culture negative), and incidence of neonatal sepsis with non-gbs organisms. results: there were 3164 screened mother-infant pairs who were compared to 2684 unscreened pairs. the incidence of gbs carriage was 13.3%. a random sample of 420 screened women were compared to a matched sample of 407 women of unknown gbs carrier status for characterization of demographics and risk factors. no cases of documented gbs sepsis occurred in the infants of the screened women, but four cases occurred among the infants of the women who did not undergo screening (incidence 1.5/1000) (p = 0.04), only one of whom had a risk factor for gbs infection. cases of suspected but culture negative sepsis were not more common in the screened population when compared to the unscreened. there was one case of escherichia coli sepsis in an infant of a mother in the unscreened group. conclusions: gbs screening at 35 to 37 weeks, with intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis of carriers, decreased the incidence of neonatal early-onset gbs sepsis and appears to have advantages over treatment based on risk factors alone  in term infants.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == genetic basis for the beta-haemolytic/cytolytic activity of group b streptococcus.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) express a beta-haemolysin/cytolysin that contributes to disease pathogenesis. we report an independent discovery and extension of a genetic locus encoding the gbs beta-haemolysin/cytolysin activity. a plasmid library of gbs chromosomal dna was cloned into escherichia coli, and a transformant was identified as beta-haemolytic on blood agar. the purified plasmid contained a 4046 bp insert of gbs dna encoding two complete open reading  frames (orfs). a partial upstream orf (cylb) and the first complete orf (cyle) represent the 3' end of a newly reported genetic locus (cyl) required for gbs haemolysin/cytolysin activity. orf cyle is predicted to encode a 78.3 kda protein without genbank homologies. the gbs dna fragment also includes a previously unreported orf, cylf, with homology to bacterial aminomethyltransferases, and the 5' end of cylh, with homology to 3-ketoacyl-acp synthases. southern analysis demonstrated that the cyl locus was conserved among gbs of all common serotypes.  targeted plasmid integrational mutagenesis was used to disrupt cylb, cyle, cylf and cylh in three wild-type gbs strains representing serotypes ia, iii and v. targeted integrations in cylb, cylf and cylh retaining wild-type haemolytic activity were identified in all strains. in contrast, targeted integrations in cyle were invariably non-haemolytic and non-cytolytic, a finding confirmed by in  frame allelic exchange of the cyle gene. the haemolytic/cytolytic activity of the cyle allelic exchange mutants could be restored by reintroduction of cyle on a plasmid vector. inducible expression of cyle, cylf and cylef demonstrated that it is cyle that confers haemolytic activity in e. coli. we conclude that cyle probably represents the structural gene for the gbs haemolysin/cytolysin, a novel bacterial toxin.

TI  == neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission: an epidemiological study from the "grupo de hospitales castrillo".
AB  == a prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in spain. the study was carried out by the "grupo de hospitales castrillo" that included the neonatal services of 19 tertiary care (reference) hospitals and 9 secondary care hospitals. prospective data from infants with culture-proved neonatal sepsis, clinical sepsis and bacteremia were recorded for 1995 to 1997. in a total of 203,288 neonates, proven sepsis was diagnosed in 515 (rate of 2.5 per 1000 live births), clinical sepsis in 724 (rate of 3.6 per 1000 live births), and bacteremia of vertical transmission in 155 (rate of 0.76 per 1000 live births). very low birth weight (vlbw) infants (< or = 1500 g) showed a significantly higher incidence of confirmed sepsis (26.5 per 1000 live births) and clinical sepsis (32.4 per 1000 live births) than infants weighing > 1500 g. streptococcus agalactiae was the most frequent causative pathogen in cases of proven sepsis (51%) and bacteremia (33%), but escherichia coli was the most frequently recovered organism in the vlbw group. the mortality rate of proven sepsis was significantly higher than that of clinical sepsis (8.7% versus 4.3%) (p < 0.01). in the vlbw cohort, there  were no significant differences in the mortality rate between proven sepsis and clinical sepsis. in conclusion, clinical sepsis was the most frequent diagnosis,  probably related to intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. streptococcus agalactiae was the most frequent causative pathogen of culture-positive sepsis and bacteremia, whereas e. coli was the most significant in vlbw infants.

TI  == influence of modified natural or synthetic surfactant preparations on growth of bacteria causing infections in the neonatal period.
AB  == connatal bacterial pneumonia is common in neonates. animal studies and initial clinical reports indicate that surfactant dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of severe neonatal pneumonia. since respiratory distress syndrome and connatal pneumonia may be difficult to differentiate in the first hours of life, neonates with respiratory failure due to bacterial infections might receive surfactant. under such conditions surfactant components might be catabolized by bacteria and promote bacterial growth. we therefore investigated the influence of three modified natural (curosurf, alveofact, and survanta) and two synthetic (exosurf and pumactant) surfactant preparations on the growth of bacteria frequently cultured from blood or tracheal aspirate fluid in the first days of life. group b streptococci (gbs), staphyloccocus aureus, and escherichia coli were incubated in a nutrient-free medium (normal saline) for 5 h at 37 degrees c, together with different surfactants at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 20 mg/ml.  with the exception of e. coli, incubation in saline alone led to a variable decrease in cfu. in the presence of alveofact, exosurf, and pumactant the decline in bacterial numbers was less marked than in saline alone. curosurf was bactericidal in a dose-dependent fashion for gbs and had a strong negative impact on the growth of a gbs subtype that lacked the polysaccharide capsule. in contrast, survanta (10 and 20 mg/ml) significantly promoted the growth of e. coli, indicating that surfactant components may actually serve as nutrients. we conclude that bacterial growth in different surfactant preparations is influenced by microbial species and the composition and dose of the surfactant. further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind our findings and to evaluate the effects of surfactant on bacterial growth in vivo.

TI  == the serotype of type ia and iii group b streptococci is determined by the polymerase gene within the polycistronic capsule operon.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is a primary cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.  essential to the virulence of this pathogen is the production of a type-specific  capsular polysaccharide (cps) that enables the bacteria to evade host immune defenses. the identification, cloning, sequencing, and functional characterization of seven genes involved in type iii capsule production have been previously reported. here, we describe the cloning and sequencing of nine additional adjacent genes, cps(iii)fghijkl, neu(iii)b, and neu(iii)c. sequence comparisons suggested that these genes are involved in sialic acid synthesis, pentasaccharide repeating unit formation, and oligosaccharide transport and polymerization. the type iii cps (cpsiii) locus was comprised of 16 genes within  15.5 kb of contiguous chromosomal dna. primer extension analysis and investigation of mrna from mutants with polar insertions in their cpsiii loci supported the hypothesis that the operon is transcribed as a single polycistronic message. the translated cpsiii sequences were compared to those of the s. agalactiae cpsia locus, and the primary difference between the operons was found  to reside in cps(iii)h, the putative cps polymerase gene. expression of cps(iii)h in a type ia strain resulted in suppression of cps ia synthesis and in production of a cps which reacted with type iii-specific polyclonal antibody. likewise, expression of the putative type ia polymerase gene in a type iii strain reduced synthesis of type iii cps with production of a type ia immunoreactive capsule. based on the similar structures of the oligosaccharide repeating units of the type ia and iii capsules, our observations demonstrated that cps(ia)h and cps(iii)h encoded the type ia and iii cps polymerases, respectively. additionally, these findings suggested that a single gene can confer serotype specificity in organisms that produce complex polysaccharides.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. cd14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including lps. however, little is known of monocyte receptors involved  in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. to identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mabs and tnf-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. human serum and anti-cd14 abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, tnf-alpha responses to the gram-negative escherichia coli. however, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the gram-positive bacteria tested, including group a and b streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus  aureus. complement receptor type iii (cr3 or cd18/cd11b) abs prevented tnf-alpha  release induced by heat-killed group a or b streptococci. in contrast, the same abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus. using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of tnf-alpha  release was produced by abs to cd11c, one of the subunits of cr4. to confirm these blocking ab data, il-6 release was measured in cr3-, cr4-, or cd14-transfected chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate il-6 production (p < 0.05) in cr3 but not cd14 or cr4 transfectants. in contrast, l. monocytogenes and s. aureus induced il-6 release in cr4 but not cr3 or cd14 transfectants. collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as cr3 and cr4, may be involved in cytokine responses to gram-positive bacteria. moreover, cd14 may play a more important role in responses to whole gram-negative bacteria relative to gram-positive ones.

TI  == induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by human monocytes exposed to group b streptococci.
AB  == group b streptococcal (gbs) infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. the molecular pathways mediating the pathophysiological events in gbs  infection are not fully delineated. cyclooxygenases (cox) are the enzymes that convert arachidonate to active eicosanoids. to identify the effects of gbs on eicosanoid metabolism and regulatory mechanisms, we exposed human monocytes to gbs and found that they secreted prostaglandin e2, prostacyclin, and thromboxane  a2. exposure to gbs caused monocytes to express cox-2 mrna and protein in both a  time- and concentration-dependent manner that correlated with eicosanoid production. cox-1 protein was unchanged. addition of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-4 or il-10 markedly attenuated gbs-induced cox-2 protein accumulation after gbs exposure, as did inhibition of p38 mapk. our experiments are the first to show that exposure of monocytes to a gram-positive bacterium (gbs) results in induction of functional cox-2, suggesting that eicosanoids may play important roles in the pathogenesis of gbs infections.

TI  == frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats.
AB  == background: infectious complications in severe pancreatitis are the main factors  determining clinical course and outcome. the taurocholate model for acute necrotizing pancreatitis was evaluated for frequency and time course of pancreatic and extrapancreatic bacterial infection. methods: sixty-five male wistar rats were divided into 5 groups of 13 animals each. specimens for bacteriologic examination were taken, and pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of 3% taurocholate under sterile conditions. animals were killed 8, 16,  24, or 32 hours thereafter, and bacteriologic examination was performed. a control group of animals with intraductal infusion of 0.9% saline solution were killed after 32 hours. results: there was no significant pancreatic infection in  the control group and in the 8-hour group (1 of 13 rats). sixteen and 24 hours after induction of pancreatitis, infection and inflammation of the pancreas were  found in 77% (10 of 13 rats), and after 32 hours pancreatic infection occurred in 69% (9 of 13 rats). extrapancreatic bacterial infection after 16 hours occurred in the liver (62%), spleen (62%), and mesenteric lymph nodes (46%). bacteria infecting the pancreas reflected the bacterial spectrum of the large bowel and terminal ileum before induction of pancreatitis (escherichia coli [77%], proteus  [43%], enterococcus [37%], and staphylococcus [23%]). conclusions: pancreatic infection is an early and frequent finding in the taurocholate model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. infection occurs between 8 and 16 hours after induction of pancreatitis. the source of infecting bacteria seems to be the large bowel or  the terminal ileum. we present a useful model of severe pancreatitis in which to  study bacterial translocation, the further route of spread, and therapeutic approaches.

TI  == [acquired antibiotic resistance in madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in madagascar. testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the pasteur institute of madagascar in antananarivo between october 1997 and october 1998. antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. results were read according to the criteria of the antibiogram  committee of the french society of microbiology. preliminary findings documented  a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin g and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which  80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of shigella sp. respectively were resistant. second-line antibiotics including penicillin m, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an  effective alternative. newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. although not representative of madagascar as a whole, the  findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care  workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == readmission for group b streptococci or escherichia coli infection among full-term, singleton, vaginally delivered neonates after early discharge from florida hospitals for births from 1992 through 1994.
AB  == background: in florida during the period 1992 through 1994, there was a major drop in the length of stay for full-term, singleton, vaginally delivered newborn  babies in the hospital. a major concern on the part of clinicians has been the potential of an increased risk of sepsis (manifesting itself after discharge) associated with earlier newborn discharge from the hospital. we used the florida  hospital discharge dataset to study the frequency of readmission with sepsis after early newborn discharge to home. methods: using the florida agency for health-care administration acute care hospital discharge dataset, we used a multivariate, probabilistic matching algorithm to merge newborn discharge records for births from 1992 through 1994 with readmission discharge records (including hospital-to-hospital transfers and multiple readmissions) during the first 28 days of life. we used the resulting merged dataset to study bacterial infection diagnoses on newborn and readmission records and to examine relationships between readmission diagnoses and timing of newborn discharge among the 364,528 full-term, singleton, vaginally delivered babies (ftsvdbs) without congenital anomalies from 1992 through 1994 in florida acute-care hospitals. results: overall, 86.3% of all ftsvdbs born in florida acute-care hospitals were discharged between day of life (dol) 0 (born and discharged the same day) and dol 2 (discharged two calendar days after birth). the group b streptococci (gbs) infection code was found on the newborn discharge records of 9.2 per 10,000 ftsvdbs over the 3-year period, 5.9% of which involved hospital-to-hospital transfer of the baby. escherichia coli infection codes were found on the records  of 3.4 per 10,000 ftsvdbs over the 3-year period, 2.3% of which involved hospital-to-hospital transfer of the baby. of those ftsvdbs discharged to home without infection codes during dol 1 to 2, 0.8 per 10,000 were readmitted within  7 days (inclusive) with gbs infection, and 2.0 per 10,000 with e. coli infection. when the data for readmitted babies were pooled for 1992 through 1994, the odds ratio for probability of readmission comparing discharges on dol 1 to dol 2 for gbs was 2.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.83 to 2.70), and for e. coli 2.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.46 to 2.85). over this 3-year period, for babies discharged on dol 1, there was a 115% increase in the rate of readmission for gbs from 1992 through 1994 (p < 0.01) and a 36.5% increase in the rate of readmission for e. coli (p < 0.05). however, among ftsvdbs discharged on dol 2, the rate of readmission for both gbs and e. coli did not change during the period 1992 through 1994. there were no deaths among ftsvdbs as either newborns, transfers, or readmissions within 7 days of discharge, with either gbs or e. coli infection  codes on their discharge record. conclusion: from 1992 through 1994, the increased number of babies discharged early in florida was temporally associated  with an increased rate of readmission during the week after discharge for both gbs and e. coli infection among babies discharged on the calendar day after birth. with an increase in both the number of babies exposed to the risks of early discharge, and an increased rate of these serious infections during the week after discharge from the hospital, the number of these babies grew to exceed, by several fold, the number of babies with inborn errors of metabolism picked up by state screening programs.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

TI  == risk factors and opportunities for prevention of early-onset neonatal sepsis: a multicenter case-control study.
AB  == background: early-onset group b streptococcal (gbs) prevention efforts are based  on targeted use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap); applicability of these prevention efforts to infections caused by other organisms is not clear. methods: multicenter surveillance during 1995 to 1996 for culture-confirmed, early-onset sepsis in an aggregate of 52 406 births; matched case-control study of risk factors for gbs and other sepsis. results: early-onset disease occurred in 188 infants (3.5 cases per 1000 live births). gbs (1.4 cases per 1000 births)  and escherichia coli (0.6 cases per 1000 births) caused most infections. gbs sepsis less often occurred in preterm deliveries compared with other sepsis. compared with gestation-matched controls without documented sepsis, gbs disease was associated with intrapartum fever (matched or, 4.1; ci, 1.2-13.4) and frequent vaginal exams (matched or, 2.9; ci, 1.1-8. 0). an obstetric risk factor-preterm delivery, intrapartum fever, or membrane rupture >/=18 hours-was found in 49% of gbs cases and 79% of other sepsis. iap had an adjusted efficacy of 68.2% against any early-onset sepsis. ampicillin resistance was evident in 69% of e coli infections. no deaths occurred among susceptible e coli infections, whereas 41% of ampicillin-resistant e coli infections were fatal. ninety-one percent of infants who developed ampicillin-resistant e coli infections were preterm, and 59% of these infants were born to mothers who had received iap. conclusions: either prenatal gbs screening or a risk-based strategy could potentially prevent a substantial portion of gbs cases. sepsis caused by other organisms is more often a disease of prematurity. iap seemed efficacious against  early-onset sepsis. however, the severity of ampicillin-resistant e coli sepsis and its occurrence after maternal antibiotics suggest caution regarding use of ampicillin instead of penicillin for gbs prophylaxis.

TI  == intracellular and extracellular cytokine production by human mixed mononuclear cells in response to group b streptococci.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are a major cause of severe infection in newborns, pregnant females, and other immunocompromised hosts. infection often includes septicemia, shock, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. in previous studies, we have reported that gbs induce marked production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) by human mononuclear cells. the present study was designed to measure the production of tnf-alpha as well as additional cytokines, including interleukin 1beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, il-12, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) but also to determine from what cells and at what time point during incubation with gbs that these cytokines are produced. mixed mononuclear cells were incubated with heat-killed gbs, media alone, or 1 microg of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps). brefeldin a was added to each sample prior to staining, which prevented the export of cytokines by the golgi apparatus. the cells were then stained with the appropriate conjugated antibodies and analyzed by using a flow cytometer. results indicate that intracellular cytokines appear, in almost all cases, simultaneous to or before secreted proteins are detected. in contrast  to the response to lps, where tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-6, and il-8 appear almost simultaneously, the human monocyte response to gbs results in the production of tnf-alpha but delayed appearance of il-1beta, il-6, and il-8. the lymphocyte response to gbs was also strikingly different from that to lps in that both secreted ifn-gamma and il-12 was detected, while lps failed to induce production  of these critical cytokines. this suggests an important role for tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, and il-12 in gbs pathogenesis and/or immunity.

AB  == objective: to define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. study design: maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. results: logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% ci 1.004-8.56), apgar score after 1 min (odds  ratio 0.7, 95% ci 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis  (odds ratio 4.1, 95% ci 1.36-12.12). there was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% ci 1.07-17.40). funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. conclusions: independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. the histological examination of the umbilical cord can  be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.

TI  == an escherichia coli-enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector as a tool for the construction of a group b streptococcus heterologous mutant expressing the beta antigen (bac) of the c protein complex.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) represent a very important group of human pathogens. so far little is known about the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause disease and the bacterial factors involved. one putative virulence factor is the  beta antigen of the c protein complex (bac), which can bind to the fc region of human iga. its binding function might represent an important virulence mechanism. however, the genetic manipulation of this group of bacteria, necessary to prove involvement of bacterial factors in pathogenesis, is still in its infancy. we therefore tested the pam401 vector system for its suitability in the construction of a heterologous expression mutant using the bac protein as a model antigen. the bac gene, including its own promoter, was cloned into the escherichia coli-enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pam401 and was stably maintained extrachromosomally in the bac-deficient gbs strain 335. expression of bac was assessed by extracting the protein from transformed 335(ppjtu1) cells, negative controls (335 wild-type, 335(pam401)) and other bac-expressing gbs strains (a909, la239). blots of the extracted proteins probed with iga, polyclonal sera and a monoclonal antibody raised against bac clearly revealed expression of the 130-kda protein in the transformed gbs 335(ppjtu1) cells. the correct processing and surface anchoring of the expressed bac was demonstrated by binding of (125)i-labelled iga to whole cells. strain 335(ppjtu1) bound 12 times as much iga compared to the parental strain la239 and the gbs 335 negative controls, and a total of 25% compared to the high-level-expressing strain a909. our studies show  that the pam401 shuttle vector can be used for stable heterologous expression of  surface proteins in gbs. our strategy is also of major importance for the complementation of deletion mutants in gbs and other gram-positive human pathogens to fulfill koch's postulates. the bac mutant constructed in this study, 335(ppjtu1), can be used in animal models to assess the importance of bac in gbs  pathogenesis.

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == characterization of enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  == we have identified and characterized an enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (ap, encoded by phoz). the predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from bacillus subtilis. expression of phoz in escherichia coli, e. faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), or streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (xp or bcip). two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. first, elimination of the signal sequence reduced ap activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. restoration of export, using the signal sequence from c5a peptidase, restored ap activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which ap was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). in e. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher ap activity than the cytoplasmic  fusion. we concluded that ap activity is export dependent. the signal sequence deletion mutant, phozdeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from  gbs that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the rib protein (a cell  wall protein from gbs) or with dppb (an integral membrane protein from gas). ap acts as a reporter enzyme in gbs, gas, and e. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == the type-specific capsular polysaccharide (cp) of a group b streptococcus, streptococcus agalactiae type ia, is a high-molecular-weight polymer consisting of the pentasaccharide repeating unit 4)-[alpha-d-neupnac-(2-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1- ->3 )]-beta-d-galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcp-(1. here, cloning, sequencing, and transcription of the type ia-specific capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) genes and functional analysis of these gene products are described. a 26-kb dna fragment containing 18 complete open reading frames (orfs) was cloned. these orfs were designated cpsiaa to cpsial, neu (neuraminic acid synthesis gene) a to d, orf1 and ung (uracil dna glycosylase). the cps gene products of s. agalactiae type ia were homologous to proteins involved in cp synthesis of s. agalactiae type iii and s. pneumoniae serotype 14. unlike the cps gene cluster of s. pneumoniae serotype 14, transcription of this operon may start from cpsiaa, cpsiae, and orf1 because putative promoter sequences were found in front of these genes. northern hybridization, reverse transcription-pcr, and primer extension analyses supported this hypothesis. dna sequence analysis showed that there were  two transcriptional terminators in the 3' end of this operon (downstream of orf1  and ung). the functions of cpsiae, cpsiag, cpsiai, and cpsiaj were examined by glycosyltransferase assay by using the gene products expressed in escherichia coli jm109 harboring plasmids containing various s. agalactiae type ia cps gene fragments. enzyme assays suggested that the gene products of cpsiae, cpsiag, cpsiai, and cpsiaj are putative glucosyltransferase, beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase, beta-1,3-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, respectively.

TI  == identification, cloning, and expression of the camp factor gene (cfa) of group a  streptococci.
AB  == the camp reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (camp factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c (beta-toxin). group a streptococci (gas [streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered camp negative, and this  reaction commonly has been used to distinguish gas from streptococcus agalactiae. we here provide evidence that gas possess this gene and produce an extracellular  camp factor capable of participating in a positive camp reaction. the s. pyogenes camp factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the camp factor genes from s. agalactiae and streptococcus uberis. this gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in escherichia coli. recombinant clones of e. coli expressing cfa secreted an active camp factor. the  deduced 28.5-kda protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. the cfa gene is widely spread among gas:  82 of 100 clinical gas isolates produced a positive camp reaction. of the camp-negative strains, 17 of the 18 gas strains contained the cfa gene. additionally, camp activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups c, m, p, r, and u. the cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in escherichia coli and  gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) under control  of the cfa promoter. these cfa promoter-lacz fusions were introduced into s. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they  showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. the results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the camp factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups a, b, c, g, m, p, r, and u.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in the newborn: a prospective study of mortality and morbidity.
AB  == neonatal bacterial meningitis is a serious disease around the world, with the incidence changing little in the past 30 years. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae are common causative organisms and lumbar puncture remains the definitive method of diagnosis. the mortality rate has declined in industrialized countries over the years, from almost 50% in the 1970s to less than 10% in 1997. however, neurological sequelae are still frequently observed despite major changes in treatment. preliminary analysis of our own data from a prospective study of cases in the united kingdom suggests that treatment with third generation cephalosporins is related to a decrease in mortality but not morbidity.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == [udder health on dairy farms. 1. results of a longitudinal study on 300 dutch farms].
AB  == udder health was studied in 300 dairy herds grouped in three categories according to the bulk milk somatic cell count. in all herds, lactating cows were housed in  a free-stall barn during the winter. all herds participated in a three or four-weekly milk recording system, had annual production quota between 300,000 and 900,000 kg, and were stocked with cows of the holstein-friesian or dutch friesian breeds. the incidence of clinical mastitis was not different among herds with a low (< or = 150,000), middle (151,000 to 250,000), or high (251,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk somatic cell count. clinical mastitis caused by gram-negative pathogens occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count. clinical mastitis caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, or streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count; however, the incidence of clinical streptococcus uberis mastitis was not different among the three herd categories.  the differences in bulk milk somatic cell count between the categories could be explained by the management practices studied. the incidence of clinical e. coli  mastitis was mostly related to housing, hygiene, and milking machine. the incidence of clinical staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with factors  that were related to the bulk milk somatic cell count and to factors of which it  was not clear whether they were a cause or effect of the high incidence of staphylococcus aureus mastitis. the incidence of clinical streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis was related to nutrition, milking technique, and milking machine. the incidence of clinical streptococcus uberis mastitis was associated with housing, nutrition, and milking machine. two groups of farmers and herds could be differentiated. the first group was identified as 'clean and accurate',  and the second group as 'quick and dirty'. the relationship between these two groups and bulk milk somatic cell count category was high. however, the relationship between the two groups and the incidence of clinical mastitis was weak.

AB  == t-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. pazufloxacin (t-3761) is an active form of t-3762. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for prevotella bivia. the mics of t-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for s. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for g. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for e. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for p. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for b. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for p. bivia. the results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, t-3762, in combination with an agent  with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant by bacteria.
AB  == the epithelium of the lung is lined with extracellular pulmonary surfactant. this is the surface that invading bacteria first come into contact with when they enter the alveoli. as bacteria become established and interact with this layer, various characteristics of surfactant may become altered. we studied free radical production by three bacterial species, group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the effect of two concentrations of lung surfactant (curosurf at 0.04 and 0.4 mg/ml) on this production estimated by the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction test. we also measured the lipid peroxidation of surfactant at various incubation times (0-20 h), using a lpo-586 test kit. in addition, the effect of vitamin e as an antioxidant in a concentration of 0.5 microm was determined by the lipid peroxidation test. we found that the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction by the three bacterial species and lipid peroxidation  of lung surfactant increased with time. vitamin e reduced the lipid peroxidation  of this surfactant. by measuring bacterial growth at various incubation times we  showed that lung surfactant was bactericidal to group b streptococcal and e. coli strains and that p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to surfactant. we conclude  that bacteria, probably by their production of reactive oxygen species, cause lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  == in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of  urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking  the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples  were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard  bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to  co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics,  ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole,  which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes

TI  == lmb, a protein with similarities to the lrai adhesin family, mediates attachment  of streptococcus agalactiae to human laminin.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. adherence to extracellular matrix proteins is considered an important factor in the pathogenesis of infection, but the genetic determinants of this process remain largely unknown. we identified and sequenced a gene which codes for a putative lipoprotein that exhibits significant homology to the streptococcal lrai protein family. mutants of this locus were demonstrated to have substantially reduced adherence to immobilized human laminin. the nucleotide sequence of the gene was subsequently designated lmb (laminin binding) and shown to be present in all of the common serotypes of s. agalactiae. to determine the role of lmb in the adhesion of s. agalactiae wild-type strains to laminin, a recombinant lmb protein harboring six consecutive histidine residues at the c terminus was cloned, expressed, and purified from escherichia coli. preincubation of immobilized laminin with recombinant lmb significantly reduced adherence of the wild-type strain o90r to laminin. these results indicate that lmb mediates the attachment of s. agalactiae to human laminin, which may be essential for the bacterial colonization of damaged epithelium and translocation of bacteria into the bloodstream.

TI  == vaccines and diagnostic methods for bovine mastitis: fact and fiction.
AB  == a number of problems are uniquely associated with vaccination of dairy cows for mastitis. one of these is that the number of mastitis pathogens is numerous and heterogeneous. vaccine efforts have concentrated mainly on the major mastitis pathogens. while at least one s. aureus bacterin has been commercially available  for a number of years, no large-scale, independent field trials have been published in refereed journals which support the efficacy of this vaccine. experimental vaccines for s. aureus composed of pseudocapsule-enriched bacterins  supplemented with alpha- and/or beta-toxoids appear promising, but none of these  has been commercialized. with s. uberis, some protection against homologous strain challenges was reported recently with a live strain and a bacterin, but other data from the same laboratory showed this vaccine would not protect against heterologous challenge strains. at this time there is only one highly effective vaccine for mastitis, the core-antigen vaccine for coliform mastitis. all of the  commercially available vaccines for this indication are bacterins of rough mutants of e. coli strain j5 or salmonella spp. preliminary success with an experimental vaccine based on the plasminogen activator of s. uberis is a very different approach for a mastitis vaccine. little success has been reported with  vaccination against other mastitis pathogens. for diagnostic methods, the high somatic cell count, as measured by direct count or indirect assays, remains the cornerstone of mastitis diagnosis. however, for subclinical mastitis, bacterial cell culture is a reliable diagnostic method. pathogen identification may rely on older biochemical testing methods or newer commercial identification systems, depending on the laboratory budget. elisa assays also have been used to assess herd infection status. epidemiologic studies have used dna fingerprinting and ribotyping, but none of these methods has yet produced an easily utilized commercial format. within the next decade, additional efficacious vaccines for several of the most common agents for bovine mastitis are likely. a review written at that time then can be more fact than fiction.

AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

AB  == objectives: besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (no) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. we studied the antimicrobial properties of no in concentrations used with inhaled no therapy for the treatment of pulmonary  hypertension in neonates. design: in vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without no exposure. setting: level iv neonatal intensive care  unit at a university children's hospital. subjects: in vitro bacterial cultures.  interventions: we tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group b streptococcus [gbs/streptococcus agalactiae], escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of no (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains  incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. after incubation (with or without no), colony-forming units were counted. measurements and main results: bacterial growth of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa was not reduced with the no concentrations applied. the number of colony-forming units of s. aureus increased at 80 ppm of no. growth of s. epidermidis and gbs was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with  controls exposed to ambient air. conclusions: we conclude that no has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. this effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled no therapy. however, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled no in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of no is not to be expected.

TI  == potential consequences of widespread antepartal use of ampicillin.
AB  == objective: recommendations for the use of antenatal antibiotics in obstetrics have increased in the past few years, especially for prophylaxis against group b  streptococci, for prolongation of the latency time in patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes, and as an adjuvant treatment in preterm labor. our objective was to determine whether the use of antenatal ampicillin affects the incidence of and resistance of early-onset neonatal sepsis with organisms other than group b streptococci. study design: a prospective cohort study was performed between january 1, 1991, and december 31, 1996. every case of blood culture-proven neonatal sepsis was prospectively surveyed. the type of bacteria isolated, drug resistance, antenatal antibiotic use and treatment indication, gestational age at delivery, and other antenatal and outcome variables were gathered. early-onset neonatal sepsis was defined as disease onset within 7 days after birth. results: a total of 42 cases of early-onset neonatal sepsis among 29,897 neonates delivered were found during the 6-year period. of these, 15 cases were due to group b streptococci and 27 were the result of non-group b streptococcal organisms (21 gram-negative rods and 6 gram-positive cocci). among the 27 non-group b streptococcal cases, 15 mothers had received antenatal ampicillin and 13 of the 15 bacterial isolates from these neonates (87%) were resistant to ampicillin, versus only 2 ampicillin-resistant isolates (17%) among the 12 cases in which no antenatal antibiotics were administered (p = .0004). of the 15 mothers who were treated with ampicillin, 13 received more than 1 dose. in evaluating each year of the study, the overall administration of antibiotics to pregnant women in the antenatal period increased from <10% in 1991 to 16.9% in 1996. the incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis with group b streptococci decreased during this time, whereas the incidence of early-onset sepsis with non-group b streptococcal organisms, especially escherichia coli, increased. conclusions: the increased administration of antenatal ampicillin to pregnant women may be responsible for the increased incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis with non-group b streptococcal organisms that are resistant to ampicillin. at this time penicillin g, rather than ampicillin, is therefore recommended for prophylaxis against group b streptococci. in addition, future studies are needed to determine whether alternate approaches, such as immunotherapy or vaginal washing, could be of benefit.

AB  == the process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. in such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous dna. although the lacz  system has been used extensively for this purpose in e. coli, analogous systems for use in gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. we have developed a gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoz, to identify recombinant plasmids. to facilitate introduction of foreign dna, a multiple cloning site (mcs) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoz. alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoz gene (phozmcs) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. the phozmcs was transferred to pjs3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pdc123. in pdc123, phozmcs was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetm and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pjs3. s. agalactiae (group b  streptococci, gbs), e. faecalis, s. pyogenes, s. gordonii, and e. coli containing pdc123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (x-p), which was readily distinguished from  that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pjs3. introduction of foreign dna  into the mcs of phozmcs produced a white colonial phenotype in e. coli and gbs on agar containing x-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. we have used pdc123 to subclone the cpse gene from the plasmid pcer111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the gbs capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. the plasmid pdc123 containing cpse was isolated by direct electroporation into gbs strain a909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. this new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant dna experiments in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == partial budget of the discounted annual benefit of mastitis control strategies.
AB  == the objective of this study was to rank the benefits associated with various mastitis control strategies in simulated herds with intramammary infections caused by streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus spp. other than strep. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and escherichia coli. the control strategies tested were prevention, vaccination for  e. coli, lactation therapy, and dry cow antibiotic therapy. partial budgets were  based on changes caused by mastitis control strategies from the mean values for milk, fat, and protein yields of the control herd and the number of cows that were culled under a fixed mastitis culling criterion. each annual benefit (dollars per cow per year) of a mastitis control strategy was compared with the revenue for the control herd and was calculated under two different milk pricing  plans (3.5% milk fat and multiple-component pricing), three net replacement costs, and three prevalences of pathogen-specific intramammary infection. twenty  replicates of each control strategy were run with simmast (a dynamic discrete event stochastic simulation model) for 5 simulated yr. rankings of discounted annual benefits differed only slightly according to milk pricing plans within a pathogen group but differed among the pathogen groups. differences in net replacement costs for cows culled because of mastitis did not change the ranking  of control strategies within a pathogen group. both prevention and dry cow therapy were important mastitis control strategies. for herds primarily infected  with environmental pathogens, strategies that included vaccination for mastitis caused by e. coli dominated strategies that did not include vaccination against this microorganism.

TI  == in vitro activities of e1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  == e1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. e1101 was the most active agent against s. agalactiae and e. coli.  since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. the results of this study  suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, e1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == the streptococcus agalactiae hylb gene encoding hyaluronate lyase: completion of  the sequence and expression analysis.
AB  == we report the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hylb4755 allele, the first chromosomally-encoded streptococcal hyaluronate lyase gene to be cloned and sequenced completely. this  gene lies in a region homologous to that found in s. mutans, between the mutx and rmlb genes, a region involved in the synthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of this organism. sequencing of hylb4755 revealed a 3216-bp open reading frame that encodes a 121.2-kda polypeptide possessing a 30-amino acid signal sequence which was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. a recombinant plasmid, phyb100, containing hylb4755 together with its promoter and terminator was constructed and used to analyze the expression of the gene in escherichia coli. in northern hybridization experiments, hylb4755 was found to be transcribed as 3.3-kb monocistronic mrna from its own promoter which exhibits an extended, sigma70-like 10 consensus sequence. transcript mapping by primer extension analysis placed the major transcription initiation site leading to the longest transcript 38 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon, atg. e. coli tg1(phyb100) efficiently synthesized hyaluronan-cleaving enzyme activity at approximately 7000 working units/109 cells, with lyase activity detectable in all principle cellular locations. zymography and western analysis identified functional activity in tg1(phyb100) to be associated with approximately 118, 110 and 94-kda polypeptides, with the two low molecular weight species constituting the major components of the enzyme purified from the culture supernatant fluid of s. agalactiae 4755. the 118-kda form was shown to represent the undegraded mature enzyme, whereas the smaller species are likely to arise from proteolytic cleavage in the n-terminal part of the mature protein. the hylb4755 protein showed extensive sequence identity to the homologous enzymes from s. agalactiae 3502 and s. pneumoniae characterized by others but sequence comparisons clearly show that  incomplete genes truncated at their 5' ends had been isolated from these two organisms.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1996 to may 1997. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) were also active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa arbekacin (abk) and vcm showed the highest activities against both s. aureus and mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the  mic90s of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. the others except minocycline (mino) had low activities with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and vcm showed the strongest activities against s. epidermis isolated from patients with utis. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm) and cefozopran  (czop) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the mic90s of them had changed into  a better state. they ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except mino were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, czop, ipm, and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. tosufloxacin (tflx) and vcm were also active with the mic90s of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. citrobacter freundii gentamicin (gm) showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. ipm and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. cefpirome (cpr) and czop were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. the mic90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. the mic90s of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tflx were 1 microgram/ml, the mic90 of amk was 2 micrograms/ml, the mic90s of czop, gm and ofloxacin (oflx) were 4 micrograms/ml. the mic50s of cephems except cez, cefmetazole (cmz) and cefaclor (ccl) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. escherichia coli all drugs except penicillins and mino were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. among e. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except cez, cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox) and ccl have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8.  klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. cpr had the strongest activity, the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. flomoxef (fmox), cefixime (cfix), czop and carumonam (crmn) were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. pseudomonas aeruginosa all drugs except quinolones were not so active against p. aeruginosa with the mic90s were 32 micrograms/ml or above. quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. the mic90s of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the mic50s of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. serratia marcescens  gm showed the highest activity against s. marcescens. its mic90 was 1 micro

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

TI  == group b streptococci persist inside macrophages.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are an important cause of neonatal sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis. in the early phase of infection, macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells (pmn) are the first immune cells that interact with gbs.  in this in vitro study, to gain insight into gbs-macrophage interaction in the absence of type-specific antibodies, we examined the features of gbs survival in  thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages and the effect of gbs on the protein kinase c (pkc)-dependent transduction pathway. our results demonstrate that type ia gbs, strain 090 (gbs-ia) and type iii gbs strain coh 31r/s (gbs-iii), after in vitro phagocytosis survive and persist intracellularly  in macrophages for up to 24 and 48 hr, respectively. however, macrophage activation by interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide from escherichia coli (lps) caused a significant reduction in the time of intracellular persistence. macrophage activation by ifn-gamma and lps seems to be a multifactorial event involving multiple intracellular signal pathways also including pkc. since pkc is one of the components in the signal network leading to macrophage activation and an important target for several intracellular micro-organisms, we wondered whether pkc could have a role in intracellular gbs survival. both pkc depletion by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) for 18 hr and pkc inhibition by calphostin c rendered macrophages more permissive for the intracellular gbs survival. furthermore, gbs-infected macrophages were unable to respond to pma and lps, activators of pkc, by inducing antimicrobial activity. the ability of gbs to impair pkc-dependent cell signalling was also demonstrated by the reduced c-fos gene expression in gbs-infected macrophages with respect to control macrophages, after lps stimulation. in conclusion, our results indicate that gbs survive in macrophages  and impairment of pkc signal transduction contributes to their intracellular survival.

TI  == incidence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell counts.
AB  == incidence of clinical mastitis was studied in 274 herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell count (scc). mean incidence rate of clinical mastitis was 0.278, 0.257, and 0.252 cases per 365 cow-days at risk in herds with low (< or = 150,000), medium (150,000 to 250,000), and high (250,000 to 400,000 cells/ml) bulk milk scc, respectively. the incidence rate of clinical mastitis was not different among the three categories. variance in the incidence of clinical mastitis among herds increased as bulk milk scc decreased. clinical mastitis caused by gram-negative pathogens, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., or pseudomonas spp., occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk scc. clinical mastitis caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk scc. systemic signs of illness caused by clinical mastitis occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk scc. both overall culling rate and culling rate for clinical mastitis were not different among groups catergorized by bulk milk scc.  in herds with a high bulk milk scc, however, more cows that produced milk with a  high scc were culled. in herds with a low bulk milk scc, more cows were culled for teat lesions, milkability, udder shape, fertility, and character than were cows in herds with a high bulk milk scc. in herds with a low bulk milk scc, cows  were also culled more for export and production reasons.

TI  == a broad-host-range mobilizable shuttle vector for the construction of transcriptional fusions to beta-galactosidase in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a low-copy-number vector designated ptcv-lac has been constructed to provide a convenient system to analyze regulatory elements in gram-positive bacteria. the main components of this vector are: (i) the origins of replication of pacyc184 and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pam beta 1, (ii) erythromycin- and kanamycin-resistance-encoding genes for selection in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, (iii) the transfer origin of the incp plasmid rk2, and (iv) a promoterless beta-galactosidase-encoding lacz gene with a gram-positive ribosome binding site. this 12 kb plasmid is present in gram-positive hosts in three to five copies per chromosome equivalent and contains three unique cloning  sites (ecori, smai, bamhi) for cloning of dna inserts upstream of the lacz gene.  plasmid ptcv-lac and derivatives carrying different promoter fragments have been  transferred by conjugation from an escherichia coli incp mobilizing donor strain  to bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae. these plasmids were structurally stable in these hosts  and the corresponding promoter activities, quantitated by the determination of the beta-galactosidase specific activities, were found to cover at least a 100-fold range in beta-galactosidase values. these results indicate that ptcv-lac should be useful for analysis of gene regulation in a wide range of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == forty-six awassi sheep flocks selected by stratified random sampling were subjected to a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of intramammary  infections, to assess the influence of flock size and parity on the prevalence of somatic cell count (scc) and to identify major udder pathogens. of the 3472 udder halves examined, 29.8% had over 10(6) scc/ml and 0.03% had dry teats due to chronic mastitis. flocks with 30-49 milking ewes (small flock size) were much younger (p < 0.001) than flocks with 50-99 ewes (medium) and flocks with > or = 100 ewes (large). pairwise analysis of the inscc of both halves of the udders revealed significant mean differences for small and large flock size (p < 0.05),  and for medium and large flock size (p < 0.001). mean inscc was lower (p < 0.05)  in samples obtained from the left half compared with samples of the right half of the udder. multiparous ewes had higher (p < 0.001) mean inscc than primiparous ewes. also, ewes with twin lambs had higher (p < 0.001) mean inscc in the right half of the udder compared with single-lamb ewes. samples collected in january (winter) had lower (p < 0.05) mean inscc compared with samples collected in june. the most common organisms isolated from subclinical mastitis cases were coagulase-negative staphylococci (17.8%), e. coli (13.6%), streptococcus agalactiae (6.8%) and staphylococcus aureus (6.8%). of the 46 flocks, 20 were monitored monthly for 9 consecutive months to determine the incidence of clinical mastitis diagnosed by shepherds or/and sheep farmers with major pathogens. the incidence of clinical mastitis (expressed as the number of clinical cases per 100 ewe-months) were 2.1 +/- 1.9 (sd), 1.9 +/- 1.1, and 1.2 +/- 2.1 for small, medium and large flocks size strata, respectively. the overall population estimate was 1.7 +/- 0.02 cases per 100 ewe-months. the most-common clinical isolates were s.  aureus (22% of all clinical isolates) and e. coli (14.2%).

AB  == supplementing the feed of selenium-deficient diary cows with selenium (se)-yeast  or selenite at a level of 0.2 p.p.m. induced self-cure of subclinical mastitis; the prevalence of quarters harbouring subclinical mastitis (bacteriological criteria) decreased to about one half during the 8 week supplementation period. three phenomena became apparent to explain the beneficial effect of selenium on mastitis: 1. the recruitment of phagocytes to the infected milk compartment of the udder was improved due to se-supplementation; the correlation between infection and the respective inflammatory response, as indicated by the somatic cell count (scc) and the n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity (nagase) of milk, was poor in selenium-deficient cows. selenium supplementation significantly improved the correlation; 2. selenium supplementation induced an unspecified antibacterial activity in milk lactoserum (whey), restricting in vitro growth of  the mastitis pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus uberis, bacterial growth rates in whey samples became inversely correlated with the respective blood glutathione peroxidase activities (gsh-px); and 3. selenium supplementation had an effect on redox activities and sulfhydryl activities in whey. these changes were correlated with  in vitro bacterial growth rates.

TI  == neonatal early-onset escherichia coli disease. the effect of intrapartum ampicillin.
AB  == background: maternal intrapartum ampicillin has been recommended for the prevention of neonatal group b streptococcal disease. objectives: to assess the effect of this practice, if any, on neonatal early-onset escherichia coli infection and to delineate the clinical characteristics of infected neonates. patients and methods: all neonates with early-onset e coli infection who were born at cook county children's hospital, chicago, ill, from january 1, 1982, through december 31, 1993, were identified from a microbiological register of all neonatal bacteremias and infections. because intrapartum ampicillin use increased in our hospital since 1988, infection and case fatality rates from 1982 through 1987 (period 1) were compared with data from 1988 through 1993 (period 2). we studied maternal risk factors, clinical characteristics of infected neonates, and microbiological sensitivities of e coli isolates. results: early-onset e coli infection was diagnosed in 30 of 61,498 live births. the overall infection rate (0.49 per 1000 live births) did not change significantly during the 2 time periods (0.37 per 1000 live births during period 1 vs 0.62 per 1000 live births during period 2, p = .21; chi 2 test); however, there was an increase in the infection rate in neonates weighing between 1501 and 2500 g. infected neonates had a clinical syndrome that was indistinguishable from early-onset group b streptococcal infection; respiratory distress was the single most frequent finding in 73% (22/30) infected neonates. an increase in the proportion of infections caused by ampicillin-resistant e coli was observed during period 2 (12/18) compared with period 1 (3/12, p = .03; fisher exact test). during period  2, 61% (11/18) of mothers of infected neonates received intrapartum ampicillin compared with 17% (2/12; p = .02) during period 1. overall, a higher proportion of neonates born to ampicillin-treated women had ampicillin-resistant infection (12/13 vs 3/17; p < .001). mothers of 10 of 15 neonates with ampicillin-resistant infection had received more than 2 doses of intrapartum ampicillin. the difference between the prevalence of intrapartum fever in mothers with sensitive  organisms (40%, or 6/15) and resistant organisms (93%, or 14/15) was also significant (p = .003). all 6 early-onset e coli-related deaths were due to ampicillin-resistant organisms; 4 of the 6 mothers received intrapartum ampicillin. conclusions: we have shown a shift of early-onset e coli infection from a less fulminant disease caused by ampicillin-sensitive organisms to a more  fulminant disease caused by ampicillin-resistant organisms. increased use of maternal intrapartum ampicillin therapy may account for these changes. in the absence of evidence for group b streptococcal disease, clinicians should consider the possibility of ampicillin-resistant e coli infection in critically ill neonates born to women with a history of intrapartum fever and treatment with intrapartum ampicillin.

AB  == a strain of streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. in pcr assays, total genomic dna from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. ecori-digested genomic dna from this strain  was cloned into lambda zap ii to construct a library of s. agalactiae genomic dna. a clone, paes63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in escherichia coli was recovered. deletion derivatives of paes63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into e. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. this putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described mef pump in  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent msra pump in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. its gene has been designated mrea (for macrolide resistance efflux).

TI  == [trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

TI  == analysis of promoters in borrelia burgdorferi by use of a transiently expressed reporter gene.
AB  == a transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) expression system was developed for borrelia burgdorferi. an escherichia coli vector containing a promoterless streptococcus agalactiae cat gene was constructed. promoters for ospa, ospc, and flab were placed upstream of this cat gene, and cat assays were performed in e. coli from these stably maintained plasmids. the plasmids with putative promoters ospa and flab were found to be approximately 20-fold more active than were the plasmids with ospc or no promoter. the level of activity correlated well with the resistance to chloramphenicol that each plasmid provided. next, the nonreplicative plasmid constructs were transformed by electroporation into b. burgdorferi. cat assays were performed by both thin-layer chromatography and the fluor diffusion method. measurement of cat activity demonstrated that the ospa promoter was again about 20-fold more active than the  promoterless cat gene. the flab and ospc promoters increased the activity seven-  and threefold, respectively, over that with the promoterless construct. this simple transient-expression assay was shown to be an effective method to study promoter function in b. burgdorferi in the absence of a well-developed genetic system.

TI  == new genetic techniques for group b streptococci: high-efficiency transformation,  maintenance of temperature-sensitive pwv01 plasmids, and mutagenesis with tn917.
AB  == three techniques were developed to improve the genetic manipulation of group b streptococci (gbs). we first optimized a protocol for transformation of gbs by electroporation, which provided transformation efficiencies of 10(5) cfu/microgram. variables that influenced the transformation efficiency were the glycine content of the competent cell growth media, the electric field strength during electroporation, the electroporation buffer composition, the host origin of the transforming plasmid, and the concentration of selective antibiotic at the final plating. our transformation protocol provides an efficiency sufficient for  cloning from ligation reactions directly into gbs, obviating an intermediate host such as escherichia coli. second, temperature-sensitive plasmids of the pwv01 lineage were shown to transform gbs, and their temperature-sensitive replication  was confirmed. lastly, the temperature-sensitive pwv01 plasmid ptv1ok, which contains tn917, was used as a transposon delivery vector for the construction of  genomic tn917 mutant libraries. we have shown, for the first time, that tn917 transposes to the gbs chromosome and at a frequency of 10(-3)/cfu. furthermore, representative clones from a tn917 library contained single transposon insertions that were randomly located throughout the chromosome. these techniques should provide useful methods for cloning, mutagenesis, and characterization of genes from gbs.

TI  == a prospective study of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in southern israel.
AB  == objective: to study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the negev area of southern israel. design: a prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the soroka university medical center. results: two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. during this period 70,709 births (59% jews and 41% bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. one hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in jewish neonates (p < 0.001). twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between days 8 and 28. a total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. fifty-seven of all isolates were gram-negative organisms (mainly klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and escherichia coli (16%)). gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. although e. coli was the most frequently recovered gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, klebsiella and enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated gram-negative organisms  in nosocomial late onset sepsis. all staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in  late onset sepsis were nosocomial. the incidence of streptococcus agalactiae was  3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. all cases of streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in bedouins. conclusions: neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern israel are similar to those reported in western europe and the united states. the incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for bedouins than for jewish neonates. the distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern israel and although gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, s. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. in southern israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.

TI  == blood-brain barrier permeability during the development of experimental bacterial meningitis in the rat.
AB  == in an attempt to examine whether routes of bacterial entry into the central nervous system have any bearing on subsequent changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (csf) penetration of circulating 125i-albumin in two different models of experimental meningitis due to k1 escherichia coli, type iii group b streptococcus, or haemophilus influenzae type  b in infant rats: hematogenous meningitis subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation  of bacteria vs meningitis induced by direct inoculation of bacteria into the csf  via the cisterna magna. in the model of hematogenous meningitis, the mean csf penetration was significantly greater in animals with h. influenzae type b meningitis than in those with meningitis due to k1 e. coli or type iii group b streptococcus. in contrast, the mean csf penetration was significantly enhanced in all animals with meningitis induced by intracisternal inoculation regardless of infecting pathogens. tumor necrosis factor activity in csf appeared to correlate with the functional penetration of circulating albumin across the blood-brain barrier in both models of experimental meningitis. these findings suggest that the alterations of blood-brain barrier permeability during development of experimental meningitis may vary for different models of inducing  meningitis and that the mechanisms responsible for these different permeability changes may be multifactorial.

TI  == the rib element in the goag-pspf intergenic region of escherichia coli.
AB  == the sequence (2,700 bp) between the aldh and pspf genes of escherichia coli was determined. the pspf gene encodes a sigma54 transcriptional activator of the phage shock protein (psp) operon (pspa to pspe). downstream of the pspf transcribed region are two open reading frames (orfs), ordl and goag, convergently oriented with respect to pspf. these two orfs, together with the adjacent aldh gene, may constitute a novel operon (aldh-ordl-goag). the goag-pspf intergenic region contains a complex extragenic mosaic element, rib. the structure of this rib element, which belongs to the bime-1 family, is y(rep1) > 16 < z1(rep2), where y and z1 are palindromic units and the central 16 bases contain an l motif with an ihf consensus sequence. dna fragments containing the l motif of the psp rib element effectively bind integration host factor (ihf), while the y palindromic unit (rep1) of the same rib element binds dna gyrase weakly. computer prediction of the pspf mrna secondary structure suggested that the transcribed stem-loop structures formed by the 3'-flanking region of the pspf transcript containing the rib element can stabilize and protect pspf mrna. analysis of pspf steady-state mrna levels showed that transcripts with an intact  rib element are much more abundant than those truncated at the 3' end by deletion of either the entire rib element or a single z1 sequence (rep2). thus, the pspf 3'-flanking region containing the rib element has an important role in the stabilization of the pspf transcript.

TI  == sequence analysis and characterization of pom1, a small cryptic plasmid from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for butyrivibrios.
AB  == as a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. we present here the complete nucleotide sequence of butyrivibrio plasmid pom1, which was isolated from b. fibrisolvens bu49. while it is very similar in size to the previously characterized butyrivibrio plasmids prjf1 and prjf2, pom1 exhibits a restriction pattern which  is quite distinct. analysis of sequence data reveals that pom1 contains only two  open reading frames of significant length (orf1 and orf2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. the protein encoded in orf1 shows  homologies with pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, lactobacillus plantarum, and bacillus thuringiensis. the putative translation product of orf2, on the other hand, resembles rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the staphylococcus plasmid psn2 is a prototype. unlike the other characterized-butyrivibrio plasmids, pom1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pom1 has been used in the construction of a new escherichia coli-b. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, psmerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into b. fibrisolvens harboring the prjf1 plasmid.

TI  == characterization of two distinct opsonic and protective epitopes within the alpha c protein of the group b streptococcus.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is a major cause of neonatal sepsis, meningitis in early infancy, postpartum endometritis, and serious invasive infections in adults in the united states. we previously cloned, sequenced, and characterized the alpha antigen gene, bca, and showed that the alpha c protein of gbs is a trypsin-resistant, surface-associated polypeptide that contains a signal sequence, a unique n terminus, nine identical tandem repeats, and a c-terminal membrane anchor structure. polyclonal antiserum raised to the recombinant alpha c protein and an opsonic monoclonal antibody, 4g8, raised to the native protein from gbs have been shown to be protective in a mouse model. the binding site of 4g8 has now been localized to the tandem repeat region of the alpha c protein. to determine whether the n terminus of the alpha c protein contains additional opsonic and/or protective epitopes, the sequence corresponding to the alpha c protein n terminus was subcloned into a pet vector, the expressed peptide from escherichia coli was purified by ni2+ affinity chromatography, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised to the purified recombinant peptide. antibodies to the alpha c protein n terminus were shown to be opsonic by an in vitro opsonophagocytosis assay. in addition, 69% of newborn mouse pups from mothers passively immunized with the antiserum to the recombinant n-terminal polypeptide  of the alpha c protein were protected against lethal challenge with gbs a909. these data indicate that at least two distinct regions of the alpha c protein, the n terminus and the tandem repeat region, contain opsonic and protective epitopes.

AB  == variable expression of repeating units of the protective alpha c proteins among clinical isolates of group b streptococci (gbs) may have implications for vaccine development. in this study, alpha c protein genes containing various numbers of repeats (1,2,9, and 16) were cloned in a t7 overexpression vector in escherichia  coli. expression was induced by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and proteins were purified by anion-exchange, gel filtration, or affinity chromatography or by isoelectric focusing. rabbits were immunized with purified 1-,2-,9-, or 16-repeat proteins. all proteins appeared to be highly immunogenic.  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition with 9-repeat protein as the coating antigen and 9-repeat-antigen-elicited antiserum showed that a 200-fold-higher concentration of 1-repeat antigen than of 9- or 16-repeat antigen was required for 50% inhibition of antibody-antigen binding. the concentration of 2-repeat antigen required for 50% inhibition was intermediate relative to the concentrations of 1- and 9-repeat antigens. these results suggested that antibodies to 9-repeat antigen recognized predominantly a conformational epitope(s) contained in proteins with higher numbers of repeats (9 or 16) but lost considerable binding affinities for an epitope(s) contained in alpha c proteins with fewer repeats (1 or 2). similar results were obtained with antiserum to 16-repeat antigen. however, antibodies to 1- and 2-repeat antigens recognized 1-,2-,9-,and 16-repeat antigens with equal binding affinities. this finding suggested that 1- and 2-repeat-elicited antibodies recognized an epitope(s) on individual repeats. loss of repeating units from the alpha c proteins may result in decreased protection because the loss of epitopes (including conformational epitopes) gives the microorganisms the opportunity to escape host antibodies. if 1- and 2-repeat-elicited antibodies bind all alpha c proteins with equal affinity, regardless of their repeat number, they may prevent gbs strains with fewer repeats from escaping host immunity. protection data obtained with antisera to the proteins with different repeat numbers support this hypothesis: mouse pups challenged with gbs strain a909 were better protected when immunized with 1- or 2-repeat-elicited antiserum (76 and 75%, respectively) than  when immunized with 9- or 16-repeat-elicited antiserum (41 and 48%, respectively).

TI  == [evaluation of urine screening in healthy infants].
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate urine screening in healthy infants. patients and methods: a retrospective analysis was made of the medical records of all children born between june 1, 1993 and may 31, 1995 who are registered at a primary care center in the south of madrid. two hundred eighty-eight 1-month-old babies were tested (131 boys and 157 girls) with a urine dipstick (combur-9 test) and a uroculture was performed in those children whose test showed an alteration in the dipstick. in patients with urinary tract infection, the study was completed with radiographic procedures results: of all tests carried out, only 61 were positive (21.1%) and urinary tract infection was  confirmed in 9 patients (14%). a grade ii vesicoureteral reflux was detected in only one girl (1.6% of patients with positive test and 0.3% of all the infants studied). the follow up of the 227 infants with initial negative screening found  urinary tract infections in 9 of them (3.9%), without malformations of the genitourinary tract. conclusions: this study has proven a low positive predictive value of the urine dipstick (1.6%) for urine screening. the authors believe that  this screening should be reserved for infants with symptoms of urinary tract infection or at risk groups of children in order to avoid the study and treatment of infants with asymptomatic bacteria.

TI  == penetration of cefpodoxime into uterine and vaginal secretions from postpartum women after a single oral dose of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr) in the treatment of puerperal infection and obtained the following results. (i) the susceptibilities  of 124 clinical isolates from 85 uterine lochia samples were determined. the mic  at which the growth of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis isolates was inhibited by 90% (mic90) was 0.39 micrograms/ml or less. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 3.13 micrograms/ml. (ii) seven puerperal women received 200 mg of cpdx-pr orally. the cpdx concentration in the  lochias in the uterine cavity was not statistically different from that in the vagina, suggesting that the vaginal samples, which can be obtained more safely and aseptically, can be substituted for the uterine samples. the cpdx concentration in cubital venous blood reached a peak of 1.61 micrograms/ml at 3 hours after cpdx-pr administration. the cpdx concentration in the lochias gradually increased and reached a peak of 1.20 micrograms/ml in the uterine cavity and 1.27 micrograms/ml in the vagina at 5 h after drug administration and  gradually declined thereafter. these results suggest that cpdx-pr, with its good  transfer to the lochia and its potent antimicrobial activity, is a promising drug for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of puerperal infections caused by  susceptible organisms.

TI  == volume of blood required to detect common neonatal pathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the minimum volume of blood and the absolute number of organisms required for detection of bacteremia and fungemia by an automated colorimetric blood culture system (bact/alert, organon teknika). design: common neonatal pathogens, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus (gbs): one american type culture collection (atcc) strain and one clinical isolate), staphylococcus epidermidis, and candida albicans, were seeded  into blood to produce bacteremia or fungemia with low colony counts (1 to 3 colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter) and ultra-low colony counts (<1 cfu/ml). for each organism, 96 culture bottles were inoculated with either 0.25,  0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 ml of the two seeded blood concentrations. blood culture bottles were incubated in the bact/alert device for 5 days, and time to positivity was noted when applicable. all bottles were subcultured on plated media. data analysis: the poisson statistic was used to calculate the probability of finding  at least one viable cfu per inoculated culture bottle. the fraction of culture bottles with positive findings per group was divided by the probability of one or more organisms present to give the positivity index. results: plated subculture identified no growth of organisms not detected by the colorimetric detection system. the false-positive rate for the automated device was less than 1%. the positivity index for the gbs clinical isolate was 1.13, for the gbs atcc isolate  0.96, for s. epidermidis 0.94, for c. albicans 0.97, and for e. coli 0.95. there  was a statistically significant difference with time to positivity and inocula volume (p <0.01), but the difference was not clinically important. conclusions: if one or two viable colony-forming units are in the blood inoculated into culture media, the bact/alert system will detect growth rapidly. because there appears to be a sizable subset of neonates who are at risk of sepsis with a colony count less than 4 cfu/ml, then a 0.5 ml inoculum of blood into the culture media is inadequate for sensitive and timely detection of bacteremia. one to two  milliliters of blood should increase microorganism recovery in the face of low-colony-count sepsis.

TI  == interleukin-6 production by human neonatal monocytes stimulated by type iii group b streptococci.
AB  == the subcellular components of type iii group b streptococci (gbs) that contribute to the host inflammatory response were determined by measuring production of the  proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (il)-6 by cord blood monocytes. monocytes were stimulated with encapsulated (coh1) or unencapsulated (coh1-13) whole type iii gbs or with purified gbs components, including type iii capsular polysaccharide (iii-ps), group b antigen (gb-ag), lipoteichoic acid (lta), or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. monocytes exposed to coh1 and coh1-13 released similar amounts of il-6. gbs iii-ps, gb-ag, and lta each induced il-6. however, il-6 release by monocytes was significantly greater after stimulation by gb-ag than by iii-ps or lta (p < .05). sera from 16 neonates with systemic gbs disease had il-6 levels of 8 pg/ml to 4.28 ng/ml. gb-ag is a potent inducer of il-6 and may play an important role in tissue inflammation during gbs infection.

TI  == conservation of the c5a peptidase genes in group a and b streptococci.
AB  == the chromosome of group b streptococci (gbs) contains a gene which is related to  the c5a peptidase gene (scpa) of group a streptococci (gas). scpa encodes a surface-associated peptidase (group a streptococcal c5a peptidase [scpa]) which specifically cleaves c5a, a major chemoattractant generated in serum by activation of complement. the entire scpa-like gene (scpb) was cloned from a gbs  strain and sequenced. the gene encodes an open reading frame of 3,450 bp, which corresponds to a deduced protein (scpb) of 1,150 amino acids with a molecular weight of 126,237 da. nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of scpb were found to be highly homologous to those of scpas from gas. unexpectedly, scpa12 is more similar to scpb than to another gas gene, scpa49. the sequence 5' of the open reading frame, including transcription start and a termination site in the signal sequence, is also similar to that of scpa, although less conserved than the coding sequences. the near identity of gbs and gas peptidases is consistent with horizontal transmission of the scp gene between these species. recombinant scpb was expressed in escherichia coli by using the expression vector plasmid pgex-4t-1 and was shown to be identical in size to the enzyme extracted from the  parental gbs strain 78-471.

TI  == characterization of cpsf and its product cmp-n-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase,  a group b streptococcal enzyme that can function in k1 capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in escherichia coli.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is the foremost cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the united states. a major virulence factor for gbs is its capsular polysaccharide, a high molecular weight polymer of branched oligosaccharide subunits. n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac or sialic acid), at the end of the polysaccharide side chains, is critical to the virulence function of the capsular polysaccharide. neu5ac must be activated by cmp-neu5ac synthetase before it is incorporated into the polymer. we showed previously that a transposon mutant of a serotype iii gbs strain which had no detectable capsular neu5ac was deficient in  cmp-neu5ac-synthetase activity (wessels et al., 1992). in this paper, we report the identification and characterization of cpsf, a gene interrupted by transposon insertion in the previously described neu5ac-deficient mutant. the predicted amino acid sequence of the cpsf gene product shares 57% similarity and 37% identity with cmp-neu5ac synthase encoded by the escherichia coli k1 gene, neua.  the enzymatic function of the protein encoded by cpsf was established by cloning  the gene e. coli under the control of the t7 polymerase/promoter. lysates of e. coli in which the cpsf gene product was expressed, catalysed the condensation of  ctp with neu5ac to form cmp-neu5ac. in addition, when cmp-neu5ac synthetase-deficient mutant of e. coli k1 was transformed with cpsf, k1 antigen expression was restored. we concluded that cpsf encodes cmp-neu5ac synthetase in  type iii gbs, and that the gbs enzyme can function in the capsule-synthesis of a  heterologous bacterial species.

TI  == diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

TI  == effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. we examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (alveofact, survanta and exosurf) approved for treatment  of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on legionella pneumophila serogroup i as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. addition of survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined e. coli strains. as opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the  exception of exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of  group b streptococci. though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == infection of the pancreatic duct following pancreas transplantation with bladder  drainage.
AB  == combined kidney-pancreas transplantation represents a widely accepted therapy for endstage diabetic nephropathy. drainage of the pancreatic juice into the urinary  bladder is the preferred surgical technique in most centers. between january 1987 and december 1994 a total of 85 pancreas transplantations with pancreatocystostomy were performed at the innsbruck university hospital. in all cases a polyvinylcatheter was placed into the pancreatic duct and drained transvesically to the exterior. during several weeks after transplantation pure pancreatic juice was harvested for immunological and microbiological monitoring.  whenever a patient required antibiotic treatment, antibiotic concentrations in pancreatic juice, urine or serum were determined by means of a biological test system using bacillus subtilis. nine different atcc bacterial strains were incubated in pancreatic juice collected from transplant recipients and tested for their multiplication rate. thirteen patients acquired an infection of the pancreatic duct. non-fermentative bacteria, gram-negative rods, enterococcus spp. and candida spp. were the most often isolated organisms. the in vitro tests revealed that pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and escherichia coli grew very well whereas streptococcus agalactiae was unable to multiply in pancreatic juice. ampicillin/sulbactam was found to be excreted in high concentrations into the pancreatic juice. many other tested antibiotics (cephalosporins, carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides) achieved levels below the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for most bacteria. antibiotic treatment was required for up to 5 weeks to eliminate the pathogens from the pancreas but was successful in 11 out of the 13 patients at the end. the results  of this study led to changes in our antibiotic policy and helped to improve the results after pancreatic transplantation.

TI  == bactericidal activity of the bovine myeloperoxidase system against bacteria associated with mastitis.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is a lysosomal enzyme found in the primary granules of mammalian neutrophils. together with mpo, peroxide and halide form a system of defense against bacteria. the present investigation was undertaken to study the bactericidal effects of the bovine-mpo/peroxide/halide system on pathogenic bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. we demonstrated that mpo together with  oxidizing agents generated by xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine and chloride form a  potent antibacterial system against the common udder pathogens staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and escherichia coli in a synthetic medium. however, when milk was added to the reaction mixture, the bactericidal properties of this enzyme system  were completely inhibited. loss of bactericidal activity in the milk-containing cultures was unable to be restored by increasing the concentration of mpo. nor did an increase in concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, or the replacement of the above-mentioned peroxidase generating system with a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide, significantly elevated the bactericidal activity that was inhibited by milk. the addition of bovine serum albumin to the  synthetic medium reduced the bactericidal activity of the mpo/peroxide/chloride system in a dose-dependent manner. therefore, milk proteins probably form adducts with strong bactericidal agents that are generated by the mpo system and thereby  reduce the bactericidal potential of this system.

TI  == a fluorometric beta-glucuronidase assay for analysis of bacterial growth in milk.
AB  == the growth of common mastitis-causing bacteria in milk was followed by a fluorometric technique based on the release of fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone  (4-mu) from 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-glucuronide by the beta-glucuronidase of  bacterial or milk origin. three of four escherichia coli strains, all four strains of streptococcus uberis (4/4) and streptococcus agalactiae (4/4) produced beta-glucuronidase. four staphylococcus aureus strains (4/4) and one e. coli strain, though unable to produce the enzyme, activated the milk beta-glucuronidase most probably by lowering the ph of bacterial cultures in milk for optimum activity of the indigenous enzyme. the beta-glucuronidase of milk, str. uberis and str. agalactiae origin had similar optimum ph ranges (5.3-6.6) while e. coli beta-glucuronidase was more active at neutral or slightly alkaline  ph (6.8-7.7). the increase of beta-glucuronidase activity in milk cultures of e.  coli, str. uberis, str. agalactiae and s. aureus seemed to parallel the increase  of colony forming units and were dependent on the inoculum size. the time to reach a predetermined enzyme threshold in e. coli-milk cultures showed excellent  linear relationship with the inoculum size.

TI  == effect of surfactant on nitroblue tetrazolium reduction of polymorphonuclear leucocytes stimulated with type ia group b streptococci.
AB  == activation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn) was investigated after incubation of adult human pmn and group b streptococci (gbs) type ia with a type-specific polyclonal antiserum and a modified porcine surfactant (curosurf).  the level of oxidative metabolism of pmn was studied using a micromethod modification of the nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt) reduction test. gbs alone did not stimulate significant oxygen metabolite release from pmn, and incubation of pmn with surfactant alone resulted in decreased nbt reduction. after opsonization of  gbs with a specific antibody, pmn were activated and the increased oxygen metabolite release was not suppressed when surfactant was added to the system. we conclude that the encapsulated gbs strain investigated needs opsonization with specific antibody to increase oxidative metabolism of pmn, and that incubation of pmn and opsonized gbs with surfactant does not interfere with nbt reduction.

AB  == the tetracycline-resistance (tcr) determinant of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pjh1 has been identified and located on a 2.2-kb rsai-ecori fragment. the fragment was cloned in escherichia coli, and specified tcr in this host. the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (orf) of 1374 bp, designated tetl. the nt sequence of tetl from pjh1 was identical to that of the tetl present on pls1 from streptococcus agalactiae. upstream of the pjh1 tetl, part of another orf was found that, except for two single-nt substitutions, was identical to an iso-iss1 element from lactococcus lactis. hybridization studies indicated the presence of several iss1-like elements in plasmid pjh1, but not on the en. faecalis chromosome. to study its usefulness as a marker in gram+ organisms, the pjh1 tetl was cloned on  the broad-host-range plasmid pnz124, resulting in pnz280, that was found to give  resistance to 40 micrograms tc/ml in lc. lactis and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == [udder disinfection and mastitis in cattle: a literature review].
AB  == postmilking teat disinfection is accepted as an important part of standard preventive measures against mastitis in dairy cattle. the efficacy of postmilking teat disinfection against infections with contagious pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae is beyond doubt. however, the  efficacy of teat disinfection against infections with environmental pathogens such as escherichia coli is disputed, and a negative effect has even been described in some situations. this article reviews the practice of teat disinfection in dairy cattle. premilking and postmilking teat disinfection are discussed, as is the efficacy, different ways of teat disinfection, and different disinfectants. it is concluded that post-milking teat disinfection is an effective management measure in most herds. selection of teat disinfectants should be based on proven efficacy, which is required for registration of the preparation as a veterinary medical product in the netherlands.

TI  == ability of normal vaginal flora to produce detectable phosphatidylglycerol in amniotic fluid in vitro.
AB  == objective: to determine if bacteria are capable of producing phosphatidylglycerol in amniotic fluid (af) and the number of colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria necessary to produce this result. methods: eleven species of bacteria and one species of yeast, common to the female genital tract and implicated in chorioamnionitis, were selected. amniotic fluid was collected from 21 women and inoculated with 10(8) cfu/ml of each isolate. aliquots of af were tested at 0, 4, 12, and 24 hours for colony counts and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol by thin-layer chromatography. results: the mean gestational age (+/- standard deviation) of the 21 study patients was 33 weeks and 1 day (+/- 4 weeks). among the 12 species studied, escherichia coli produced phosphatidylglycerol, at a concentration of 1.75 x 10(8) cfu/ml, beginning 12 hours after incubation. conclusion: escherichia coli is capable of producing phosphatidylglycerol in af in vitro and is present in the vagina in 24% of normal pregnant patients. our findings question the validity of using vaginal pool af specimens for phosphatidylglycerol determination. therefore, we recommend that patients presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes be evaluated by amniocentesis to determine fetal lung maturity with phosphatidylglycerol and the  lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio.

TI  == group b streptococcus and e. coli lps-induced no-dependent hyporesponsiveness to  noradrenaline in isolated intrapulmonary arteries of neonatal piglets.
AB  == 1. the effects of endotoxin (e. coli lipopolysaccharide, lps) and heat inactivated group b streptococcus (gbs) were studied on the contractile responses to noradrenaline (na) in isolated pulmonary arteries and on the activity of the constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthase (nos) in lung fragments of neonatal piglets. 2. short-term (< or = 5 h) incubation with lps (1 micrograms ml-1) or gbs (3 x 10(7) colonies forming units ml-1) did not modify the vascular  responsiveness to na (10(-8) m-10(-4) m) in isolated intrapulmonary arteries. however, long-term incubation (20 h) with lps or gbs produced a significant reduction in the maximal contractile responses and shifted the concentration-response curve for na downwards. 3. endothelium removal or the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor meclofenamate (10(-5) m) did not affect the gbs- and lps-induced hyporesponsiveness to na. 4. the presence of the nitric oxide (no) precursor, l-arginine (10(-5) m), 30 min prior to the contractility challenge increased the lps- and gbs-induced pulmonary vascular hyporesponsiveness to na. in contrast, the addition, prior to the challenge with na, of the nos inhibitor ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name, 10(-4) m) or coincubation with dexamethasone (3 x 10(-6) m), a potent inhibitor of the induction of nos, or with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10(-5) m) completely restored the  reactivity to na in lps- and gbs-treated pulmonary arteries. 5. the incubation for 20 h of lung fragments with lps and gbs produced a significant increase in the ca2+-independent (inducible) nos activity determined by the conversion of radiolabelled l-arginine to citrulline, but did not modify the constitutive nos activity. this nos induction was abolished by coincubation with dexamethasone (3  x 10-6 m).6. these results demonstrated that prolonged incubation with gbs and lps causes an induction of nos activity which results in a reduced vascular responsiveness to na in pulmonary arteries of neonatal piglets. thus, induction of nos seems to be responsible for the delayed pulmonary vascular hyporesponsiveness induced by gbs (a gram-positive) and e. coli (a gram-negative), the most common causal agents of neonatal sepsis.

AB  == neonatal group b streptococcal (gbs) sepsis and pneumonia cause lung endothelial  cell injury. gbs invasion of the lung endothelium may be a mechanism for injury and the release of vasoactive eicosanoids. pulmonary artery endothelial cells (paec) and lung microvascular endothelial cells (lmvec) were isolated from neonatal piglets and were characterized as endothelial on the basis of morphology, uptake of acyl low-density lipoprotein, factor viii staining, and formation of tube-like structures on matrigel. paec and lmvec monolayers were infected with coh-1 (parent gbs strain), isogenic mutants of coh-1 devoid of capsular sialic acid or all capsular polysaccharide, or a noninvasive escherichia coli strain, dh5 alpha. intracellular gbs were assayed by plate counting of colony-forming units resistant to incubation with extracellular antibiotics. all  gbs strains invaded lmvec significantly more than paec, showing that the site of  lung endothelial cell origin influences invasion. dh5 alpha was not invasive in either cell type. both isogenic mutants invaded paec and lmvec more than coh-1 did, showing that gbs capsular polysaccharide attenuates invasion. live gbs caused both lmvec and paec injury as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release; heat-killed gbs and dh5 alpha caused no significant injury. supernatants from paec and lmvec were assayed by radioimmunoassay for prostaglandin e2 (pge2), the  stable metabolite of prostacyclin (6-keto-pgf1 alpha), and the thromboxane metabolite thromoxane b2. at 4 h, live coh-1 caused no significant increases in eicosanoids from both paec and lmvec. at 16 h, live coh-1, but not heat-killed coh-1, caused a significant increase in 6-keto-pgf1 alpha greater than pge2 from  lmvec, but not paec. we conclude that live gbs injure and invade the lung microvascular endothelium and induce release of prostacyclin and pge2. we postulate that gbs invasion and injury of the lung microvasculature contribute to the pathogenesis of gbs disease.

TI  == cloning and expression of the gene for group b streptococcal hyaluronate lyase.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are a major cause of serious human perinatal infections. most clinical isolates of gbs secrete hyaluronate lyase, and production of high levels of the enzyme has been associated with strain virulence. degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed on the basis of the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides prepared from the purified enzyme, permitted the polymerase chain reaction amplification from gbs chromosomal dna of a 363-base pair internal dna fragment of the gbs hyaluronate lyase gene (hylb). this dna fragment was used as a probe to screen a lambda phage library of gbs chromosomal dna fragments. sequence analysis of positive clones identified an open reading frame capable of coding for a 111-kda protein. since no single clone was found to contain the entire gene it was necessary to reconstruct the gene from two plasmids containing inserts with suitable overlapping sequences. when this reconstructed gene was transformed into escherichia coli, high level expression of hyaluronate lyase activity was obtained.

TI  == characterization of cmp-n-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase of group b streptococci.
AB  == the capsular polysaccharide is a critical virulence factor for group b streptococci associated with human infections, yet little is known about capsule  biosynthesis. we detected cmp-neu5ac synthetase, the enzyme which activates n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac, or sialic acid) for transfer to the nascent capsular polysaccharide, in multiple group b streptococcus serotypes, all of which elaborate capsules containing neu5ac. cmp-neu5ac synthetase isolated from a high-producing type ib strain was purified 87-fold. the enzyme had apparent km values of 7.6 for neu5ac and 1.4 for ctp and a ph optimum of 8.3 to 9.4, required magnesium, and was stimulated by dithiothreitol. this is the first characterization of an enzyme involved in group b streptococcus capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis.

TI  == opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

TI  == molecular characterization of the cfb gene encoding group b streptococcal camp-factor.
AB  == an internal fragment of the cfb gene from group b streptococcal (gbs) strain r268 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using degenerate primers with sequences derived from the camp-factor amino acid (aa) sequence of gbs strain nctc8181 [ruhlmann et al. (1988) febs lett 235:262-266]. after cloning and sequencing this fragment, the remainder of cfb and the adjacent 5' and 3' sequences were amplified by inverted pcr of genomic dna and directly sequenced from the pcr product. within the 1560 bp sequenced, a complete cfb gene deviating in two deduced aa residues from the published sequence was identified. in addition, the cfbr268 sequence contained a 29-aa leader peptide. using primers directed to the 5' and 3' ends of cfb for pcr, a cfb gene of uniform size could be detected in 19 clinical gbs isolates including three phenotypically camp-negative strains. utilizing northern blot analysis and primer extension assays, the cfbr268 promoter was located and the length of the cfb transcript was assessed at about 1100 bp. in a parallel experiment, no cfb transcript could be detected from the camp-negative gbs strain 74-360. the complete cfbr268 gene and  different portions of its 5' and 3' ends were cloned into the plasmid pjla602 and expressed in e. coli dh5 alpha. the recombinant peptides could be detected by western immunoblots with polyclonal antiserum. only the full-sized recombinant camp-factor was found to exert co-hemolytic activity in a sheep-blood agar assay. this co-hemolytic activity could be inhibited by anti-camp antiserum.

TI  == [epidemiology of primary bacterial meningitis].
AB  == in industrialized countries, the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis is between 5 and 10 cases/10(5) population/year. the highest age-specific attack rates are recorded between 0 and 2 years of age and can reach 100 cases/10(5) population/year or more in some countries. in this range of age,  streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli are responsible for meningitis in neonates whereas haemophilus influenzae, neisseria  meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae cause meningitis in children older than 1 month. h. influenzae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children  but its incidence has declined since the introduction of routine childhood immunization with conjugate vaccines. n. meningitidis is the leading cause of meningitis in teenagers and young adults, whereas s. pneumoniae is responsible for most of meningitis in the elderly. prognosis of bacterial meningitis mainly depends on the type of causative organism and on the age of onset. detailed epidemiologic features of haemophilus, meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis  are provided.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

TI  == neonatal meningitis in england and wales: a review of routine national data.
AB  == the objective of this study was to describe trends in neonatal meningitis in england and wales during the years 1975-91. laboratory reports and, for the years 1983-91, data on statutory notifications and deaths from neonatal meningitis were reviewed. the mean annual total of laboratory reports of neonatal bacterial meningitis 1975-91 was 109 cases (range 69-133) with a slight upward trend apparent in the latter half of the study period. the mean annual number of reports of neonatal viral meningitis was only 14 cases with no trend apparent. the leading bacteria isolated were group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and listeria monocytogenes accounting for 34.1%, 28.5%, and 6.8% of reports, respectively. there was a change in the pattern of causative bacteria from 1981 onwards with the group b streptococcus displacing e coli as the leading cause. with respect to neonatal viral meningitis, echoviruses and coxsackie viruses accounted for 55.4% and 38.6% of cases, respectively. neonatal meningitis was seriously undernotified; the ratio of laboratory reported cases to cases notified ranged from 12:1 in 1985 to 4:1 in 1989. the annual numbers of deaths ranged from 18 to 39. the laboratory reporting system provided the most useful data on secular trends and causative organisms for neonatal meningitis. the slight upward trend in the number of reports of bacterial meningitis merits continued surveillance.

AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == the effects of nonclassic pediatric bacterial pathogens on the usefulness of the  directigen latex agglutination test.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae type b, escherichia coli, neisseria meningitis, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae are classically the predominant meningeal pathogens of children. the directigen latex agglutination test identifies these pathogens by detecting specific antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and urine. the authors tested 1151 specimens from 791 children with suspected meningeal infections. they found that the sensitivity of the directigen test for detecting the five classic csf pathogens of children was 83.3% with csf  and 60% with urine specimens. in detecting all pathogens, however, the sensitivity was only 50% with csf and 37.5% with urine. thus, an increased prevalence of nonclassic pathogens in a pediatric population adversely affects the efficacy of the directigen test for confirming a diagnosis of meningitis and  emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the clinical history and other routine csf tests.

TI  == risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with group b streptococcal urinary infections or urinary antibodies to group b streptococcal and e. coli antigens.
AB  == objective: to establish whether there is an association between preterm delivery  and either group b streptococcal urinary infection or the presence of urinary antibodies to group b streptococcal or e. coli antigens. design: a prospective study with urine culture and antibody measurement performed at the first antenatal visit and at 28 weeks gestation. setting: ninewells hospital, dundee. subjects: two thousand and forty-three women registering consecutively at an antenatal clinic. main outcome measure: delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation. results: no increase in preterm delivery was observed in women with positive urine cultures for group b streptococci either at booking or at 28 weeks, even when confirmed by positive repeat cultures. preterm delivery was more common in women with elevated urinary antibodies to e. coli antigens at booking (relative risk 1.81, 95% ci 1.22-2.68, p = 0.005) and at 28 weeks (relative risk 2.36, 95%  ci 1.60-3.48, p < 0.0001) and to group b streptococcal antigens at 28 weeks (relative risk 2.24, 95% ci 1.46-3.43, p = 0.0003). conclusions: these data do not support previous reports that positive urine cultures for group b streptococci are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. our report of an association between elevated levels of urinary antibodies and preterm delivery is a new finding consistent with the possibility that a local inflammatory response to uro-genital infection may be important in stimulating the onset of preterm labour. the results suggest that screening for urinary antibodies at 28 weeks gestation might help to identify a group of women at increased risk of prematurity.

TI  == adverse perinatal outcome and resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes and group b streptococcus carriage.
AB  == objective: to report a case series of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with  resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the  membranes (prom) and group b streptococcus. methods: maternal and neonatal records were reviewed of four cases in which adverse perinatal outcomes occurred  from resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for either prom or positive group b streptococcal cultures. information on clinical setting, antibiotic usage, maternal and neonatal complications, and maternal and neonatal  cultures was noted. results: all four cases were complicated by prom at 25-35 weeks' gestation. ampicillin or amoxicillin was used in several clinical settings, including therapeutically for the presence of group b streptococcus, presumptively for prom, and prophylactically pending the results of group b streptococcal cultures. clinical chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in all four cases, and in two cases the maternal course was prolonged and complicated by persistent fever and the need for therapy for pelvic vein thrombophlebitis. two neonates died from fulminant clinical sepsis. a third infant, one of a twin gestation, was stillborn, presumably because of sepsis. in three cases, neonatal  and placental cultures revealed escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin; in the  fourth case, klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, with only intermediate sensitivity to ampicillin. conclusion: resistant enterobacteriaceae associated with adverse perinatal outcomes may result from the use of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, after prom. in deciding whether antibiotic therapy for prom or group b streptococcal prophylaxis is appropriate, the value of purported  benefits must be weighed against presumably infrequent but serious outcomes, including neonatal sepsis and death due to selection or overgrowth of resistant organisms.

TI  == infections of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: approach to management.
AB  == implantable cardioverter defibrillators are being used with increasing frequency  for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. nevertheless, no guidelines exist for the management of infections of these devices. we report our experience with infections of these devices and review the english-language literature. in all cases, patients presented with local signs of generator infection; systemic signs of infection and bacteremia were often absent. most infections are due to staphylococcus. risk factors for the development of infection include placement of the device via median sternotomy during another cardiac surgical procedure, reoperation, and intercurrent infection at another site. infections are most reliably treated with full explantation of the device and antibiotics. in rare cases, patients may respond to a combination of intravenous antibiotics and removal and replacement of only the generator.

TI  == neonatal bacterial septicemia in a tropical area. four-year experience in guadeloupe (french west indies).
AB  == during a four-year study (1987-1990) at the neonatal department, university hospital pointe-a-pitre (french west indies), blood culture was systematically performed on all admitted newborns. the incidence of septicemia was 48 of 1000 admissions and 8.9 of 1000 inborn live births. among the 107 neonatal positive blood cultures, group b streptococcus accounted for 37% of blood culture isolates and was the most frequent cause of septicemia. the overall mortality rate was 8.4%. the incidence of neonatal bacterial septicemia was among the high rates reported in the literature. the incidence of neonatal bacterial septicemia is discussed as a public health problem in perinatology in guadeloupe in spite of good medical care. a review of the literature on bacterial septicemia in tropical or developing countries compared to the guadeloupean experience allows speculation that this problem might be underestimated in third world countries.

TI  == radiotelemetry temperature responses of mammary gland and body to intramammary injection of escherichia coli endotoxin or streptococcus agalactiae in lactating  dairy cows.
AB  == to investigate the feasibility of using changes in body or mammary temperature to detect mastitis, radiotransmitters were implanted midway between rear udder quarters and in the peritoneal cavity of 5 holstein cows (1 to 3 months in lactation) housed in an environmental chamber (16 +/- 2 c; lights on 7:00 am to 11:00 pm). after a 6-week control period, escherichia coli endotoxin (0.5 mg) was injected after the morning milking into left rear teat cisterns via the teat canal. wisconsin mastitis test score and somatic cell count in all quarters increased significantly (p < 0.01) by the next milking. effects were greatest in  the endotoxin-exposed quarters. milk yields for all quarters decreased significantly (p < 0.01) by the first milking after endotoxin injection. udder and body temperatures at milkings were similar and were not affected by treatment. when temperatures were averaged for the 5 cows for each of 120 time points/d, average temperatures, relative to time of injection of endotoxin, were  increased by 0.5 c above baseline at 2.75 hours, peaked at +2.9 c at 6.50 hours,  and remained high through 9.25 hours after injection. power spectra calculated for individual cows on a daily basis universally indicated an increase in power at low frequencies on the day of injection. subsequently, streptococcus agalactiae (200 colony-forming units) was injected into right rear teat cisterns. wisconsin mastitis test score increased at the second milking after injection. cell count and quarter milk yield decreased by the third milking. as with endotoxin, injection of s agalactiae could not be detected via a change in temperature at milkings.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == costs of clinical mastitis and mastitis prevention in dairy herds.
AB  == a stratified random sample of 50 ohio dairy herds, monitored for 1 year between march 1988 and may 1989, was used to estimate the component costs of clinical mastitis per cow-year overall and by organism, the component costs of an episode  of clinical mastitis overall and by organism, and the incidence of clinical mastitis by organism. each herd was visited monthly by a veterinarian who conducted on-farm interviews and completed standardized data-collection forms designed to elicit economic information about the on-farm costs of clinical mastitis and mastitis prevention. producers collected milk samples prior to treatment of clinical mastitis cases. culturing methods allowed identification of 18 specific mastitis pathogen classifications. annual costs estimated were on a per cow-year and clinical episode basis. the monthly mean population of cows monitored was 4,068. mastitis prevention cost $14.50/cow-year, whereas the cost incurred by producers because of clinical cases of mastitis was $37.91. organisms prevalent in the cows' environment caused the most costly types of mastitis. disregarding contaminated samples and episodes for which no milk samples were taken, mastitis for which 2 organisms were isolated accounted for 35.5% of costs  of clinical mastitis, followed by cases for which escherichia coli (21.3%) was isolated, cases for which culturing yielded no growth (8.6%), and cases for which esculin-positive streptococcus spp (6.4%), klebsiella spp (5.7%), esculin-negative camp-negative streptococcus spp (5.1%), enterobacter spp (4.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp (4.1%), coagulase-positive staphylococcus spp (3.0%), s agalactiae (2.5%), and bacillus spp (1.2%) were isolated.(abstract  truncated at 250 words)

TI  == correlating infectious outcome with clinical parameters of 1130 consecutive febrile infants aged zero to eight weeks.
AB  == the study objectives were to characterize the infectious outcomes and associated  clinical parameters of a large group of febrile young infants who received outpatient sepsis evaluation. this retrospective review of consecutive cases during a seven-year period was set in an urban pediatric emergency department. febrile infants, aged zero to eight weeks, were the participants. all received a  standard evaluation for sepsis, including complete blood count/blood culture, lumbar puncture/cerebrospinal fluid culture, and urinalysis/urine culture. of 1130 patients, 447 (42%) were aged zero to four weeks, and 683 (58%) were aged four to eight weeks. in 96 cases (8.5%), a bacterial pathogen was isolated by culture of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or stool; 58% were aged zero to four weeks and 42% were aged four to eight weeks. the rate of positive cultures per patient age was doubled in those aged zero to four weeks (12%) compared with  those aged four to eight weeks (6%). the 49 cases of invasive bacterial infections (bacterial meningitis/bacteremia) were most commonly associated with lower degrees of fever, as slightly over one half (25/49) had temperature < 39 degrees c. the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection were group b streptococcus and escherichia coli, accounting for 33 of 49 cases (67%); the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection in older children (haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae) were relatively underrepresented, accounting for only five of these 49 (10%) cases.

TI  == detection of bacterial antigens in milk samples from clinical cases of bovine mastitis in which culture is negative.
AB  == elisas to detect antigens against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis were developed and used on whey samples from quarter milk samples from cases of clinical mastitis in which no bacterial pathogen had been isolated by standard culture techniques. antigens against one or other of the bacteria listed above were detected in 68 per cent of 84 samples. fifty-one per cent of the 84 samples  contained antigens to e coli. antigens against one or other of these bacteria were also detected in 51 per cent of 53 quarter milk samples which were negative  on culture but had somatic cell counts of more than 500,000 cells/ml. it is suggested that elisas for the detection of antigens in quarter milk samples could be a useful adjunct to culture, to determine the infection status of a quarter.

TI  == group b streptococci invade endothelial cells: type iii capsular polysaccharide attenuates invasion.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are the most common cause of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia. the pathogenesis of gbs disease is not completely defined. gbs-induced endothelial cell injury is suggested by histological findings at autopsy and in animal studies. we hypothesized that (i) type iii gbs (coh-1) invade and injure human umbilical vein endothelial (huve) cells and (ii) isogenic mutations in gbs  capsule synthesis would influence huve invasion. confluent huve monolayers were infected for 0.5, 2, or 6 h. media with penicillin plus gentamicin were added and incubated for 2 h to kill extracellular bacteria. cells were washed and lysed, and the number of live intracellular bacteria was determined by plate counting. coh-1 invaded huve cells in a time-dependent manner at levels 1,000-fold higher than those of the noninvasive escherichia coli strain but significantly lower than those of staphylococcus aureus. there was no evidence for net intracellular  replication of gbs within huve cells. coh-1 infection of huve cells caused the release of lactate dehydrogenase activity. gbs invasion was inhibited by cytochalasin d in a dose-dependent manner; gbs-induced lactate dehydrogenase release was attenuated by cytochalasin d. the isogenic strains coh 1-11, devoid of capsular sialic acid, and coh 1-13, devoid of all type iii capsule, invaded huve cells three- to fivefold more than the parent coh-1 strain. the type iii capsular polysaccharide and particularly the capsular sialic acid attenuate gbs invasion of huve cells. electron micrographs of lung tissue from a gbs-infected newborn macaca nemestrina also showed gbs within capillary endothelial cells. we  conclude that endothelial cell invasion and injury are potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of gbs disease.

TI  == immunodiagnosis of group-a streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  == characterization of the minimal origin required for replication of the streptococcal plasmid pip501 in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == by using deletional analysis the origin of replication, orir, of the streptococcal plasmid pip501 in bacillus subtilis has been mapped at a position immediately downstream of the repr gene. determination of both the right and left border of orir allowed the definition of a sequence of a maximum of 52 nucleotides which theoretically constitutes the minimal origin of replication. recently, the start point of leading-strand synthesis of the closely related plasmid pam beta 1 has been mapped at a position which is located exactly in the  middle of this sequence (bruand et al., 1991). the function of orir did not depend on its location downstream of the repr gene. translocation of orir-containing fragments to other regions of the plasmid proved to be possible.  the smallest translocated fragment that still reconstituted autonomous replication was 72bp in size. this fragment was also active in directing the replication of an escherichia coli plasmid in b. subtilis when the repr protein was supplied in trans from a repr gene integrated into the host chromosome. the transformation efficiency of plasmids carrying translocated orir fragments showed a certain dependence on the fragment length and orientation. the dna sequence of  orir included an inverted repeat, both branches of which appeared to be essential for orir function. the repeats of orir shared sequence similarity with a repeat located upstream of promoter pii, which has been suggested to be involved in autoregulation of repr expression.

TI  == large, identical, tandem repeating units in the c protein alpha antigen gene, bca, of group b streptococci.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the united states. the surface-associated c protein alpha antigen of gbs is thought to have a role in both virulence and immunity. we previously cloned the c protein alpha antigen structural gene (named bca for group b, c protein, alpha) into escherichia coli. western blots of both the native alpha antigen and the cloned gene product demonstrate a regularly laddered pattern of heterogeneous polypeptides. the nucleotide sequence of the bca locus reveals an open reading frame of 3060 nucleotides encoding a precursor protein of 108,705 da. cleavage of a putative signal sequence of 41 amino acids yields a mature protein of 104,106 da. the 20,417-da n-terminal region of the alpha antigen shows no homology to previously described protein sequences and is followed by a series of nine tandem repeating units that make up 74% of the mature protein. each repeating unit is identical and consists of 82 amino acids with a molecular mass  of 8665 da, which is encoded by 246 nucleotides. the size of the repeating units  corresponds to the observed size differences in the heterogeneous ladder of alpha c proteins expressed by gbs. the c-terminal region of the alpha antigen contains  a membrane anchor domain motif that is shared by a number of gram-positive surface proteins. the large region of identical repeating units in bca defines protective epitopes and may play a role in generating phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the alpha antigen.

TI  == intravenous immune globulin therapy for early-onset sepsis in premature neonates.
AB  == newborn infants may have igg deficiencies that increase their susceptibility to bacterial infection. to determine whether intravenous immune globulin (ivig) therapy improves survival rates in early-onset sepsis, we prospectively entered 753 neonates (birth weight 500 to 2000 gm, gestation less than or equal to 34 weeks, age less than or equal to 12 hours) into a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial. blood culture specimens were obtained and infants randomly assigned to receive 10 ml (per kilogram) intravenously of a selected ivig (500 mg/kg) or albumin (5 mg/kg) preparation. maternal and neonatal risk factors were  not different between groups. thirty-one babies (4.2%) had early-onset sepsis; the causative organisms were group b streptococcus (12 babies), escherichia coli  (6), and others (13). of these 31 neonates, 7 (23%) died. total serum igg was higher for 7 days after ivig therapy than after albumin treatment (p less than 0.05). during these 7 days, 5 (30%) of 17 albumin-treated and none of 14 ivig-treated patients died (p less than 0.05). the survival rate at 56 days of age, however, was not significantly improved. group b streptococcus type-specific igg antibody was significantly increased after ivig treatment and appeared to be  related to the amount of ivig specific antibody. infusion-related adverse reactions were less frequent in patients receiving ivig therapy (0.5%) than in those receiving albumin. the ivig therapy in neonates with early-onset sepsis, while reducing the early mortality rate, did not significantly affect the overall survival rate. further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to determine more effective therapeutic regimens.

AB  == two experiments were carried out to describe the effects of intrauterine infusion of escherichia coli endotoxin on some aspects of nonspecific uterine defense mechanisms in healthy cyclic cows (experiment 1) and in cows with induced endometritis by experimental infection with streptococcus agalactiae (experiment  2). in experiments 1 and 2, the mean log(e) total white cell counts (>95% neutrophils) in the uterine flushing fluid of the endotoxin-treated group were significantly increased (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). streptococcus agalactiae was detected by the latex agglutination test (lat) in 47% of the samples from uteri experimentally infected with this organism; 12.5% were positive on culture, and only 10% were positive on both tests. with one exception, all the samples with a positive culture were positive to the lat, but  not all samples submitted to the lat had positive culture. there was a significant (p<0.05) association between endotoxin treatment and the presence of  infection detected by the lat but not with that detected by culture (p>0.05) at 3 to 12 days post infection. similar results were found at 8 to 16 days post infection. the infection disappeared from the endotoxin-treated group but not from the non-treated group 12 days after the induction of infection. it is concluded that intrauterine e. coli endotoxin infusion might provide an alternative treatment for those cows with endometritis that is refractory to conventional antimicrobial and hormonal therapy. it is also concluded that the lat is an easier, quicker and more reliable method than bacterial culture for the detection of endometritis caused by strep. agalactiae , and, possibly, such immunodiagnostic tests may be useful for the detection of other uterine infections.

TI  == heterologous gene expression in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and other gastrointestinal tract bacteroides are unusual gram-negative eubacteria in that genes from other gram-negative eubacteria are not expressed when introduced into these organisms. to analyze gene expression in bacteroides, expression vector and promoter probe (detection) vector systems were developed. the essential feature of the expression vector was the incorporation of a bacteroides insertion sequence element, is4351, which possesses promoter activity directed outward from its ends. genes inserted into the multiple cloning site downstream from an is4351 dna fragment were readily expressed in b. fragilis. the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) structural gene from tn9 was tested and conferred chloramphenicol resistance on b. fragilis. both chloramphenicol resistance and cat activity were shown to be dependent on the is4351 promoters. similar results were obtained with the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene (uida) but activity was just 30% of the levels seen with  cat. two tetracycline resistance determinants, tetm from streptococcus agalactiae and tetc from e. coli, also were examined. tetc did not result in detectable tetracycline resistance but the gram-positive tetm gene conferred high-level resistance to tetracycline and minocycline in bacteroides hosts. based on the cat results, promoter probe vectors containing the promoterless cat gene were constructed. these vectors were used to clone random b. fragilis promoters from partial genomic libraries and the recombinants displayed a range of cat activities and chloramphenicol mics in b. fragilis hosts. in addition, known e. coli promoters (ptet, ptac, ptrc, psyn, and p1p2rrnb) were tested for activity in b. fragilis. no chloramphenicol resistance or cat activity was observed in b. fragilis with these promoters.

TI  == the changing spectrum of neonatal meningitis over a fifteen-year period.
AB  == one hundred seventy-seven cases of neonatal meningitis treated at the university  of texas medical branch at galveston over a 15-year period (1974-1988) were reviewed. over this period, the incidence of bacterial meningitis decreased, the  incidence of aseptic meningitis remained stable, and the diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis increased in frequency. during 1984-1988, enterovirus was the most common cause of meningitis in neonates older than seven days and accounted for one third of all cases of neonatal meningitis. half of all neonates with bacterial meningitis had negative blood cultures. we recommend that 1) diagnostic lumbar puncture remain part of the routine assessment of the neonate with suspected sepsis, and 2) csf be cultured for enterovirus as well as for bacteria  when a neonate older than seven days presents with suspected sepsis.

AB  == explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue taken from virgin heifers were used to  examine adherence, colonization and cytopathogenesis of streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in the putative target tissue. none of the five bacteria was able to adhere to healthy ductular epithelium but all showed a marked tropism for exposed connective tissue. s. aureus and e. coli induced a marked cytopathic effect in ductular epithelium after 6 hours in culture but the bacteria were not  in close association with the affected tissue. no evidence could be found to support the hypothesis that adherence to epithelium might be the first stage in the pathogenesis of mastitis caused by these organisms.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  == flomoxef sodium (fmox) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a  bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6  micrograms/ml) and n.d. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. the urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. fmox was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected,  and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. in 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. the bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of escherichia coli,  and 2 strains of haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". moreover, the drug, administered with  or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. no side effects were observed in any of the patients. concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in got were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. the results suggest that fmox is useful and safe also in neonates.

TI  == direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a dna probe.
AB  == this study involved the rapid, direct identification of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus  sp., and streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (bactec, johnston laboratories, inc.) by using the accuprobe (gen-probe, san diego, calif.) culture confirmation test. this method uses a chemiluminescent dna probe  that detects the rrna of the target organisms. the manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. the first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml)  from the blood culture bottle. the second method used a microcentrifuge and less  volume (1 to 1.5 ml). a total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by accuprobe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. the microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. when combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the accuprobe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.

TI  == effect of milking without pulsation on teat duct colonization with streptococcus  agalactiae and penetrability to endotoxin.
AB  == forty quarters of 10 cows were milked for a 9-d period with one of four treatments: 1) no liner pulsation, 2) conventional milking, 3) no pulsation for 4 d followed by conventional milking for 5 d, and 4) conventional milking for 4 d followed by milking without pulsation for 5 d. all teat orifices were inoculated  with approximately .5 million cfu of streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae on d 1 and 5. recoveries of strep. agalactiae from the teat end were increased for teats milked without pulsation. recoveries of strep. dysgalactiae were lower than those of strep. agalactiae and not increased by milking without pulsation. in a second experiment, teats of 20 cows were milked for a 15-d period with or without liner pulsation. for 10 successive milkings, all teats were inoculated with 1.0 micrograms of escherichia coli endotoxin either immediately or 2.5 h after each milking. the frequency of endotoxin penetration, measured by  the wisconsin mastitis test, in pulsated quarters and in nonpulsated quarters was similar. for quarters milked without pulsation but not for pulsated quarters, inoculation of endotoxin immediately after milking led to greater incidence of teat duct penetration than for inoculation 2.5 h after milking.

TI  == bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  == during delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the  ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells  of respiratory nasal mucosa. bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. in mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. results of the study performed by usual methods revealed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection  of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.

TI  == early response in septicemia in newborns and their mothers. effect of escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and tumor necrosis factor on lactoferrin release and the generation of tissue thromboplastin.
AB  == using a whole blood in vitro model, we have investigated the effect of escherichia coli (e. coli), streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci, gbs)  and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf) on the generation of lactoferrin (lf), interleukin-1 beta (il-1) and tissue thromboplastin (tpl) in healthy newborns at  term and their mothers. e. coli (at a final concentration of 10(7)/ml) significantly increased the release of lf in whole blood from newborns after 20 as well as 60 min stimulation, and in samples from their mothers after 60 min stimulation. a significant increase in the release of lf was observed in both newborns and their mothers after 20 and 60 min stimulation with tnf (at a final concentration of 1000 pg/ml). a combination of tnf/e. coli or tnf/gbs never gave  any significant additional stimulatory effect. after stimulation with e. coli or  gbs (both at a final concentration of 10(7)/ml) for 60 min a significant increase in production of tnf and tpl was observed in newborns. in newborns a significant  increase in production of tnf and tpl was observed also after 20 min stimulation  with e. coli. tnf (at a final concentration of 1000 pg/ml) significantly increased the generation of tpl after 20 and 60 min stimulation in both groups. there was a tendency for a greater release of lf and generation of tnf and tpl in samples from newborns compared with their mothers, but the differences were not statistically significant. e. coli, gbs and tnf had no significant effect on the  production of il-1.

AB  == cefpirome (hr 810, cpr), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. plasma and urinary levels of cpr were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. the results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with cpr were investigated. cerebrospinal  fluid levels in a case of neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at  1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of  49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. these results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. these levels appear to be higher than mic90 values against escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. cpr was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute uti, totalling 61 cases. clinical efficacies were excellent in 38 cases, good in 22 cases and fair in 1 case with an efficacy rete of 98.4% (excellent + good).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == molecular characterization of an iga receptor from group b streptococci: sequence of the gene, identification of a proline-rich region with unique structure and isolation of n-terminal fragments with iga-binding capacity.
AB  == certain strains of group b streptococci express a cell surface protein that binds iga and acts as a virulence factor. this iga receptor is referred to here as protein bac. the gene for protein bac was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the complete nucleotide sequence was determined. the deduced amino acid sequence of 1134 residues includes a signal sequence of 37 amino acids and a putative membrane anchor region at the c-terminal end. the processed form of the  receptor, 1097 residues, has a calculated molecular weight of 123,786. there are  no cysteines in protein bac, suggesting a fibrillar structure. the c-terminal half of the protein includes a 90 residues long region with a novel type of periodic structure, the "xpz motif", in which every third amino acid is proline.  unlike other bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins, there are no long repeats in protein bac. clones which express only part of the protein bac gene were used  to show that iga-binding takes place in the n-terminal part of the molecule. protein bac was originally described as an antigen called beta, but n-terminal fragments that bind iga do not react with a reference serum against the beta antigen. these and other data indicate that protein bac can be divided into two regions with different functions: an n-terminal iga-binding region and a c-terminal region corresponding to the beta antigen. the iga-binding region of protein bac does not show any homology to protein arp, the iga receptor from group a streptococci, although these receptors have similar binding properties. this indicates that convergent evolution has favored the appearance of these two  structurally different streptococcal iga receptors.

TI  == cloned alpha and beta c-protein antigens of group b streptococci elicit protective immunity.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci [gbs]) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the united states. the surface-associated c proteins of gbs play a role in immunity, but their number, size, structure, function, and virulence properties have not been well characterized. a recombinant library of dna fragments from gbs strain a909 (type ia/c) was prepared in the plasmid pux12, a specially constructed escherichia coli expression vector. the library was screened with a rabbit antiserum shown to be protective for passive immunity to gbs infection in a mouse lethality model. clones were divided into two distinct groups on the basis of dna-dna cross-hybridization, restriction enzyme analysis, and the expression of antigenic proteins in e. coli. a characteristic clone from each group was chosen for further study. clone pjms23 expresses gene products that biochemically and immunologically correspond to the trypsin-resistant, c-protein alpha antigen. clone pjms1 expresses a gene product that binds to immunoglobulin a and is similar to the trypsin-sensitive, c-protein beta antigen. antisera raised in rabbits against e. coli containing each of the plasmid clones were able to elicit protective immunity in mice challenged by gbs strains carrying the c proteins but not by non-c-protein-bearing strains. southern blot analysis shows no dna homology between the clones, and there is no immunological cross-reactivity between the antigens they express. therefore, pjms23 and pjms1 encode two different c proteins that define unique protective epitopes.

(28 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (14 cases), streptococcus agalactiae (13 cases), and escherichia coli (12 cases). haemophilus sp. was dominant in patients over 3 months of age, and s. pneumoniae was noted in all age groups. the latter 2 were dominant under 3 months of age. 3. the outcome  of 125 cases was as follows: cured, 73 cases (58.4%); improved, 26 cases (20.8%); dead, 15 cases (12.0%); unknown, 11 cases (8.8%). as to the outcome by age, the mortality of infants within 1 month old was the highest, 29.0%, and then decreased with increasing age. as to the outcome by causative organisms, haemophilus sp. and e. coli were associated with good outcome, whereas s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae with poor outcome. 4. among several antibiotics, ampicillin was the most frequently used in 94 cases, followed by cefotaxime in 50 cases. 5. as to the initial antibiotic treatment, 51 cases were treated with penicillins (pcs) (including pcs + aminoglycosides (ags], 9 cases with cephalosporins group i, ii, iv, (ceps i, ii, iv) (including ceps i, ii, iv + ags), 25 cases with ceps v (including ceps v + ags) and 31 cases with ceps v + pcs (including ceps v + pcs + ags). no significant differences were observed in the outcome among these initial treatment group. 6. compared with the initial treatments of ceps v or ceps v + pcs groups, other antibiotics were used more frequently in those of pcs + ags and ceps i, ii, iv groups. in the light of this  analysis, the initial treatments of purulent meningitis with pcs + ags or ceps i, ii, iv were not so effective as those with ceps v or ceps v + pcs.

TI  == early response in neonatal septicemia. the effect of escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and tumor necrosis factor on the generation of lactoferrin.
AB  == using an in vitro model, we report the early effect of escherichia coli (e. coli), streptococcus agalactiea (group b streptococci, gbs) and recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf) on the release of lactoferrin (lf) and the generation of interleukin-1 (il-1) due to e. coli, using heparinized whole blood from healthy full-term newborns. we wanted to find a dose response relationship between lactoferrin generation on the one hand and the amount of e. coli, gbs and tnf on the other hand. in a final concentration of 10(7) per ml both bacteria increased the release of lf significantly. the response to e. coli was immediate  and mg/l +/- 0.29 mg/l, e. coli 1.83 mg/l +/- 0.76 mg/l, p less than 0.001). gbs  was a less potent stimulant than e. coli and the response was only apparent after 20 minutes (mean +/- s.d.: 1.06 mg/l +/- 0.49 mg/l, p less than 0.01). tnf in a concentration of 10000 pg/ml as well as 1000 pg/ml increased the release of lf significantly (after 20 minutes mean +/- s.d.: 1.09 mg/l +/- 0.42 mg/l and 0.97 mg/l +/- 0.36 mg/l, respectively), whereas a concentration of 100 pg/ml had no effect. whole blood incubated with different preparations of lf for 20 minutes did not increase the generation of lf significantly. no significant changes in il-1 levels were observed. lactoferrin had bacteriostatic but no bactericidal effect on gbs and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == immunoglobulin therapy for neonatal sepsis: an overview of animal and clinical studies.
AB  == bacteria such as escherichia coli and group b streptococci are common neonatal pathogens. neonates infected perinatally often develop overwhelming sepsis which  may rapidly progress to shock and death in just a few hours. this fulminant course suggests that immunity to these bacteria is deficient. studies from several laboratories have shown that antibody is important in immunity to group b streptococcus. in vitro studies have demonstrated that efficient phagocytosis and killing of these bacteria by neutrophils or monocytes requires opsonic antibody.  many premature babies have decreased amounts of total serum immunoglobulin g and  term babies may not have sufficient levels of group b streptococcal antibodies to be protected. immune globulin that contains adequate opsonic antibody to group b  streptococcus may therefore be of value as adjunctive therapy for treating infections with these bacteria and may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with group b streptococcal infection in high-risk neonates. although intravenous immune globulin has been used to both prevent and treat infections in neonates, only limited efficacy data are available. several large, blinded, and controlled studies that are being completed and analyzed will be important to determine the role of immune globulin therapy in neonates.

TI  == [detection of causative bacteria for bovine mastitis and their susceptibility to  beta-lactam antibacterial agents].
AB  == during the period from november 1988 to may 1989, causative bacteria in a total of 172 clinical mastitis cases observed in 66 farms in 5 districts with 6 areas in japan were examined and frequencies of their occurrences were determined. susceptibilities (in mics) of the isolates to 6 beta-lactam antibacterial agents  were also determined. as a result, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) was identified in 94 out of 172 cases (54.7%) and were the most prevalent. corynebacterium spp., gram-negative bacteria and staphylococcus aureus were found in 52 (30.2%), 49 (28.5%) and 43 (25.0%) cases, respectively. four species of streptococcus family (s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis and s. bovis) were identified in a total of 58 cases (33.7%). susceptibility testing of cns to  cefoperazone (cpz), cefazolin (cez), benzylpenicillin (pcg), ampicillin (abpc), methicillin (dmppc) and cloxacillin (mcipc) showed that all mic80's (inhibiting bacterial growth of 80% of all isolates) were within a range from 0.10 to 3.13 micrograms/ml and that there was no marked differences in antibacterial effects among the antibiotics used. the highest antibacterial effect on s. aureus was exhibited by mcipc, which inhibited the growth of all isolates at 0.39 microgram/ml. the mics of dmppc against all isolates of s. aureus were 3.13 micrograms/ml or less and no methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was detected. there was no difference in antibacterial activities against streptococcus family  between penicillin antibiotics (dmppc, mcipc, abpc and pcg) and cephem antibiotics (cpz and cez), both of which showed excellent antibacterial activities. cephem antibiotics exhibited higher activities against gram-negative  bacteria than penicillin antibiotics. especially cpz, the third generation cephem, showed excellent antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., as well as against other enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == plus-origin mapping of single-stranded dna plasmid pe194 and nick site homologies with other plasmids.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194 manifests a natural thermosensitivity for replication and can be established in several species, both gram positive and gram negative, thus making it attractive for use as a delivery vector. like most  characterized plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pe194 generates single-stranded dna. the direction of pe194 replication is clockwise, as determined by the strandedness of free single-stranded dna. significant homology exists between a 50-base-pair sequence in the origin of pe194 and sequences present in plasmids pmv158 (streptococcus agalactiae), padb201 (mycoplasma mycoides), and psh71 (lactococcus lactis). we used an initiation-termination reaction, in which pe194  initiates replication at its own origin and is induced to terminate at the related pmv158 sequence, to demonstrate that pe194 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism; the initiation nick site was localized to an 8-base-pair sequence.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

AB  == during investigation of possible phospholipase a2 (pla2) production by pathogenic bacteria associated with preterm labour, a rapid and simple assay method was developed which involved few steps and which could be applied easily to large numbers of samples. the principle difference from previously described methods lies in separation of the reaction products by partitioning them between organic  and aqueous solvents, rather than by using thin layer chromatography. this enabled us to determine that none of the bacteria studied released pla2 into the  culture medium spontaneously, and that only escherichia coli contained high levels of pla2.

AB  == cefepime (bmy 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. mice  were infected intracranially with streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and s. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with s. agalactiae. cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and e. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa meningitis. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. against h. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the least active compound. the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.

TI  == sensorineural hearing loss in children recovered from purulent meningitis: a study in thai children at ramathibodi hospital.
AB  == hearing loss is one of the serious complications of bacterial meningitis. conventional audiometry and auditory brainstem response (abr) methods were used to detect this complication in eighteen children who recovered from bacterial meningitis treated at ramathibodi hospital from january 1983 to december 1987. six patients (33%) were found to have persistent bilateral sensorineural hearing  loss. among them, the causes of meningitis were: hemophilus influenzae (3 patients), streptococcus pneumoniae (1 patient), streptococcus agalactiae (1 patient) and escherichia coli (1 patient). various clinical and demographic factors were examined in relation to the hearing loss, but no significant correlation was observed. since meningitis often affects small children and makes conventional audiometry tests difficult, abr was found to be a more effective method for testing this group of patients.

TI  == neonatal susceptibility and immunity to major bacterial pathogens.
AB  == neonatal bacterial sepsis has continued in this decade to contribute significantly to neonatal mortality and morbidity and is a critical determinant of outcome in infants of very low birth weight despite the availability of antibiotics. the group b streptococcus and escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens for the newborn infant. studies on the epidemiology, microbiology, and  immunology of group b streptococcal disease are more extensive than those on e. coli disease. type-specific antibodies, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and complement are integral to immunity against group b streptococcus, and experimental data are presented to support the importance of these components. the newborn infant is handicapped by temporary deficiencies in host defenses, and approaches for restoring immunocompetence, such as immunization of the mother or  passive administration of intravenous immunoglobulins or other immune factors, are presented for consideration. further studies are required to demonstrate the  safety, feasibility, and efficacy of these approaches.

TI  == control of fetal membrane prostaglandin e2 production by bacteria.
AB  == the effect of bacteria on the production of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) and pge2 metabolites by fetal membranes has been investigated. live bacteria stimulated a  large increase in the levels of pge2 metabolites, but only a small increase in the levels of pge2 on the fetal side of the membranes. no significant changes in  the levels of pge2 or its metabolites were found on the maternal side. bacteria may therefore stimulate pge2 production by fetal membranes during short-term incubations, but it seems that the metabolic capacity of the chorion was so high  that no change in pge2 levels was detectable on the maternal side of the fetal membranes. this was confirmed by the finding that less than 1% of 3h-pge2 added to the fetal side of the membrane reached the maternal side without being metabolized.

AB  == all cases of bacterial meningitis in the neonatal unit at king edward viii hospital, durban for the period 1 january 1981 to 31 december 1987 were reviewed. in particular, we looked at the impact of cefotaxime on mortality rates and amikacin on the incidence of hospital-acquired gram-negative bacillary (gnb) meningitis. klebsiella was found to be the commonest cause of neonatal meningitis, followed by escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. eighty-four per cent of all cases of gnb meningitis presented more than 3 days after birth, with the vast majority being caused by gentamicin-resistant klebsiella. a decline in the incidence of meningitis from 1.27/1000 live births in 1981 and 0.95/1000 for the period 1981-1986 to 0.22/1000 live births in 1987,  with no cases of klebsiella meningitis being seen in that year, coincided with the exclusive use of amikacin as the parenteral aminoglycoside in place of gentamicin in the unit after august 1986. the initial decline in the incidence of meningitis from 0.93/1000 in 1985 to 0.46/1000 in 1986 was attributed to the introduction in 1985 of strict hand disinfection measures to prevent cross-infection in the unit. the case mortality rate (cmr) fell from 0.65 for the period 1981-1984 to 0.42 for the period 1985-1987, and we believe this was largely a result of the introduction of cefotaxime in 1984 as first-line therapy  for gnb meningitis, together with better patient care facilities.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == this article describes the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolysin gene from a serotype 1 strain of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. the hemolysin was a  thermolabile protein with an apparent molecular weight of 29,500 (29.5k hemolysin). unlike expression of the recently described 105k hemolysin of a. pleuropneumoniae (j. frey and j. nicolet, fems microbiol. lett. 55:41-46, 1988),  expression of this hemolysin was not regulated by ca2+. antiserum prepared against the 105k hemolysin did not neutralize the activity of the 29.5k hemolysin; conversely, antiserum prepared against the 29.5k hemolysin did not neutralize the activity of the 105k hemolysin. the hemolytic activity was not neutralized with antisera against hemolytic escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, or purified streptolysin o, but antisera prepared against recombinants containing the 29.5k gene and convalescent pig sera abrogated hemolytic activity. although hemolytic activity could be detected in several strains of e. coli k-12 and in minicells expressing several different constructs  encoding the 29.5k hemolysin, we could not rigorously exclude the possibility that the gene which we have isolated encodes a regulator of hemolytic activity rather than a hemolysin per se.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

AB  == in our nursery, we identified neonates with positive urine latex particle agglutination (lpa) tests for group b streptococcus (gbs) antigen who did not have corroborating cultural evidence of infection. to investigate the mechanisms  underlying these apparent false-positive reactions, we examined the urine lpa test in an unselected population of neonates suspected of sepsis. urine specimens for lpa testing and culture and simultaneous perirectal cultures were obtained from 134 neonates with suspected sepsis. six infants had positive blood cultures  for gbs; four of the six were positive by lpa testing. an additional 20 infants had positive lpa tests but negative blood cultures; of these, 13 had mothers who  received antibiotic treatment prior to delivery. two infants with positive lpa results and negative blood cultures had bacteria isolated from urine cultures obtained in a nonsterile fashion (gbs, escherichia coli). gbs was not isolated from perirectal swabs of infants with positive lpa tests and negative blood cultures. in conclusion, (i) a high proportion of neonates evaluated for sepsis gave positive lpa tests and negative blood cultures, (ii) local contamination of  the perirectal skin or urinary tract with gbs was an unlikely source of false-positive lpa reactions, and (iii) maternal antibiotic pretreatment during labor may represent an important cause of apparent false-positive lpa reactions.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == molecular analysis of a region of the group b streptococcus chromosome involved in type iii capsule expression.
AB  == type iii group b streptococci (gbs) are the most common cause of neonatal sepsis  and meningitis in the united states. the important role of the type iii polysaccharide capsule and of the terminal sialic acid moiety of the capsule in the virulence of gbs has been demonstrated by using tn916 mutagenesis. several of the transposon insertion sites that resulted in defective type iii capsule synthesis were located in a 30-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome. hybridization analysis of two other type iii strains that differed in their relative virulence and of gbs serotypes ia, ib, ic, and ii showed that this region of the chromosome was highly conserved. a repetitive 1.4-kb sequence was found only in the 30-kb region of the more virulent type iii strain, coh 1. the escherichia coli maxicell in vivo expression system and an in vitro coupled transcription-translation system successfully identified the proteins expressed from the 30-kb region. comparison of the proteins expressed from the same dna fragments in these two assays indicated that some of these proteins may contain leader sequences that would ultimately result in their secretion to the cell surface. identification and further characterization of the genes and their products will provide the foundation for understanding the genetic and biochemical events in gbs capsular polysaccharide production.

TI  == is861, a group b streptococcal insertion sequence related to is150 and is3 of escherichia coli.
AB  == a 1,442-base-pair (bp) insertion sequence (is861) was identified in the type iii  group b streptococcal (gbs) strain coh-1. it is flanked by 26-bp imperfect inverted repeats and contains two open reading frames, 1 and 2, encoding 141- and 277-amino-acid proteins, respectively. a 3-bp target sequence, aca, is duplicated and flanks each inverted repeat. is861 shares greater than 30% homology with is3  and is150 of escherichia coli, primarily in the region of their putative transposases. northern (rna) analysis revealed that rna is actively transcribed in vivo by is861 and 17- and 36-kilodalton proteins were synthesized in e. coli maxicell assays. multiple copies of is861 were observed throughout the chromosome of coh-1, and one of the copies is located near genes involved in gbs capsule synthesis. is861 is the first insertion sequence identified in gbs. its role in gbs and the significance of its relationship to the phylogenetically similar insertion sequences typified by is150 and is3 of e. coli are unknown.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. antibacterial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, and escherichia coli  were compared with those of ampicillin (abpc). sbtpc was superior to abpc especially against beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae, e. coli, s. aureus, and b. catarrhalis. 2. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (sbt) and abpc after administration of sbtpc fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. mean half-lives of sbt and abpc in  the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. mean urinary recovery rates of sbt and abpc in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. sbtpc  fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). the overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%.  4. no adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. no abnormal laboratory test values were observed. these results indicate the usefulness of sbtpc fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == computed tomography in bacterial meningitis of childhood.
AB  == the hospital records of 85 children with bacterial meningitis were reviewed and a subset of 25 children who underwent computed tomography of the head were identified. the major stated indications for computed tomography were fever (8 patients), seizures (4 patients), signs of increased intracranial pressure (4 patients), focal neurologic dysfunction (3 patients) and recurrent meningitis (2  patients). abnormal findings were demonstrated by computed tomography in 20 of 25 patients but in 8 patients consisted solely of nonspecific dilatation of spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid or of basilar enhancement. the yield of information that was useful either diagnostically or therapeutically was low; positive findings of obvious clinical relevance were present in only 2 cases. computed tomography provides an accurate means of diagnosing intracranial complications of bacterial meningitis. it must be used conservatively, however, to limit expense and radiation exposure and enhance the yield of potentially relevant information. computed tomography is indicated for children with persistent neurologic dysfunction, persistently positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures or recurrent meningitis, whereas it is of little value for children with prolonged fever alone.

TI  == group b streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  == infection with group b streptococci (gbs) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. in the present studies, we have examined the effects of group b streptococci on c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. fresh human serum  was activated to form c5a and c5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. the activated serum was then incubated with group b organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. group b organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in c-dependent chemotactic activity. the degree of inhibition was profound with 1 x 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). experiments indicated that significant chemotactic  factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to gbs organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. a number of different strains of gbs of types i, ii, and iii possessed inhibitory activity. in contrast, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. group a streptococci that were m protein positive also inactivated c-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. the inhibitory activity of the gbs strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. c5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by ria were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain  suggesting that absorption was not involved. sds-page analysis revealed that group b streptococci degrade the c5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 da. thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of gbs infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate c-derived inflammatory mediators. the gbs c5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group b streptococcal infection.

TI  == effects of fibronectin on the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with unopsonized and antibody-opsonized bacteria.
AB  == fibronectin (fn) affects the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls)  with certain bacteria. fn alone enhanced the response, in a chemiluminescence (cl) assay, of pmnls to staphylococcus aureus (p less than .05) and staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .01) but had no effect on type iii, group b streptococci (gbs) or escherichia coli. when gbs or e. coli were first preopsonized in antibody, fn significantly enhanced the cl response of pmnls (p less than .05). the intracellular metabolic inhibitor nan3 but not the extracellular scavengers superoxide dismutase or human serum albumin inhibited fn-enhanced cl; this fact suggests that enhancement of the respiratory burst by fn is an intracellular event. we used an acridine orange-crystal violet monolayer assay to examine the effects of fn on ingestion and intracellular killing of bacteria by pmnls. fn alone promoted uptake and killing of s. aureus (p less than .01) and s. epidermidis (p less than .05) by pmnls but did not enhance monolayer  phagocytosis of gbs or e. coli, unless these bacteria were preopsonized in antibody (p less than .01).

TI  == identification and cloning of a plasmid-encoded erythromycin resistance determinant from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == plasmid analysis, plasmid curing, cloning, and hybridization experiments were used to study four lactobacillus reuteri strains showing high resistance to erythromycin. plasmid curing with acriflavine resulted in a loss of erythromycin  resistance in a frequency of 1-10%. for three of the strains this was accompanied by a loss of a 6.9-mda plasmid, which was shown to be identical for the different strains and designated plul631. the erythromycin (erm) gene was located on a 5.5-mda plasmid in the fourth strain. a restriction map of plul631 was constructed and the location of the erm gene on the plasmid was identified by cloning in escherichia coli. by using a streptococcus lactis-e. coli shuttle vector, the erm gene was also transformed to s. lactis and expressed. the erm gene from l. reuteri was shown to be related to the erm gene from pip501 (streptococcus agalactiae) by dna-dna hybridization.

TI  == phagocytic and postphagocytic activities of bovine neutrophils for pure and mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  == a comparative study of phagocytosis and postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of bovine blood neutrophils incubated with pure and mixed cultures of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae was preformed. most neutrophils when incubated with mixed cultures showed preferential phagocytosis for one species and a smaller number phagocytized both  species of microorganisms. percent phagocytosis for e. coli in pure culture was similar to that of strep. agalactiae in pure culture and higher than that for staph. aureus in pure culture. neutrophils incubated with mixed cultures of e. coli and staph. aureus or e. coli and strep. agalactiae showed greater than expected phagocytosis of each microorganisms alone and reduced phagocytosis of both microorganisms together. postphagocytic oxidative metabolic activity of neutrophils, measured by percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, did not differ  following phagocytosis of these three microorganisms in pure cultures. in comparison, a synergistic effect on nitroblue tetrazolium reductive activity was  seen in mixed cultures as evidenced by higher percent nitroblue tetrazolium reduction following phagocytosis of both e. coli and staph. aureus or e. coli and strep. agalactiae. these observations indicate that the phagocytic and metabolic  activities of neutrophils for bacteria in mixed cultures may not be identical to  those in pure cultures.

TI  == cloning and expression of the camp factor of group b streptococci in escherichia  coli.
AB  == the genetic determinant of the camp factor from a strain of group b streptococcus (gbs; streptococcus agalactiae) was cloned in escherichia coli. total cell dna from the gbs strain r268 was used to construct a gene bank with bacteriophage lambda embl4 in the e. coli k-12 strain le392. recombinant phage plaques were detected by immunoblots by using a specific antiserum raised against purified camp factor. two hybrid phages showing expression of camp factor were identified. subcloning the camp gene (cfb) into the high-copy-number vector puc8 resulted in  highly unstable plasmids. therefore, subcloning was performed with the low-copy-number vector plg339 resulting in the stable recombinant plasmids pco61  and pco62 which lead to expression of camp protein first identified by colony immunoblotting. western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a similar camp protein pattern in lambda embl4 recombinant phage lysates (molecular weight, 22,000 to 24,000) as compared to that obtained from a gbs culture supernatant (molecular weight, 22,000 to 26,000) but a different camp protein pattern (molecular weight, 20,000 to 23,000) from lysates of e. coli carrying pco61 or pco62. to study the excretion of the camp protein we performed a semi-quantitative dot blot analysis of proteins recovered from cell fractions and supernatants of the e. coli recombinant clones. in contrast to gbs r268, where the camp factor is readily excreted, the camp protein is not excreted in e. coli  clones containing pco61 and pco62 but is found associated with the cell fractions.

AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on the use of ceftriaxone  in the perinatal period].
AB  == laboratory studies and clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone (ctrx) were carried out with mothers and infants in perinatal period. the presence of synergistic effect  between ctrx and amniotic fluid were studied using a broth dilution method. stronger effects were recognized when both agents were present together compared  to each agent alone by the fact that values of mic and mbc became closer together for escherichia coli as well as for streptococcus agalactiae. against the growth  of e. coli, a synergism was observed, but for s. agalactiae, only an additive effect was found. the placental transmission of ctrx upon the administration was  rapid, and the blood ctrx level reached its peak shortly after the intravenous administration of the drug. the transport of the drug into the fetus through placenta was excellent and one dose of 1 g of ctrx gave drug concentrations in the umbilical cord serum and amniotic fluid higher than mic's against main pathogenic organisms. according to these results, it should be possible to treat  or prevent perinatal infections by a dose of one gram per day of ctrx, once or twice daily. cases of perinatal infections were treated with ctrx. an effective treatment without side effects was obtained. no physical abnormalities nor unusual laboratory test results were recognized in neonates delivered from mothers who received ctrx administration. the penetration of ctrx into mothers' milk was low, thus the drug transfer into neonates through the breast-feeding should not be a problem. it appears, from the above study, that ctrx is a clinically useful antibiotic for the prophylaxis and the treatment of perinatal infections.

AB  == several authors have described the bacterial growth-altering properties of amniotic fluid. we examined group b streptococcus growth in aseptically obtained  amniotic fluid in vitro after altering its zinc, phosphorus, and meconium contents. zinc and phosphorus levels were calculated in amniotic fluid and in meconium. separate solutions of zinc and phosphorus were added to yield concentrations of 0.7, 7.0, 70, and 700 mumol. the solutions were incubated with  group b streptococcus iii 893 and escherichia coli c5 strains, and 24-hour growth curves were plotted. meconium, 0.5 mg/ml, was added to each amniotic fluid + zinc and amniotic fluid + phosphorus solution, and growth curves were plotted. the rate of proliferation of group b streptococcus varied directly with the zinc concentration (700 = 70 greater than 7 greater than 0.7 mumol) and inversely with the phosphorus content (700 less than 70 less than 7 = 0.7 mumol). meconium enhanced the proliferative effect of zinc and hindered the inhibitory effect of phosphorus. thus one possible mechanism whereby meconium enhances bacterial growth in amniotic fluid may be by alteration of zinc-to-phosphorus ratios.

AB  == flomoxef (fmox; 6315-s), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. the activity of fmox against staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and mic was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. this mic value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. the distribution of mic's of fmox against escherichia coli and salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. serum concentrations of fmox after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours  after administration, respectively, and t1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg fmox were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, t1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. fmox was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. in these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. all bacterial species identified including branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with fmox. 4. only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated got and gpt, and 1 case of elevated gpt were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.

TI  == effect of bacterial growth on the bursting pressure of fetal membranes in vitro.
AB  == by mounting a layer of chorioamniotic membrane on a specially designed reaction vessel, we studied the effect of escherichia coli and/or group b streptococcus growing on the decidual surface of the membranes in tissue culture or bacteriologic medium. the organisms grew equally well in either medium. when growing in tissue culture medium, either organism significantly weakened the membranes as compared with controls (membranes incubated in the absence of either organism). membranes derived from pregnancies delivered vaginally or abdominally  responded similarly. when organisms were grown in bacteriologic medium, bursting  pressures did not decrease. addition of bacteriologic medium (20-60%) to tissue culture medium did not affect bacterial growth, but inhibited significantly the lowering of bursting pressures. bacteriologic medium also inhibited the peroxidase-h2o2-halide system in vitro. heat-killed bacteria and/or supernatants  of culture medium previously inoculated with bacteria were not effective in weakening membranes. the results suggest that live bacteria in conjunction with active membrane metabolism lead to a weakening and eventual rupture of the membranes.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the ibc protein genes of group b streptococci: binding of human immunoglobulin a to the beta antigen.
AB  == total-cell dna isolated from a highly virulent serotype ic strain of a group b streptococcus was used to construct a gene bank with bacteriophage lambda l47.1 in escherichia coli k-12. recombinant phage plaques in the bank were immunoblotted by using anti-alpha- and anti-beta-specific antibodies directed towards the ibc proteins purified from the streptococcal cell surface, and hybrid phages expressing the alpha protein (lambda alpha +) and the beta protein (lambda beta +) were identified. dna inserts in these phages were subcloned into e. coli  high-copy-number plasmid vectors to produce stable alpha + (pphc10) and beta + (pphc8 and pphc33) recombinant plasmids, and restriction maps of the cloned streptococcal sequences were constructed. antibodies against the two streptococcus-derived proteins reacted with high-molecular-weight polypeptides made in e. coli cells carrying the corresponding hybrid plasmids and with several degradation peptides from them. a 190-kilodalton alpha protein, previously undetected, was identified; this species may be the native alpha protein or a precursor of it. in addition, mutagenesis of the cloned sequences was carried out by using the omega fragment to determine the direction of transcription. in e. coli, the beta protein, but not the alpha protein, bound human immunoglobulin a (iga) in western blots, and neither protein bound igg or igm.

TI  == a two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  == there are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. the hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report  a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. about 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. the most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. the most  common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.

AB  == a study of the bacterial flora of the genitalia of nulliparous savanna brown does was carried out both before breeding and at different intervals postpartum to investigate the type of microbial organisms that could be present in the uterus,  cervix and the vagina respectively. of 29 pre-breeding vaginal swabs, staphylococcus sp. was isolated from 20 goats, streptococcus sp. from 15 goats and micrococcus sp. from four goats. mycoplasma agalactiae was isolated from five goats. the postpartum vagina did not show any appreciable change in the microbial flora, except that escherichia coli was encountered in two cases. the uterus yielded e. coli from the goats slaughtered 2 days postpartum; micrococcus sp. from goats slaughtered 12 days postpartum; staph. aureus from goats slaughtered 16 days postpartum and staph. aureus from goats slaughtered 24 days postpartum. also in these two cases-a goat slaughtered at two days postpartum (dpp) and a goat slaughtered 16 dpp-e. coli was present in the uterus. other isolates from the uteri of slaughtered goats were micrococcus sp. (12 dpp), staph. aureus and micrococcus sp. (16 dpp) and staph. aureus (24 dpp).

TI  == proliferation of group b streptococci in human amniotic fluid in vitro.
AB  == the group b streptococcus is one of the most virulent organisms causing perinatal infection. human amniotic fluid from the second and third trimesters was pooled and analyzed for electrolytes, protein, albumin, zinc, inorganic phosphorus, ferritin, lysozyme, and immunoglobulins. we inoculated replicates of specimens with known virulent strains of group b streptococci (893, 891, and 878) and escherichia coli (c5) with todd-hewitt broth and normal saline solution used as controls. group b streptococci strains 893 and 891 proliferated rapidly at rates  similar to their rates in todd-hewitt broth. strain 878 grew at a rate slower than that of strains 893 and 891. the amniotic fluid specimens were similar with  respect to factors reported as inhibitory to bacterial proliferation. second- and third-trimester amniotic fluid supports the growth of group b streptococci as well as a culture medium optimized for bacterial growth. strain-specific variance in group b streptococci growth rates in amniotic fluid may have clinical significance for those at risk for group b streptococci infection.

TI  == the effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  == amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of e. coli, staph. aureus and b. subtilis, while ps. aeruginosa, str. faecalis and str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. but when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. the levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. antibacterial activity against e. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. when lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on b. subtilis was restored. the growth of staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

AB  == plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups a, b, and g, ten from enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the  chloramphenicol resistance gene of pip501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group b streptococcus. the 6.3-kb hindiii fragment of pip501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pbr322. a 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in dna-dna hybridization experiments. sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. the absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group b streptococcus, as well as three isolated from e. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants  in the streptococci and in the enterococci.

AB  == neonatal infections caused by gbs are commonly associated with a deficiency of igg antibody to the type-specific polysaccharide of the infecting organism. the prevalence and importance of human antibody to specific surface proteins, which are very common in clinical gbs strains, are unknown. type-specific antibody is sufficiently prevalent that immunoglobulin preparations for both intramuscular and intravenous use contain animal-protective, opsonic antibody for many gbs strains. the availability of polysaccharide vaccines suggest that even more potent, "hyperimmune" preparations can be prepared from immunized volunteers. the importance of selective antibody deficiency in k1 e. coli infections of newborns  is less clear. protective, opsonic antibody is more difficult to demonstrate in human serum, but activity has been shown in some igiv preparations. the specificity of the active antibody and the feasibility of producing hyperimmune igiv against k1 e. coli are unknown at this time.

TI  == does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? a microbiological study.
AB  == in 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. the gram-positive aerobic cocci, staph. epidermidis, strept. faecalis and strept. agalactiae as well as escherichia coli and klebsiella/enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. these microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of  these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. among the anaerobes, bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. these three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. on the other hand, strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of three phenolic compounds and four metal chelators were tested at 0, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm in vitro against four major mastitis-causing bacteria, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. overall, butylated hydroxyanisole and tert-butylhydroquinone showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. these phenolics were bactericidal at 250 to 500 ppm against all four bacteria tested. the butylated hydroxytoluene was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria  but was ineffective against the coliforms. at 250 ppm, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but much less effective against the gram-negatives. however, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was more growth inhibitory than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid against the gram-negative bacteria and especially against escherichia coli. all other compounds were generally much less effective  or ineffective against all four microorganisms. therefore, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid may have  practical implications in the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.

TI  == activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone alone and in combination with penicillin,  ampicillin and piperacillin against neonatal meningitis pathogens.
AB  == the activities of penicillin g, ampicillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone alone and in combination against 130 isolates of escherichia coli, group b streptococci and listeria monocytogenes from neonatal meningitis were assessed by using agar dilution, checkerboard and time-kill techniques. cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were highly active against e. coli and group b streptococci (mic90 0.05-0.1 mg/1) but not active against list. monocytogenes. penicillin g was more active than ampicillin and piperacillin against group b streptococci (mic90 0.1, 0.12 and 0.24 mg/l respectively) and ampicillin was the  most active against list. monocytogenes (mic90 0.6 mg/l). every double beta-lactam combination was synergistic for 3-14% of e. coli, 8-26% of group b streptococci and 67-100% of list. monocytogenes in the checkerboard titration. the ceftriaxone combinations were less synergistic than the cefotaxime combinations. in time-kill evaluations using concentrations representative for cerebrospinal fluid, the killing kinetics of e. coli were not influenced by any combination. a significant delay in killing of group b streptococci was observed  with penicillin g-cephalosporin and ampicillin-cephalosporin combinations. a significant increased killing of list. monocytogenes was observed with penicillin g-cephalosporin combinations. the other combinations did not alter the killing kinetics of group b streptococci and list. monocytogenes.

TI  == role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  == experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or hemophilus influenzae. the third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. cefotaxime has produced high cure  rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or h. influenzae. several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, or h. influenzae. moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. of 14 patients with pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by enterobacter, serratia, or acinetobacter. more, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.

AB  == we evaluated the activity of bmy-28142 against a k1 e. coli strain and a type iii group b streptococcal strain in vitro and in vivo and compared the results with those of cefotaxime and penicillin g, respectively. in vitro, the mics and mbcs of bmy-28142 were close to those of cefotaxime (less than or equal to 2-fold difference) for e. coli and fourfold less than those of penicillin g for group b  streptococci. in vivo studies with an experimental bacteremia and meningitis model in newborn rats revealed that the mean penetration of bmy-28142 into the cerebrospinal fluid was 15% that of concomitant levels in serum and that significantly greater bactericidal titers were achieved in blood and cerebrospinal fluid for both test organisms with bmy-28142 than with cefotaxime and penicillin g. however, the overall efficacy of bmy-28142 was similar to that  of cefotaxime for the e. coli infection and that of penicillin g for the group b  streptococcal infection. this was shown by similar rates of bacterial clearance from blood and cerebrospinal fluid and similar mortality rates. these findings indicate that the activity of bmy-28142 is bactericidal in vitro and in vivo against e. coli and group b streptococci, suggesting that this agent may be a suitable alternative for the therapy of e. coli and group b streptococcal bacteremia and meningitis.

TI  == plasma fibronectin concentrations in healthy and septic infants.
AB  == the concentration of plasma fibronectin was determined by laurell's electroimmunoassay in 75 preterm or term newborns within the first 2 days of life, in 97 healthy infants aged from 3 days to 12 months, in 40 septic infants and in 38 healthy adult subjects. the mean fibronectin concentration in citrated  plasma of normal adults was 318 +/- 84 ml/l. healthy eutrophic term newborns 1-2  days old had approximately one-third of the fibronectin concentration of adults.  there was no significant difference in the values between healthy term and eutrophic preterm newborns or between eutrophic and hypotrophic newborns. the plasma fibronectin increased strongly over the 1st month of life. no significant  difference was observed between fibronectin levels in infant boys and girls. the  values in septic newborns and septic older infants were significantly lower when  compared with those of age-matched healthy controls. it is speculated that this deficiency, because of linkage to fibrin in disseminated intravascular coagulation or due to increased utilisation as a nonspecific opsonin and sequestration at sites of tissue injury, may contribute to organ failure in septicaemia.

TI  == opsonic activity of cord blood sera against various species of microorganism.
AB  == the results of the present study on the opsonic activity of cord blood serum against various microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and group b streptococci) show that the activity of cord blood serum in promoting igg-mediated ingestion is equal to that of sera of healthy adults. this implies that igg concentrations, as assessed by immunochemical methods, in cord blood and adult sera represent functionally similar igg activities. ingestion of microorganisms involving complement-dependent opsonization was found to be of the same level for cord blood and adult sera, when the opsonization occurred via the  classical pathway of complement activation. however, due to decreased concentrations of factors b, p, and d in cord blood serum, optimal opsonization of microorganisms requiring the alternative pathway of complement was impaired. taken together, these results indicate that an opsonic defect of cord blood serum affects mainly microorganisms requiring opsonization via the alternative pathway  of complement.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

AB  == the difference in susceptibility to urinary tract infection between c3h/hej and c3h/hen mice was tested for with gram-negative strains differing in lipopolysaccharide composition. recently, impaired clearance of escherichia coli  from the kidney of c3h/hej compared to c3h/hen mice was shown to be correlated with the lps low responsiveness. in this study, a difference in clearance from the kidneys of c3h/hej and c3h/hen mice was found only with lipopolysaccharide-containing bacteria. gram-positive bacteria, e.g., staphylococcus saprophyticus and streptococcus agalactiae, were recovered in essentially equal numbers from the kidneys of mice of both strains. in contrast,  of the lipopolysaccharide-containing strains used, all persisted in higher numbers in the kidneys of c3h/hej mice than in the kidneys of c3h/hen mice. variations in the o side chain did not eliminate this difference. e. coli hu734 o75+k5+ and the rfb- mutant o75-k5+ remained in similar numbers in c3h/hej mice,  although o75-k5+ was eliminated more rapidly in c3h/hen mice. the core structure  did not affect the differential persistence in the two mouse strains. the rfb mutants with r1-r4 cores were eliminated after 24 h from the c3h/hen mice, but remained in significant numbers in the kidneys of c3h/hej mice. even the re mutant of salmonella minnesota persisted in low numbers in c3h/hej mice. the relative bacterial recovery from either mouse strain was related to the overall virulence of the infecting bacterial strain, but the difference between c3h/hej and c3h/hen mice was associated with responsiveness to parts of lipopolysaccharide common to the bacterial strains tested.

TI  == reversible inhibition of bacterial growth after specific inhibition of spermidine synthase by dicyclohexylamine.
AB  == the effect of dicyclohexylamine on seven freshly isolated bacterial strains of mastitis pathogens was studied. streptococcus uberis was the most sensitive strain investigated, since 5 mm-dicyclohexylamine totally arrested its growth and 1.25 mm of the drug caused 60% growth inhibition. the staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also sensitive to the drug, but less so than strep. uberis, since 5 mm drug caused only partial inhibition of growth. micrococcus sp. and klebsiella sp. grew in the presence of  10.0 mm-dicyclohexylamine, and, finally the growth of streptococcus agalactiae was not at all affected by dicyclohexylamine. these different sensitivities towards dicyclohexylamine in vivo were paralleled by different sensitivities of the bacteria's spermidine synthase to the drug in vitro, and also by the ability  of the drug to lower spermidine concentration in bacterial cells. spermidine synthase from sensitive bacteria was inhibited by more than 90% by 50 microm-dicyclohexylamine in vitro, and the concentration of spermidine was decreased in e. coli and ps. aeruginosa by 70% and in strep. uberis by 95%, whereas in strep. agalactiae 5 mm-dicyclohexylamine did not affect the concentration of spermidine at all. dicyclohexylamine treatment led to the accumulation of putrescine in strep. uberis. spermidine synthesis catalysed by the extracts of micrococcus sp. required 500 microm-dicyclohexylamine for 90% inhibition, and strep. agalactiae contained a spermidine synthase that was still  active at 1000 microm-dicyclohexylamine, the observed inhibition of growth was totally reversed by adding 50 microm-spermidine (final concentration) to the medium. putrescine reversed the inhibition only when bacteria had a spermidine synthase activity insensitive to dicyclohexylamine. spermine did not overcome the inhibition of growth caused by dicyclohexylamine, probably because it was not taken up by the bacterial cells used in this study. the inhibition of the growth  by dicyclohexylamine (even in the case of strep. uberis) was reversible in the sense that addition of 50 microm-spermidine 18 h after dicyclohexylamine still restored the growth rate of untreated controls.

TI  == management of neonatal meningitis, 1984.
AB  == neonatal bacterial meningitis continues to cause substantial mortality and morbidity despite the advent of new antimicrobial agents and of modern intensive  care facilities. in dallas, the case-fatality rate for bacterial meningitis in newborn and young infants is 17% (40 of 231 patients). three pathogens, group b streptococcus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes, accounted for 84% of  the causative agents. although new beta-lactam antibiotics have been extensively  evaluated in experimental meningitis due to these pathogens, there is limited clinical experience from which to judge efficacy and safety. currently, conventional therapy with ampicillin and an amino-glycoside should be used as initial empirical therapy for neonatal meningitis. once the pathogen has been identified and the susceptibilities determined, the most appropriate antibiotic or combination of antibiotics can be selected. latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefotaxime are highly active agents in vitro against gram-negative enteric bacilli and may prove useful for therapy of meningitis due to those organisms. additional experience with these compounds is required before they can be recommended for routine use.

TI  == assessment in the mouse of cefoperazone as a treatment for mastitis.
AB  == the value of cefoperazone in mastitis therapy was assessed in the mouse model of  mastitis primarily by its effect on bacterial cell numbers in the gland. in addition histological studies showed that the drug was not an irritant in the mammary gland. pharmacokinetic studies showed that it was slowly absorbed from the gland (six days to absorb 500 micrograms) but was easily removed by milking.  in ascending order of efficacy cefoperazone (500 micrograms/gland) was active against four-hour-old intramammary infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and strep uberis. the effect against staph aureus was titrated down to a dose of 50 micrograms/gland. cefoperazone was not bactericidal against intracellular staphylococci but it did sensitise them to the action of lytic enzyme. cefoperazone and cloxacillin behaved similarly against progressive staphylococcal mastitis. both antibiotics significantly reduced the bacterial numbers when four-hour-old infections were treated but the effect on 26-hour-old infections was perceptible only when each antibiotic was assayed against saline treatment in the mouse. the results suggest that further studies in dairy cattle should be undertaken.

TI  == relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  == objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the holstein-friesian association of america, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo)  infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between  indicators of mastitis. indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important  economically, but average differences were much smaller. selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.

TI  == use of the becton-dickinson urine culture tube with the abbott ms-2 urine screening system.
AB  == urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both becton-dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the abbott ms-2 urine screening system.  the time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci  or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and  antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from becton-dickinson tubes. by these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and becton-dickinson tubes. escherichia coli (n = 72), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group b streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. time for detection of positive urine samples  was similar in both types of tubes. delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by becton-dickinson tube transport. the ms-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. the becton-dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the ms-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.

TI  == lipid composition of milks from cows with experimentally induced mastitis.
AB  == changes in milk lipid composition were measured during the course of mastitis infections induced in cows by infusion of either escherichia coli endotoxin or streptococcus agalactiae into 2 quarters of the udder; untreated quarters were used as controls. experiments were divided into 3 distinct phases: a pre infusion period during which several samples were collected before infusion; a post infusion period following infusion and corresponding to the occurrence of elevated cell counts in milk from infused quarters; a recovery period followed after a short pause and represented the return of the cell count in milk from infused quarters to the level in the corresponding controls. milk total fatty acid composition was unaffected by the infusion. free fatty acid (ffa) composition did, however, undergo some alteration. there was a significant increase in long-chain saturated acids in milk from infused quarters relative to  the corresponding controls during the post infusion period. ffa concentration (mequiv./100 g fat) also increased significantly during this period although the  net increase was only slight. phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher post infusion in milk of infused quarters. the results suggest that changes in concentration and composition of those milk constituents  synthesized and secreted by the mammary epithelium occur after secretion in the alveolar lumen and milk ducts.

TI  == bacterial attachment to the chorioamniotic membranes.
AB  == intra-amniotic infections are believed to result from bacteria of cervical and vaginal origin which gain access to the amniotic sac. the logical sequence in this process would be bacterial attachment to the maternal surface, followed by migration through the chorioamniotic membranes to the fetal surface. fresh sterile chorioamniotic membranes were interposed between two arms of specially constructed incubation vessels. bacteria (escherichia coli, group b streptococci, or neisseria gonorrhoeae) were inoculated into the arm (containing a basal salt medium) contiguous with the maternal surface. the arm contiguous with the fetal surface of the membrane contained pseudoamniotic fluid. at intervals up to 24 hours after inoculation, the membranes were removed, washed, fixed in glutaraldehyde, and examined by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopes. the ability of group b streptococci and e. coli to attach to and invade the chorioamniotic membranes was demonstrated by this technique. it appeared that group b streptococci had a greater capacity to attach and invade than did e. coli, whereas n. gonorrhoeae predictably failed to attach.

TI  == correlation between opsonic activity for various microorganisms and composition of gammaglobulin preparations for intravenous use.
AB  == in this study 12 commercial immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration were investigated with respect to their opsonic activity for various strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and group b streptococci, and in addition, the concentration of unsplit igg molecules, igg fragments, and igg aggregates (dimers) was determined. the results show that four preparations that had been treated with enzyme or by reduction and alkylation had hardly any opsonic activity; the other preparations  were as effective as inactivated serum. a statistical analysis showed an excellent correlation between the concentration of intact igg molecules in a preparation and the opsonic activity for the various bacteria; a negative correlation between the concentration of igg fragments and the opsonic activity was found. the combination of the two techniques used in this study provides a basis for recommendations on the choice of gammaglobulin preparations for clinical use.

TI  == microflora and somatic cell content of goat milk.
AB  == the results of tests to determine the microflora and somatic cell content of 483  milk samples from 250 dairy goats in the north of scotland are presented. milk from uninfected udders had extremely low levels of bacterial contamination, 80 per cent of such samples having less than 100 bacteria/ml. one quarter of all samples were infected, the organisms isolated being coagulase negative staphylococci (83.5 per cent), coagulase positive staphylococci (12.4 per cent) streptococci (3.3 per cent) and escherichia coli (0.8 per cent). streptococcus agalactiae was not detected. somatic cell count levels were higher than those usually found in cows' milk: 33 per cent more than 2,000,000/ml; 22 per cent between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000/ml; 25 per cent between 500,000 and 1,000,000/ml; 22 per cent less than 500,000/ml. the levels of cell counts were similar for uninfected halves and halves infected with coagulase negative staphylococci. halves infected with coagulase positive staphylococci had much higher cell counts, eg, 73 per cent in excess of 2,000,000/ml. the interpretation of tests based on somatic cell content as indicators of mastitis in goats is discussed.

TI  == comparative opsonic activity of intravenous gamma globulin preparations for common bacterial pathogens.
AB  == immune globulin intravenous is a reduced and alkylated preparation of gamma globulin that is stabilized in 10 percent maltose and 0.1 m glycine at ph 6.8. recently, a modified immune globulin intravenous preparation was developed that is identical to the standard preparation except that it does not contain glycine  and the ph has been lowered to 5.25. the effect of these modifications has resulted in a higher igg monomer content in the preparation. in the present studies the opsonic activity against several common bacterial pathogens was assessed in the standard (ph 6.8) versus the more acidic immune globulin intravenous (ph 5.25). opsonic activity was detected in each preparation for staphylococcus aureus, group b streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, and serratia marcescens. with all of the organisms except s. marcescens, an intact complement system was required for optimal uptake and killing with each preparation. in general, the opsonic activity of the ph 5.25 immune globulin intravenous was equivalent to the standard ph 6.8 preparation. with several organisms, however, the more acidic preparation had greater activity than the standard one. an immune globulin intravenous preparation with increased antibody  titers to p. aeruginosa was also prepared from selected donors and tested for opsonic activity against six of the seven pseudomonas immunotypes. this preparation was found to have strikingly increased opsonic titers for most of the pseudomonas immunotypes when compared with the standard immune globulin intravenous. these studies indicate that changes in donor selection or minor modifications in production techniques may markedly affect the biologic activity  of intravenous gamma globulin.

TI  == studies of short-term pulmonary and peripheral vascular responses induced in oophorectomized sheep by the infusion of a group b streptococcal extract.
AB  == short-term (0-30 min) pulmonary and systemic vascular responses of oophorectomized ewes infused intravenously with a trichloroacetic acid (tca) extract of a type iii (strain 878) group b streptococcus (gbs) were studied. tca-878 extract induced significant pulmonary hypertension, reduction in femoral  artery pressure and reduced femoral artery po2. these responses were similar to those observed after the infusion of sublethal doses of e. coli endotoxin and could be prevented by priming the animal with ibuprofen or indomethacin. ewes rechallenged 48 h after their initial dose of tca-878 extract experienced pulmonary arterial pressure significantly higher than those induced by the first  infusion. similar augmented responses were not seen after rechallenge with endotoxin. larger doses of tca-878 extract resulted in increasingly higher pulmonary arterial pressure. we conclude that the venous infusion of tca extracts of gbs-878 induces significant pulmonary hypertension in sheep and that this response may be mediated by prostaglandins. the vasoactive substance extracted from these streptococci could play a role in promoting the vascular instability experienced by the human neonate with early onset gbs disease.

AB  == cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from pediatric patients with meningitis were  examined for their concentration of microbes and the relationship of this count to the bacteremia levels, microscopy results, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration. a total of 2,031 consecutive csf specimens were analyzed, of which 63 (3.1%) were positive by culture from the same number of patients. we observed  that 85% of the total csf specimens positive for haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis had counts in excess of 10(3) cfu/ml, with 56% of the specimens exceeding 10(5) cfu/ml. a correlation existed between the number of organisms present in the csf  and blood. for example, from a total of 22 patients who had counts of h. influenzae greater than 10(3) cfu/ml in the csf, 16 or 73% had levels of bacteremia greater than 10(3) cfu/ml. it was also noted that the bacterial concentration had a profound effect on the sensitivity of microscopy. the percentage of positive results increased from 25% with less than or equal to 10(3) cfu/ml to 60% in the range of greater than 10(3) to 10(5) cfu/ml and to 97% at concentrations of greater than 10(5) cfu/ml. furthermore, a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) was noted between the concentration of bacteria in the csf and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes observed on microscopy.

AB  == milk obtained from cows which were either infected by clinical mastitis or had been subjected to intramammary infusion of escherichia coli endotoxin possessed high counts of somatic cells and very high levels of proteinase activity which hydrolysed the caseins almost completely in a few hours at 37 degrees c. the rate of hydrolysis of beta-casein was slightly greater than that of alpha s1-casein, but in both cases hydrolysis was enhanced by 6 cycles of freezing and thawing to  disrupt somatic cell membranes. a study of the relationship between proteinase activity and cell count suggested that only some of the proteinase activity originated in the somatic cells and also that the identity of the cells making up the total cellular population was important. maximum proteolysis occurred at 50-60 degrees c, but the temperature-activity curve was a broad peak. likewise the ph versus activity plot was very broad and was almost flat over the ph range  6-9. experiments with a number of inhibitors of proteinases failed to give a clear cut pattern of inhibition. all evidence obtained was consistent with the view that several different enzymes with different ph and temperature optima and  different specificities contributed to the overall hydrolysis of caseins in these milks. from electrophoretic band patterns one of these enzymes was clearly plasmin, but in high cell count milks other proteinases also became significant.

TI  == milking frequency as related to udder health and milk production.
AB  == twenty-four cows each in two trials were paired on age, stage of lactation, and projected milk production to compare the incidence of mastitis with milking two or three times per day over 12 wk. teats of all cows were dipped daily in a suspension of streptococcus agalactiae (one of two strains). average daily milk production for the combined trials was 24.0 kg for the thrice daily group and 22.0 kg for the twice daily group. quarter foremilk samples were taken every 2 wk for somatic cell counts and bacterial isolations. somatic cell counts of cows milked twice per day averaged 31 x 10(3) per milliliter compared to 26 x 10(3) for three milkings. there were no significant differences in numbers of new bacterial infections between groups. cows milked twice per day had 41 new infections and 7 clinical infections and the three-time group had 39 new infections and 2 clinical infections. the many corynebacteria infections were related to the experimental design in which no disinfectant teat dip was used. three milkings per day did not affect udder health.

TI  == beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria responsible for neonatal meningitis.
AB  == neonatal meningitis is caused by group b streptococci (gbs), escherichia coli, and listeria monocytogenes, in order of frequency. newly developed cephalosporins with a broad spectrum of activity have altered the therapy of meningitis due to gram-negative bacilli. however, we found that clinical isolates of gbs and l. monocytogenes did not demonstrate uniform susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. antibiotic potencies for gbs tested were: cefotaxime, penicillin, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, cefamandole, cephalothin, and moxalactam. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was most active for l. monocytogenes followed by penicillin, cephalothin and chloramphenicol; broad-spectrum cephalosporins were not active against listeria organisms that were tested. these agents should not be utilized  as solitary therapy of meningitis until the organism has been characterized with  antibiotic susceptibilities.

TI  == bacteriological study of amniotic fluid during labor.
AB  == amniotic fluid from 207 women in labor was analysed at the time of artificial rupture of membranes or by amniocentesis. the following organisms were identified in concentrations of more than 1 000/ml: staphylococcus aureus (1), propionibacterium (1), e. coli (1), group b streptococci (3), lactobacilli (16).  the 6 patient-carriers of pathogens became infected as did 4 of their babies. leukocyte counts and ldh levels performed on amniotic fluid did not correlate with the appearance of symptoms of infection. quantitative bacteriology of amniotic fluid seems to be of value in identifying patients at high risk of developing endometritis and/or neonatal sepsis.

TI  == detection of gonococcal antigens by an indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative determination of proteolysis in mastitic milks.
AB  == proteolytic activity in mastitic skim-milk was often 5-10 fold higher than in normal milk, its level being related to somatic cell count but not precisely correlated with it. in milks with the highest levels of activity plasmin accounted for about one third of the total proteinase. a further third was sedimented with the micellar fraction together with the plasmin, but unlike plasmin, was not inhibited by addition of soyabean trypsin inhibitor (sbti). the  final third remained in the serum phase. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) showed that alpha-sl- and beta-caseins were degraded at about the same overall rate. the plasmin produced the usual readily identified fragments from beta-casein, but incubation of mastitic milk also produced changes in patterns in the gamma-casein region differing from plasmin-induced changes, which were also apparent when the micellar fraction was incubated. as they were inhibited by sbti, a second trypsin-like enzyme in addition to plasmin may also have been present. other proteinase(s) not inhibited by sbti was also associated with casein micelles and produced at least 3 characteristic protein fragments seen on  page. the serum phase proteinase(s) was likewise not inhibited by sbti, and did not produce any well-defined electrophoretic bands, suggesting a rather non-specific breakdown of caseins. after separation of mastitic whole milk, a considerable proportion of the proteolytic activity was found in the cream phase. the proportion was enhanced by freezing and thawing, and the enzyme appeared to be identical to the sbti-resistant micellar proteinase. because of the considerable proteolysis likely to occur under the time and temperature conditions involved, our results may provide some explanation for the problems encountered in cheesemaking with mastitic milks (e.g. yield losses, poor curd strength and off-flavour development).

TI  == mastitis: effect of ph, temperature, and emollients on disinfecting action of n,n-dimethyldodecanamine.
AB  == growth inhibition of bacteria over time by n,n-dimethyldodecanamine, a tertiary alkyl amine, was studied to evaluate disinfecting action with changes in ph and temperature and with addition of emollients. because alkyl amines have limited solubility in aqueous solutions, the effect of ph on solubility of the tertiary amine was determined. non-growing cultures of streptococcus agalactiae or escherichia coli were added to sterile buffer or buffer containing the amine, and at specific intervals aliquots were removed, neutralized in a lecithin/tween 80 quencher, and then plated to determine the number of surviving bacteria per plate. survival curves were used to determine the effect of changing environmental conditions on antimicrobial activity. antimicrobial activity was greater at ph 7 than at ph 8 and was least at ph 6. increases in temperature from 20 to 40 degrees c caused a corresponding increase in antimicrobial activity. addition of up to 10% glycerin or propylene glycol caused no significant decrease in antimicrobial activity of the tertiary amine.

TI  == short-time low-temperature pasteurisation of human milk.
AB  == using the oxford human milk pasteuriser human milk was exposed to lower temperature and shorter time periods than employed in classical holder pasteurisation. heating human milk at 62.5 degrees c for 5 min completely destroyed escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci inoculated into the samples. heating at 56.0 degrees c for 15 min destroyed over 99% of the inoculated organisms. the mean percentage remaining activity of certain antimicrobial proteins after heat treatment at 62.5 degrees c for 30 min, 62.5 degrees c for 5 min and 56 degrees c for 15 min were as follows: iga 67, and 90%; lactoferrin 27, 59 and 91%; and lysozyme 67, 96 and 106%, respectively. these results suggest that human milk can be effectively pasteurised using less heat treatment than in classical holder pasteurisation. lower temperature and shorter heat treatment also preserves substantially more of the activity of the antimicrobial proteins present in human milk.

TI  == functional bacterial opsonic activity of human amniotic fluid.
AB  == there are some data to suggest that amniotic fluid protects the fetus from invasion by pathogenic bacteria. to examine methods by which amniotic fluid may offer such protection, quantitative antibody, complement activity, and functional opsonic capacity were measured. immunoglobulins were measured by laser nephelometry and total hemolytic complement was determined by radial diffusion; results suggested activity adequate for bactericidal capacity. the chemiluminescence assay was used to quantitate the functional interaction between polymorphonuclear leukocytes and e. coli, group b streptococci (gbs), or zymosan  particles preopsonized with amniotic fluid obtained at different stages of gestation. results were compared to those for normal serum. data were analyzed by evaluation of the initial slope, area under the curve, and peak chemiluminescence response. opsonic activity of amniotic fluid for e. coli and gbs was demonstrated, with e. coli showing greater reactivity (maximum = 15,000 to 25,000 cpm) than gbs (10,000 to 20,000 cpm). specific, as well as nonspecific, opsonic activity was demonstrated by absorption of amniotic fluid with killed bacteria. concentration of amniotic fluid did not result in an increase in chemiluminescent activity, which demonstrates that optimal opsonic activity already exists. the classical and alternate pathways of complement were assessed for e. coli and gbs. preterm amniotic fluid did not differ in response from that of amniotic fluid obtained from term pregnancies. this study demonstrates that amniotic fluid can provide the fetus with protection from bacterial pathogens and delineates mechanisms for such protection.

TI  == effect of csf on bacterial growth.
AB  == the growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (s epidermidis) were compared using csf, trypticase soy broth (tsb), and a phosphate buffer. each grew less in csf than in tsb. escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between csf and tsb at 24 hours of growth, whereas s epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. the differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for e. coli. similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. the non-support of bacterial growth by csf may constitute a host defense  mechanism. the basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the csf.

TI  == sensitivities to antibiotics and seasonal occurrence of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == in a 2-yr survey of the clemson university's dairy herd, each sample of mastitic  milk was cultured, and mastitis pathogens were isolated. causative organisms then were subjected to disc assay of sensitivity to antibiotics. antibiotics were penicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, cephalothin (cephalosporin), ampicillin and novobiocin. the more widely used antibiotics--penicillin, streptomycin, and erythromycin--were relatively ineffective for bacterial sensitivity in vitro, whereas bacterial sensitivity in  vitro for oxytetracycline and cephalothin was considerably more. these results also were true in vivo in treatment of animals in the university herd. incidence  of mastitis under our conditions of weather, housing, and management increased greatly during summer months with less increase during winter months.

TI  == studies on the growth-inhibiting property of amniotic fluids from two united states population groups.
AB  == this study attempted to determine if lack of antimicrobial activity in amniotic fluid is the reason united states blacks have more amniotic fluid bacterial infection than whites. no significant interracial differences were found in a study of 111 fluids from whites and 56 fluids from blacks. it has been claimed that the phosphate:zinc ratio in amniotic fluid is an accurate predictor of antimicrobial activity. the present study found this often to be untrue. amniotic fluids that lacked antimicrobial activity gained such activity when zinc was added, but the in vitro zinc levels required were usually higher than observed physiologic concentrations. previous studies have claimed that antimicrobial activity first appears in the amniotic fluid in the third trimester of gestation. we found such activity in the majority of fluids by the end of the first trimester, with a staphylococcus aureus indicator; in contrast, with escherichia  coli and streptococcus agalactiae as test organisms, greater inhibition was observed after 35 weeks.

TI  == a survey of mastitis in the british dairy herd.
AB  == five hundred herds were examined to determine the prevalence of subclinical mastitis in the british dairy herd. the prevalences of the various infections recorded were streptococcus agalactiae 3.4 per cent of quarters, s dysgalactiae 1.1 per cent, s uberis 1.5 per cent and staphylococcus pyogenes 8.1 per cent. there were regional differences in the prevalence of some of these pathogens. the national prevalence of subclinical mastitis as defined by the international dairy federation was 9.6 per cent of all quarters. udder infections were less prevalent in herds where mastitis control measures were being used. the prevalence of infection also declined as the size of herd increased. however, as the uptake of  mastitis control measures was greater in the larger herds it seems likely that the widespread use of control measures was the most important factor responsible  for the relatively low prevalence of subclinical mastitis.

TI  == mastitis: ii. evaluation of antimicrobial amines for use as teat dips.
AB  == recent proposals by the food and drug administration to regulate teat dips as drugs have led to a search for safer teat dip ingredients. primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines (carbon-10 to -18 chain length) inhibit growth of mastitic bacteria (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichi coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) in a broth tube culture assay. since carbon-13 compounds were active, a carbon-13 primary (tridecanamine hydrochloride), secondary methyl (n-methyltridecanamine), secondary ethyl (n-ethyltridecanamine), tertiary dimethyl amine (n, n-dimethyltridecanamine), and carbon-12 quaternary amine (n, n, -trimethyldodecaneammonium chloride) were tested for their ability to reduce experimentally applied populations of s. agalactiae or e. coli on the bovine teat surface. the five compounds were compared at concentrations of 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,000, and 10,000 ppm. activity was greater against the gram-positive s. agalactiae than against the gram-negative e. coli. the tertiary amine was most active, producing a log reduction of 4 (reduction of bacterial number from 10(6) to 10(2)) at a concentration of 3,000 ppm in the teat dip. the relative order of effectiveness for the amines was: dimethyl tertiary greater than methyl secondary greater than  ethyl secondary greater than primary = quaternary. the results suggest that these amines may be useful as potent, effective antibacterial agents for incorporation  into teat dips.

AB  == in a study of breast milk collected into sterile bottles rinsed in 1% hypochlorite solution the hypochlorite solution adherent to the sides of the bottles apparently caused a large reduction in bacterial contamination of the milk after storage at 4 degrees c for up to four hours. heating expressed breast  milk at 62.5 degrees c for five minutes destroyed over 90% of the escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci inoculated  into the milk samples. rinsing collecting bottles with hypochlorite solution may  be valuable in collecting milk with a low bacterial content for human-milk banks. furthermore, the currently accepted pasteurisation time of 30 minutes may be excessive.

AB  == the activation of the terminal complement components, c3--9, plays an important role in the host's defense against infection. in the present study, the ability of bacteria to activate the third component of complement (c3) in newborn serum was examined. a variety of bacteria were incubated in test sera at 37 degrees c for 30 min and the percent of available c3 that was activated was measured. using one strain of escherchia coli (no. 3), 32% (mean) of the available c3 was activated in sera from 18 newborns, as compared to 85% in sera from their mothers and 79% in sera from 13 normal adults (p less than 0.005). in contrast, using another strain of e. coli (n70), the percent of c3 activated in newborn sera (83%) was the same as in sera from their mothers (81%) or in sera from normal adults (73%). the defective activation of c3 in newborn sera by e. coli was not related to the presence of the k1 antigen. newborn sera were also challenged with other bacterial species and the activation of c3 was deficient when tested with klebsiellae, but not with staphylococci or streptococci. the defect in newborn sera appeared to be due to a deficiency of a serum factor rather than to the presence of an inhibitor.

AB  == rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing triton x-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. the most sensitive method was broth culture. by microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. by micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically  easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.

AB  == an infusion of e. coli endotoxin (10 microgram) into the mammary gland of the cow 16 h before experimental infection with st. agalactiae prevented the establishment of mastitis. a clinical examination of the affected gland did not reveal signs of inflammation, all organisms were eliminated from the milk by 36 h after infection. mammary glands not pretreated with endotoxin, and injected with  the same number of viable streptococci, showed signs of severe inflammation the milk yield was reduced and the injected pathogen could be isolated from the gland for up to 14 days when sampling was discontinued. the injection of endotoxin alone produced a rapid increase in the cell count of the milk, there were some signs of inflammation and 80% of the cells in the milk were neutrophils. the cell counts in the milk remained above normal for 7-10 days. untreated control quarters appeared to be unaffected by the injection of e. coli endotoxin into an  adjacent quarter, on the other hand the injection of st. agalactiae into the adjacent quarter on the same side of the udder produced a cell response which reached a peak after 2 days and returned to preinoculation levels by the fourth day. no inflammation was observed in these control quarters and no streptococci were isolated from the milk.

AB  == the activities of branched and straight chain amines (10 to 18 carbons chain length) were compared in inhibiting the growth of five microorganisms that cause  about 95% of bovine mastitis. three gram-positive (streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria were used in a trypticase soy broth tube culture growth assay. sixty-two compounds were screened at concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ppm in broth culture to determine the effective minimum inhibitory concentration. alkyl secondary n-substituted monoethyl [ch3(ch2)nnhch2ch3] and tertiary n,n-substituted dimethyl [ch3(ch2) nn(ch3)2] amines with chain lengths of 11 to 14 carbon atoms were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. antimicrobial activity against gram-positive organisms increased with increasing chain length and carbon-14 to 18 amines were active at 1 to 5 ppm. the carbon-11 to 13 alkyl amines were most active against gram-positive organisms; longer chain amines (more than 14 carbons) were inactive. branching of the alkyl chain caused a loss of activity against gram-negative but not against gram-positive bacteria. antimicrobial testing of monoamines, polyamines, and the influence of order substituents were investigated to correlate structure-acitivity relationships.

AB  == the bacteriological quality of pooled human milk donated to the oxford milk bank  was analysed and the effects on bacteriology of sterilisation of the milk-collecting vessels in the home with hypochlorite solution and of holder pasteurisation in a purpose-built human-milk pasteuriser were studied. collecting milk in hypochlorite-sterilised vessels resulted in a significantly lower bacterial count of both pathogens and species of unlikely pathogenicity before pasteurisation and significantly increased the chance of pasteurisation giving a  sterile product. potentially pathogenic organisms grown in untreated milk were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and group b beta-haemolytic streptococci. seven species of organisms of unlikely pathogenicity were also identified. pasteurisation eliminated all potential pathogens from milk but did not reliably remove any of the species of unlikely pathogens. banked human milk may be contaminated with bacteria which are known to be capable of producing lipases, proteases, and decarboxylases. accurate pasteurisation, together with attention to the sterility of the collecting vessels, results in a bacteriologically safe product that retains many of the protective properties of  raw milk.

TI  == escherichia coli and group b streptococcal infections in experimental animals.
AB  == small doses of escherichia coli endotoxin or of viable e. coli caused only a mild illness in pregnant mice but severely impaired fetal development. after intravenous injection and after experimental renal infection e. coli multiplied in placental tissue, causing resorption of the conceptuses and sometimes fetal infection. it is suggested that in humans coliform bacteraemia sometimes results  in abortion and premature delivery because of the placental damage brought about  by e. coli and its abortifacient endotoxin. isolates of group b streptococci from various sites in 175 patients varied markedly in their pathogenicity for mice, and pregnant animals were less susceptible to infection than non-pregnant. in late pregnancy streptococci multiplied rapidly in placental tissue, suggesting that the placenta may be a significant focus of infection at the time of delivery. after antibiotic treatment the majority of mice infected with a highly  pathogenic strain died but the majority of those infected with a strain of low pathogenicity survived. preliminary experiments suggest that guinea-pigs and rabbits may be useful for studying the role of maternally derived antibodies in protecting the neonate against group b streptococci.

AB  == propolis is a substance produced by honeybees. it is inhibitory to some bacteria  species, mainly gram-positive bacteria, but less inhibitory to listeria monocytogenes (l.m) than to the other gram-positive bacteria tested. in order to  obtain selective growth of l.m. from contaminated samples, the effect of propolis in plating media and broths on various strains of bacteria was examined. table i  shows the effect of increasing concentrations of propolis in tryptose-agar (ta).  l.m. tolerated higher concentrations of propolis than streptococcus viridans and  staphylococcus aureus. l.m. grew well in tryptosebroth (tb) that contained 0.15 mg propolis pr. ml medium, while streptococcus viridans and streptococcus agalactiae were completely inhibited as seen in table ii. table iii shows that when serum was added to the agar, the inhibitory effect was reduced. it can also  be seen that gram-negative bacteria grew quite well on media that contained 0.19  mg propolis pr. ml. to reduce the growth of gram-negative bacteria, nalidixic acid was added to the medium. table iv illustrates growth of various species of bacteria in tryptosephosphatebroth (tfb) with or without propolis and nalidixic acid. most of the strains tested were inhibited, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and to some extent faecal streptococci were able to grow in the medium that contained the selective substances. as a conclusion it seems that propolis may be a valuable additive to a medium for the selective isolation of l.m.

AB  == the experience with neonatal sepsis at the johns hopkins hospital during 1969-1975 was reviewed. major pathogens included escherichia coli, group b streptococcus, other streptococci, and klebsiella. nineteen percent of coliform isolates were kanamycin-resistant. the frequency of recovery of e. coli was increased in early-onset sepsis, and the frequency of recovery of klebsiella was  increased in late-onset sepsis. the mortality rate was 23%. the frequency of recovery of e. coli was increased in fatal cases, and mortality was highly correlated with the presence of gastrointestinal catastrophe. ampicillin and gentamicin are the initial antibiotics of choice for neonatal sepsis at this institution; a penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be added when staphylococcus aureus involvement is likely, and addition of chloramphenicol or clindamycin should be considered for infants at increased risk for bacteroides fragilis sepsis.

TI  == effect of amniotic fluid on bacterial growth.
AB  == the bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was studied using four pathogenic organisms which are encountered in the perinatal period, e. coli, s. aureus, l. monocytogenes, and group b beta hemolytic streptococci. amniotic fluid inhibited  the growth of all four organisms, with a wide degree of individual variation among specimens. the greatest degree of inhibition was noted for l. monocytogenes and the least for e. coli. the time in gestation in which the amniotic fluid sample was obtained did not appear to be related to its bacteriostatic capacity.  the ability of amniotic fluid to inhibit the growth of certain pathogenic organisms may be significant in prevention of perinatal infection.

TI  == [infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with klebsiella mastitis].
AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == cytologic features of bone marrow in normal and mastitic cows.
AB  == rib bone marrow was aspirated from normal cows and from cows with experimentally  induced or naturally acquired mastitis. nucleated cell counts in marrow films were made on the basis of differentiation of 500 cells. the myeloid/erythroid ratio was less than 1.0 in normal cows and generally greater than 1.0 in mastitic cows. the marrow reserve of mature neutrophils was nearly depleted in response to experimentally induced streptococcus agalactiae mastitis (4th postinoculation day) or in an acute flare-up of naturally acquired str agalactiae mastitis. a dose of 0.05 mg of escherichia coli endotoxin, introduced into a single, normal,  lactating quarter produced similar results within 8 hours. concurrently, with depletion of marrow reserves of mature neutrophils, a neutropenia with left shift developed in the blood, and immature granulocytes increased in the marrow. the intensification of granulopoiesis returned the marrow reserves to normal or above normal within a period of 4 to 5 days, thereby reestablishing homeostasis.

TI  == adherence of bacterial to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == vaginal epithelial cells from healthy women were washed and incubated in tissue culture medium with freshly isolated bacteria of the indigenous vaginal flora and with bacteria of species that have been discussed in conjunction with genital infections. after incubation and washing, the number of bacteria that adhered per cell was determined. the influence on the attachment rate of such factors as variations in the washing procedure, bacterial density, and incubation time was assessed. lactobacillus acidophilus and other bacterial species that occur in the lower genital tract of healthy women, e.g., some strictly anaerobic species, adhered by significantly lower numbers per cell than neisseria gonorrhoeae, group b streptococci, and corynebacterium vaginale. significantly more freshly isolated gonococci adhered per cell than gonococci that had been passaged on artificial medium. the adherence of gonococci increased with increasing acidity of the test  medium.

TI  == immunochemical characterization of the "native" type iii polysaccharide of group  b streptococcus.
AB  == the type iii polysaccharide of -roup b streptococcus has been isolated and purified by a method that employs washing of intact cells at neutral ph. that the polysaccharide prepared by this procedure is the "native" type iii antigen is suggested by its molecular size in excess of 10(6) daltons, its degradation by acid and heat treatment to a fragment with immunologic characteristics of the classical hcl antigen, and its type-specific serologic activity. the type iii polysaccharide in native form contains sialic acid, galactose, glucose, glucosamine, heptose, and mannose. it is acidic in nature, is resistant to neuramindiase degradation, contains no o-acetyl groups, and does not share antigenic determinants with capsular type k1 antigen of escherichia coli or group b polysaccharide antigen of neiserria meningitidis.

TI  == meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  == colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. since the microcontour of the canine distal  urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina.  the normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. it consisted principally of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium and acinetobacter-haemophilus. estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-streptococcus and acinetobacter-haemophilus. a normal canine transient, escherichia coli, and a normal resident, corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. in contrast, human escherichia coli and pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus  (8.5 days). the commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the  susceptibility to colonization.

TI  == selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. s. agalactiae and s. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered  poorly or not at all. the organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. these data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.

TI  == [etiology of dairy cows mastitis in slovakia in the years 1972-1974].
AB  == in the period from 1972 to 1974, veterinary institutes in slovakia performed bacteriological examinations in 178,853 milk samples coming from 72,454 dairy cows. on an annual average, the number of examined samples were higher by 61% than in 1967-1971. germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 22.32% of the dairy cows. the following bacterial germs were represented: streptococcus agalactiae -- 15.77%, staphylococcus aureus -- 4.19%, other streptococci -- 1.49%, e. coli -- 0.18%, klebsiella sp. -- 0.23%, corynebacterium pyogenes -- 0.20%, other germs -- 0.26%. the number of dairy cows having bacterial germs in their milk was found higher by 1.47% than in 1967-1971. the number of the findings of streptococcus agalactiae was higher by 3.29% and that of staphylococcus aureus by 1.15% than in the period from 1967 to 1971. the  higher number of the findings of the bacterial causative agents responsible for mastitis was due, in particular, to the increased number of the findings of streptococcus agalactiae in milk.

TI  == cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group d streptococci.
AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
