TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB  == in this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (gf) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. the fermentations were initiated by the  spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions  (a and b). sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. the composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques.  overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, kazachstania and candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative lab, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. however, the spontaneous fermentation of the gf flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc holzapfelii, lactobacillus  gallinarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus graminis  and weissella cibaria. in general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst lactobacillus plantarum  dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. lactobacillus pontis is described for the  first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. among yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition a. this study allowed the identification and isolation of lab and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to gf bread production.

TI  == growth characterization of individual rye sourdough bacteria by isothermal microcalorimetry.
AB  == aims: the present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. methods and  results: strains of the individual lab isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kgy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. the od-time curves of  the lab strains during growth in flour extract or mrs (de man, rogosa and sharpe) broth were also determined. the maximum specific growth rates of lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial  sourdough. industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below ph 4.8. it was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the o(2) protective effect of rye  sourdough. conclusions: measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the lab strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. significance and impact of the study: isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method  for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.
