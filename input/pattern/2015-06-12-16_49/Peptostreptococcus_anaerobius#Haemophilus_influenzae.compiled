TI  - Liquid based microbiological transport systems: conformity assessment of two commercial devices.
AB  - We compared two types of liquid-based microbiology devices for microorganism viability according to standardized quantitative elution method CLSI M40-A2. The eSwab(R) met CLSI acceptance criteria of viability maintenance for all microorganisms tested. The Sigma-Transwab(R) failed to meet CLSI acceptance criteria for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Despite limitations of swab transport systems (STS), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. We evaluated the performance of 4 commercial STS: M40 Transystem (S1, Copan Italia, Bovezzo, Italy), UNI-TER (S2, MEUS, Piove di Sacco, Italy), Euromed (S3, LAB SERVICE, Surbo, Italy), and Eurotubo (S4, Deltalab, Rubi, Spain). Survival of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (NCCLS M40-A) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. After 24 h, only S1 was able to maintain Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305), Haemophilus influenzae (10211), and Neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all STS except S1 (46% recovery). Eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for Fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with S1. Resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the STS.
TI  - [Two cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Haemophilus influenzae].
AB  - Most of Bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. However, we have encountered two very interesting cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. In the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (CFDN), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated S. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). After an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In the second case, after an incision and drainage of Bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (AMPC), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. However, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Haemophilus influenzae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated H. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR). After performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, CFTM-PI, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In addition, the analysis of these two cases using PK/PD theory revealed that the time above MIC reached 100% with administration of CFTM-PI 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. There are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. In addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on PK/PD theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.
TI  - Bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  - The effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. Before therapy, potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. Following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. However, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella melaninogenica. Fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. After therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (P< 0.001).
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
