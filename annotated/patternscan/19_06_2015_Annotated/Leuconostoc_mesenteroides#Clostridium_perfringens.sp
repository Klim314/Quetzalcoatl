TI  == characterization of bacteriocin like inhibitory substance produced by a new strain brevibacillus borstelensis ag1 isolated from 'marcha'.
AB  == in the present study, a bacterium isolated from marcha- a herbal cake used as traditional starter culture to ferment local wine in north east india, was evaluated for bacteriocin like inhibitory substance production and was tested against six food borne/spoilage causing pathogens viz. listeria monocytogenes mtcc 839, bacillus subtilis mtcc 121, clostridium perfringens mtcc 450, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides mtcc 107 by using bit/disc method followed by well diffusion method. the bacterial isolate was identified as brevibacillus borstelensis on the basis of phenotypic,  biochemical and molecular characteristics using 16sr rna gene technique. bacteriocin like inhibitory substance produced by brevibacillus borstelensis ag1  was purified by gel exclusion chromatography. the molecular mass of the brevibacillus borstelensis ag1 was found to be 12 kda. purified bacteriocin like  inhibitory substance of brevibacillus borstelensis was further characterized by studying the effect of temperature, ph, proteolytic enzyme and stability. bacteriocin like inhibitory substance was found to be thermostable upto 100 degrees c, active at neutral ph, sensitive to trypsin, and partially stable till  third week of storage thus showing a bright prospective to be used as a potential food biopreservative.

TI  == the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus has a novel structure.
AB  == in methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, oxaloacetate synthesis is a major and  essential co(2)-fixation reaction. this methanogenic archaeon possesses two oxaloacetate-synthesizing enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from this organism was purified  to homogeneity. the subunit size of this homotetrameric protein was 55 kda, which is about half that of all known bacterial and eukaryotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (ppcs). the nh(2)-terminal sequence identified this enzyme as the product of mth943, an open reading frame with no assigned function in the genome  sequence. a blast search did not show an obvious sequence similarity between mth943 and known ppcs, which are generally well conserved. this is the first report of a new type of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase that we call ppca ("a" for "archaeal"). homologs to ppca were present in most archaeal genomic sequences, but only in three bacterial (clostridium perfringens, oenococcus oeni, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) and no eukaryotic genomes. ppca was the only recognizable oxaloacetate-producing enzyme in methanopyrus kandleri, a hydrothermal vent organism. each ppca-containing organism lacked a ppc homolog. the activity of m. thermautotrophicus ppca was not influenced by acetyl coenzyme  a and was about 50 times less sensitive to aspartate than the escherichia coli ppc. the catalytic core (including his(138), arg(587), and gly(883)) of the e. coli ppc was partly conserved in ppca, but three of four aspartate-binding residues (lys(773), arg(832), and asn(881)) were not. ppcs probably evolved from  ppca through a process that added allosteric sites to the enzyme. the reverse is  also equally possible.

TI  == thermotolerance of meat spoilage lactic acid bacteria and their inactivation in vacuum-packaged vienna sausages.
AB  == heat resistance of three meat spoilage lactic acid bacteria was determined in vitro. d-values at 57, 60 and 63 degrees c were 52.9, 39.3 and 32.5 s for lactobacillus sake, 34.9, 31.3 and 20.2 s for leuconostoc mesenteroides and 22.5, 15.6 and 14.4 s for lactobacillus curvatus, respectively. the three lactic acid bacteria were heat sensitive, as one log reductions in numbers were achieved at 57 degrees c in less than 60 s. z-values could not be accurately determined as d-values did not change by a factor of 10 over the temperature range studied. in-package pasteurization processes were calculated using the highest in vitro d-value and applied to vacuum-packaged vienna sausages. microbiological shelf life (time for lactic acid bacteria count to reach 5 x 10(6) cfu/g) increased from 7 days for non-pasteurized samples to 67, 99 and 119 days for samples of the three pasteurization treatments at 8 degrees c storage. enterobacteriaceae were detected at levels of log 4.0 cfu/g in non-pasteurized samples, but were reduced  to < log 1.0 cfu/g in pasteurized samples. the incidence of listeriae in non-pasteurized samples was low as only one listeria innocua strain was isolated. no listeria spp. were isolated from pasteurized samples. numbers of clostridium isolates increased from one in non-pasteurized samples to 25 in pasteurized samples. increasing incidences of clostridia, and the presence of c. perfringens  in pasteurized samples indicated that in-package pasteurization could compromise  product safety.
