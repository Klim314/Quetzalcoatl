TI  == the biohydrogenation of alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid by rumen micro-organisms.
AB  == 1. alpha-[u-(14)c]linolenic acid was incubated with the rumen contents of sheep and the metabolic products were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography and absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared. 2. a tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. the main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic  acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic  acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. pure cultures of clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids  compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.
