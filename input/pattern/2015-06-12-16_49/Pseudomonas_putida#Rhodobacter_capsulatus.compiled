TI  - A T7 RNA polymerase-based toolkit for the concerted expression of clustered genes.
AB  - Bacterial genes whose enzymes are either assembled into complex multi-domain proteins or form biosynthetic pathways are frequently organized within large chromosomal clusters. The functional expression of clustered genes, however, remains challenging since it generally requires an expression system that facilitates the coordinated transcription of numerous genes irrespective of their natural promoters and terminators. Here, we report on the development of a novel expression system that is particularly suitable for the homologous expression of multiple genes organized in a contiguous cluster. The new expression toolkit consists of an Omega interposon cassette carrying a T7 RNA polymerase specific promoter which is designed for promoter tagging of clustered genes and a small set of broad-host-range plasmids providing the respective polymerase in different bacteria. The uptake hydrogenase gene locus of the photosynthetic non-sulfur purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus which consists of 16 genes was used as an example to demonstrate functional expression only by T7 RNA polymerase but not by bacterial RNA polymerase. Our findings clearly indicate that due to its unique properties T7 RNA polymerase can be applied for overexpression of large and complex bacterial gene regions.
TI  - Reporter proteins for in vivo fluorescence without oxygen.
AB  - Fluorescent reporter proteins such as green fluorescent protein are valuable noninvasive molecular tools for in vivo real-time imaging of living specimens. However, their use is generally restricted to aerobic systems, as the formation of their chromophores strictly requires oxygen. Starting with blue-light photoreceptors from Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida that contain light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domains, we engineered flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent proteins that can be used as fluorescent reporters in both aerobic and anaerobic biological systems.
TI  - Active site geometry and substrate recognition of the molybdenum hydroxylase quinoline 2-oxidoreductase.
AB  - The soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida 86 uses quinoline as a sole source of carbon and energy. Quinoline 2-oxidoreductase (Qor) catalyzes the first metabolic step converting quinoline to 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline. Qor is a member of the molybdenum hydroxylases. The molybdenum ion is coordinated by two ene-dithiolate sulfur atoms, two oxo-ligands, and a catalytically crucial sulfido-ligand, whose position in the active site was controversial. The 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of Qor indicates that the sulfido-ligand occupies the equatorial position at the molybdenum ion. The structural comparison of Qor with the allopurinol-inhibited xanthine dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter capsulatus allows direct insight into the mechanism of substrate recognition and the identification of putative catalytic residues. The active site protein variants QorE743V and QorE743D were analyzed to assess the catalytic role of E743.
TI  - Sulfide oxidation in gram-negative bacteria by expression of the sulfide-quinone  reductase gene of Rhodobacter capsulatus and by electron transport to ubiquinone.
AB  - The oxidation of sulfide was studied in recombinant bacteria expressing the sulfide-quinone reductase gene (sqr) from Rhodobacter capsulatus. Sulfide was oxidized by the Escherichia coli strain W3110 harboring the sqr construct (pKKSQ) under anaerobic conditions and nitrate was utilized as a terminal electron acceptor. Following the oxidation, elemental sulfur and nitrite were produced as the final reaction products. This activity was retained in the membrane preparation and was sensitive towards antimycin A, stigmatellin, and azide. As a consequence of the ubiquinone deficiency, this activity was markedly decreased. In additon, by recovery of ubiquinone, the oxidation was also restored to rates similar to those of the wild-type strain. These results indicate that sulfide oxidation in this strain occurs via the quinone pool in vivo, and that this sulfide-quinone reductase (SQR) in particular utilizes ubiquinone as a more appropriate electron acceptor than menaquinone or demetylmenaquinone. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a direct interaction between SQR and ubiquinone in cells. When expressed in Pseudomonas putida and Rhizobium meliloti, the SQR conferred on these organisms the ability to oxidize sulfide as well as E. coli in vivo.
TI  - Proline catabolism by Pseudomonas putida: cloning, characterization, and expression of the put genes in the presence of root exudates.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2442 is a root-colonizing strain which can use proline, one  of the major components in root exudates, as its sole carbon and nitrogen source. A P. putida mutant unable to grow with proline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated after random mini-Tn5-Km mutagenesis. The mini-Tn5 insertion was located at the putA gene, which is adjacent to and divergent from the putP gene. The putA gene codes for a protein of 1,315 amino acid residues which is homologous to the PutA protein of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and several Rhizobium strains. The central part of P. putida PutA showed homology to the proline dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, whereas the C-terminal end was homologous to the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae and a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases. This suggests that in P. putida, both enzymatic steps for proline conversion to glutamic acid are catalyzed by a single polypeptide. The putP gene was homologous to the putP genes of several prokaryotic microorganisms, and its gene product is an integral inner-membrane protein involved in the uptake of proline. The expression of both genes was induced by proline added in the culture medium and was regulated by PutA. In a P. putida putA-deficient background, expression of both putA and putP genes was maximal and proline independent. Corn root exudates collected during 7 days also strongly induced the P. putida put genes, as determined by using fusions of the put promoters to 'lacZ. The induction ratio for the putA promoter (about 20-fold) was 6-fold higher than the induction ratio for the putP promoter.
TI  - A homolog of the Rhizobium meliloti nitrogen fixation gene fixN is involved in the production of a microaerobically induced oxidase activity in the phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  - Hybridization analysis using the Rhizobium meliloti nitrogen fixation gene fixN as a probe revealed the presence of a homologous DNA region in the phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Hybridization signals were also detected with total DNAs of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, Rhodobacter capsulatus and Escherichia coli, but not those of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Pseudomonas putida. The hybridizing fragment from A. tumefaciens was cloned and sequenced. The predicted gene product of one of the two open reading frames identified on the sequenced fragment shows homology to FixN of different Rhizobiaceae as well as a low but significant similarity to subunit I of heme copper oxidases from various bacteria. The presence of five strictly conserved histidine residues previously implicated in forming ligands to heme and CuB in oxidases and the predicted membrane topology provide evidence that the A. tumefaciens fixN-like gene product is a component of the heme copper oxidase superfamily. The incomplete open reading frame starting only 8 nucleotides downstream of the fixN-like gene exhibits homology to Rhizobium fixO. Using an uidA (GUS) gene fusion it could be shown that the A. tumefaciens fixN-like gene is preferentially expressed under microaerobic conditions. Expression of the uidA fusion is abolished in R. meliloti fixJ and fixK mutants, indicating that an Fnr-like protein is involved in transcriptional regulation of the fixN-like gene in A. tumefaciens. The presence of an upstream DNA sequence motif identical to the Fnr-consensus binding site (anaerobox) further supports this hypothesis. A. tumefaciens mutated in the fixN-like gene shows decreased TMPD-specific oxidase activity under microaerobic conditions, indicating that the fixN-like gene or operon codes for proteins involved in respiration under reduced oxygen availability.
TI  - Purification of a sixth ferredoxin from Rhodobacter capsulatus. Primary structure and biochemical properties.
AB  - A new ferredoxin has been purified from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter  capsulatus. It is the sixth ferredoxin to be isolated from this bacterium and it was called FdVI. Its primary structure was established based on amino acid sequence analysis of the protein and of peptides derived from it. It is composed of 106 residues including five cysteines. The calculated mass of the polypeptide is 11,402.6 Da which matches the experimental value determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that ferredoxin VI (FdVI) is strikingly similar to a ferredoxin from Caulobacter crescentus and to the putidaredoxin from Pseudomonas putida. FdVI exhibited an ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum typical for a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. EPR spectroscopy of the reduced protein showed a nearly axial signal similar to that of mitochondrial and P. putida ferredoxins. FdVI is biosynthesized in cells growing anaerobically under either nitrogen-sufficient or nitrogen-deficient conditions. Although the function of FdVI is unknown, its structural resemblance to [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins known to transfer electrons to oxygenases such as P-450 cytochromes, suggests that FdVI may have a similar role in R. capsulatus.
