survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in yoghurt during preparation and storage at 4 degrees c.
cow's milk was inoculated with ca 10(3) and 10(7) cfu ml-1 escherichia coli o157:h7. after fermentation at 42 degrees c for 0-5 h, the yoghurt was stored at 4 degrees c. two kinds of yoghurt were used: traditional yoghurt (ty), made with streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus starter cultures, and 'bifido' yoghurt (by), made with the two starter cultures plus bifidobacterium bifidum. after 7 d e. coli o157:h7 decreased from 3.52 to 2.72 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.08 to 5.32 log10 cfu ml-1 in ty, and from 3.49 to 2.73 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.38 to 5.41 log10 cfu ml-1 in by. the ph values of yoghurt dropped from 6.6 to 4.5 and 4.4 in ty (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively), and from 6.6 to 4.6 and 4.5 in by (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively).
[antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
