TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance of chicken escherichia coli, salmonella spp., and pasteurella multocida isolates.
AB  == escherichia coli, salmonella species, and pasteurella multocida are the major bacterial pathogens isolated from poultry. difference in susceptibility to antibiotics by microorganisms has become a major factor in drug choice and success of treatment. great concerns have been raised regarding emerging antimicrobial resistance among bacteria that may result in unpredictable antimicrobial susceptibility and failure of therapy. the primary objective of the present study was to determine the levels of antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance of e. coli, salmonella species, and p. multocida isolated from diseased chickens. a total of 445 e. coli isolates, 387 salmonella  spp. isolates, and 80 p. multocida isolates from diseased chickens during the period ranging from 2001 to 2003 were obtained. minimal inhibitory concentrations of 14 antimicrobial agents against each bacterial isolate were determined using a microbroth dilution assay described by the clinical laboratory standards institute. resistance of e. coli isolates measured as follows: 98.20% were resistant to tilmicosin, 79.33% to tetracycline, 51.46% to spectinomycin, 44.04%  to gentamicin, and 40% to ampicillin. resistance to tetracycline was found in 72.61% of salmonella spp. isolated, followed by resistance to spectinomycin (68.48%), ampicillin (63.57%), gentamicin (63.31%), and ticarcillin (61.76%). the resistance rate of p. multocida isolates to all antimicrobials tested was less than 5%, except for tetracycline (6.25%). in summary, e. coli and salmonella isolates were sensitive to ceftiofur and fluoroquinolones but were resistant to other antimicrobials tested, while p. multocida isolates remained sensitive to all the antimicrobial agents tested in a 3-yr analysis.

TI  == nonspecific cellular defense of the avian respiratory system: a review.
AB  == the normal, steady-state, avian respiratory system has very low numbers of residing avian respiratory phagocytes (arp). birds must rely heavily on the influx of arp to defend against infectious agents. the system is refractory to elicitation by inert stimulants, but responds efficiently to replicating bacteria, with very rapid influx of large numbers of activated arp (polymorphonuclear neutrophils, heterophils, and macrophages) with increased phagocytic proportions and capacities. the numbers subside within a few a days. activated arp act in a non agent-specific manner: pasteurella multocida-activated arp can defend against a severe escherichia coli airsacculitis. parenteral routes of stimulation generally are not, respiratory routes are very, efficient in activating arp. heterophils are the most efficient in defensive reactions, such as oxidative burst, production of nitric oxide and killing of bacteria. respiratory viruses may stimulate, but also may diminish some of the defensive functions of arp. this is also true for attenuated, modified live virus vaccines. these vaccines must be used carefully in the presence of subclinical bacterial, mycoplasmal infections. published literature on non-specific cellular defense of  the avian respiratory system is very limited, particularly about interactions among multiple infectious agents and the system.

TI  == in vitro microbiological characterization of novel macrolide cp-163,505 for animal health specific use.
AB  == a novel 16-membered-ring macrolide agent (cp-163,505, a reductive amination derivative of repromicin) was identified as an antibacterial against pasteurella  haemolytica, p. multocida and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, important etiological agents of livestock respiratory disease. in vitro mic50/90 analysis revealed that cp-163,505 was more potent (4x) than tilmicosin against p. multocida, and equivalent to tilmicosin against p. haemolytica and a. pleuropneumoniae. in time kill kinetic studies, cp-163,505 showed bactericidal activity against p. haemolytica, p. multocida and a. pleuropneumoniae and bacteriostatic activity against e. coli at 8 times its mic. in vitro, cp-163,505  was more potent in alkaline ph (16 approximately 32 x ) and less potent in the presence of excess cations (mg+2 and ca+2, 4x). edta and pmbn increased cp-163,505 potency against e. coli (4x) but not against the other species. similar results were obtained with erythromycin a and tilmicosin, which were used as controls. from our data, we hypothesize that pasteurella and actinobacillus have an outer membrane significantly different from that of the typical enteric gram-negative bacterium e. coli.

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
