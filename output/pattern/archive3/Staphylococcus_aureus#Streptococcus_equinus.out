bovicin hc5 and nisin reduce staphylococcus aureus adhesion to polystyrene and change the hydrophobicity profile and gibbs free energy of adhesion.
staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen often multidrug-resistant that not only causes a variety of human diseases, but also is able to survive on biotic and abiotic surfaces through biofilm communities. the best way to inhibit biofilm establishment is to prevent cell adhesion. in the present study, subinhibitory concentrations of the bacteriocins bovicin hc5 and nisin were tested for their capability to interfere with the adhesion of s. aureus to polystyrene. subinhibitory dosages of the bacteriocins reduced cell adhesion and this occurred probably due to changes in the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell and polystyrene surfaces. after treatment with bovicin hc5 and nisin, the surfaces became more hydrophilic and the free energy of adhesion (g(adhesion)) between bacteria and the polystyrene surface was unfavorable. the transcriptional level of selected genes was assessed by rt-qpcr approach, revealing that the bacteriocins affected the expression of some important biofilm associated genes (icad, fnba, and clfb) and rnaiii, which is involved in the quorum sensing mechanism. the conditioning of food-contact surfaces with bacteriocins can be an innovative and powerful strategy to prevent biofilms in the food industry. the results are relevant for food safety as they indicate that bovicin hc5 and nisin can inhibit bacterial adhesion and consequent biofilm establishment, since cell adhesion precedes biofilm formation.
a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60 mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
bovine mastitis in finland 2001--prevalence, distribution of bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance.
a nationwide survey was conducted in finland to estimate prevalence of bovine mastitis, distribution of mastitis pathogens, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different mastitis pathogens. in total, 12,661 quarter milk samples were collected from 3282 dairy cows at 216 farms. these were randomly selected from a database covering all finnish dairy farms. quarter milk samples collected by the dairy advisors were submitted for somatic cell counting, bacteriological examination, and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. if the milk scc of a cow or of a quarter exceeded 300,000/ml, the cow was defined as having mastitis. the results were compared with those of a previous survey done in 1995. the prevalence of mastitis continued to decrease from 38% in 1995 to 31% in 2001. compared with the study from 1995, the number of quarters with bacterial growth in 2001 increased significantly from 21.0 to 33.5%. this mainly resulted from increased prevalence of corynebacterium bovis. coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most common bacterial group, comprising almost one-half of the pathogens isolated, whereas the relative number of staphylococcus aureus isolations decreased from the time of the previous study. according to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the enterococci demonstrated the highest level of resistance. compared with the other nordic countries, penicillin resistance among the staphylococci was still at a relatively high level in finland (52.1 and 32.0% for staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively). streptococci isolated from mastitis were very susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, as also found in the previous survey in 1995.
spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (pnu-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.
association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
objective: to determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (scc) of bulk tank milk. design: analysis of records. sample population: milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between march 1992 and june 1994. procedure: results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk scc among herds. results: prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk scc. in herds free of s agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of s aureus and corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. for herds without s agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in scc and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced scc in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had s agalactiae mastitis. in herds with s agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in scc. only use of sodium chlorite-lactic acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in scc in herds without s agalactiae mastitis. clinical implications: important factors associated with bulk tank milk scc were prevalence of s agalactiae and s aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area, and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.
positive inotropic effect of streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees c, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in krebs-ringer solution (1.25 mm ca2+, 35 degrees c). the endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (tt) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (vmax) and significant decreases in time to tt (tttt) and time to half isometric twitch tension decline (rt 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. this response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with kio4. increasing ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on tt and vmax while abolishing the effects on tttt and on rt 1/2. by contrast, streptococcus bovis and staphylococcus aureus did not affect tt or vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in tttt at the highest concentration of bacteria. accordingly, the filtrate of strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. the active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. strep. bovis and staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6r, 7r)-7-[[(z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1h-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. fk-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of fk-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. the mic of fk-037 for 90% of the strains tested (mic90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus bovis. the mic90 for many of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. the mic90 for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. k. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime mics of > 32 micrograms/ml with bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of fk-037 per ml. e. cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and s. aureus stably resistant to fk-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of fk-037. the fk-037 mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. xanthomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter anitratus, and bacteroides species were resistant to fk-037 (mic, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). mbcs were identical to or within twofold of the mics except for a 32-fold greater mbc for p. aeruginosa. inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of fk-037. fk-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. nonetheless, fk-037 inhibited bacteria possessing tem-3, -5, and -7 and shv -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. overall, fk-037 has lower mics against staphylococci and p. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
in-vitro activity of win 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for s. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. all lancefield group a, b, c, & g streptococci, streptococcus bovis and s. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. for anaerobic bacteria win 57273 had an mic90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. win 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. the mic90 of win 57273 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. win 57273 was more active against gram-negative bacteria at acid ph, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
[detection of causative bacteria for bovine mastitis and their susceptibility to  beta-lactam antibacterial agents].
during the period from november 1988 to may 1989, causative bacteria in a total of 172 clinical mastitis cases observed in 66 farms in 5 districts with 6 areas in japan were examined and frequencies of their occurrences were determined. susceptibilities (in mics) of the isolates to 6 beta-lactam antibacterial agents were also determined. as a result, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) was identified in 94 out of 172 cases (54.7%) and were the most prevalent. corynebacterium spp., gram-negative bacteria and staphylococcus aureus were found in 52 (30.2%), 49 (28.5%) and 43 (25.0%) cases, respectively. four species of streptococcus family (s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis and s. bovis) were identified in a total of 58 cases (33.7%). susceptibility testing of cns to cefoperazone (cpz), cefazolin (cez), benzylpenicillin (pcg), ampicillin (abpc), methicillin (dmppc) and cloxacillin (mcipc) showed that all mic80's (inhibiting bacterial growth of 80% of all isolates) were within a range from 0.10 to 3.13 micrograms/ml and that there was no marked differences in antibacterial effects among the antibiotics used. the highest antibacterial effect on s. aureus was exhibited by mcipc, which inhibited the growth of all isolates at 0.39 microgram/ml. the mics of dmppc against all isolates of s. aureus were 3.13 micrograms/ml or less and no methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was detected. there was no difference in antibacterial activities against streptococcus family between penicillin antibiotics (dmppc, mcipc, abpc and pcg) and cephem antibiotics (cpz and cez), both of which showed excellent antibacterial activities. cephem antibiotics exhibited higher activities against gram-negative bacteria than penicillin antibiotics. especially cpz, the third generation cephem, showed excellent antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., as well as against other enterobacteriaceae.
growth responses of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae to corynebacterium bovis metabolites.
staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae growth responses to metabolites of corynebacterium bovis cultured in media containing polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate, monooleate, or trioleate and milk were determined. filter sterilized metabolites of 48-h c. bovis cultures in synthetic media were added to cultures of staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae. staphylococcus aureus and strep. agalactiae were inoculated into 12-h c. bovis milk cultures. growth responses of staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were not affected by c. bovis metabolites of synthetic media. staphylococcus aureus growth was inhibited during logarithmic and stationary phases in milk containing mixed cultures of c. bovis compared with growth in pure staph. aureus cultures. streptococcus agalactiae growth curves were similar in pure and c. bovis mixed cultures. fatty acid compositions were not different in sterile milk and milk containing bacterial cultures. growth responses of staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were not related to concentration of c. bovis metabolites or fatty acid content of media in which c. bovis were cultured.
effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on cross walls of cocci.
cultures of staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and streptococcus bovis were incubated on membrane filters on agar containing antibiotics at one-third to one-fourth the minimal inhibitory concentration for the particular bacterial strain. s. aureus was grown in the presence of oxacillin, cephaloridine, or lincomycin. n. gonorrhoeae and s. bovis were grown in the presence of penicillin. the membranes were then incubated in drug-free agar, after which viability was determined and the cells were examined by electron microscopy. s. aureus exposed to oxacillin and cephaloridine grew into cells two to seven times larger than normal that contained thick multiple cross walls. s. aureus exposed to lincomycin grew into cells 1.5 to 2 times larger than normal, with multiple thick cross walls and periheral cell walls twice the normal thickness. n. gonorrhoeae cells exposed to penicillin were slightly larger than normal and had cross walls that were up to eight times thicker than normal. after transfer to drug-free agar, cells became smaller, and some normal organisms could be seen. s. bovis incubated in the presence of penicillin grew into filaments that contained no cross walls. two hours after the return to drug-free agar, filaments with cross walls as well as normal cells were observed. exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin did not affect the growth of the peripheral cell wall of s. aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, or s. bovis, but appeared to inhibit lysis of cross walls in s. aureus and n. gonorrhoeae and to inhibit the synthesis of cross walls in s. bovis; that is, the rates of peripheral and cross wall formation differed in their susceptibility to penicillin. these facts suggest that peripheral growth and cross wall formation in cocci are separable processes.
