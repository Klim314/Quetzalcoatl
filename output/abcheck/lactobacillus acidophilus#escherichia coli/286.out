genetic and biochemical characterization of the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  lactis bacteriophage ll-h lysin.
ll-h, a virulent phage of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
lactis, produces a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, mur, that is effective on l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, and pediococcus damnosus cell walls. in this study, the ll-h gene mur was cloned into escherichia coli, its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the enzyme produced in e. coli was purified and biochemically characterized.
mur was purified 112-fold by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography.
the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity was found to be associated with a 34-kda protein.
the c-terminal domain of mur is not essential for catalytic activity since it can be removed without destroying the lytic activity.
the n-terminal sequence of the purified lysin was identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the first methionine is absent from the mature protein.
the n-terminal part of this 297-amino-acid protein had homology with several chalaropsis-type lysozymes.
reduction of purified and mur-digested l. delbrueckii cell wall material with labeled nab3h4 indicated that the enzyme is a muramidase.
the temperature optimum of purified mur is between 30 and 40 degrees c, and the ph optimum is around 5.0.
the ll-h lysin mur is stable at temperatures below 60 degrees c.
