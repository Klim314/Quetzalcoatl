TI  == corynebacterium prosthetic joint infection.
AB  == identification of corynebacterium species may be challenging. corynebacterium species are occasional causes of prosthetic joint infection (pji), but few data are available on the subject. based on the literature, c. amycolatum, c. aurimucosum, c. jeikeium, and c. striatum are the most common corynebacterium species that cause pji. we designed a rapid pcr assay to detect the most common human corynebacterium species, with a specific focus on pji. a polyphosphate kinase gene identified using whole-genome sequence was targeted. the assay differentiates the antibiotic-resistant species c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum from other species in a single assay. the assay was applied to a collection of human corynebacterium isolates from multiple clinical sources, and clinically relevant species were detected. the assay was then tested on corynebacterium isolates specifically associated with pji; all were detected. we also describe the first case of c. simulans pji.

TI  == [wound infections due to opportunistic corynebacterium species].
AB  == wound infections are often due to endogenous bacterial flora which penetrates into a site of injury. the establishment of the etiologic agent can be problematic, especially when opportunistic bacteria are present, suggesting contamination of clinical material. among bacteria that can cause such diagnostic problems are opportunistic corynebacterium spp. and coryneforms colonizing skin.  the aim of the study was to analyze the 24 clinical samples collected from wounds of different location, with gram positive rods isolated in numbers suggesting the cause of infection. bacterial identification was performed by api coryne and additional biochemical tests (api zym, api ne). it was detected that the commonest species isolated were: c. amycolatum (29.2%), c. striatum (16.7%), c. group g (16.7%) and brevibacterium spp., c. jeikeium, c. urealyticum, c. group f1. the drug susceptibility testing was performed by e-test method. among isolated strains, 83.3% were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. in 75% cases resistance to co-trimoxazole was noted, in 71.7% resistance to chloramphenicol and in 16.7% resistance to beta-lactams were detected. in presented study the high percentage of strains resistant to macrolids and linkosamids (mlsb) was noted. all strains were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == high frequency of macrolide resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of corynebacterium species.
AB  == the genus corynebacterium includes a high number of species that are usually isolated from human skin as saprophytes. however, these microorganisms have also  been reported as infectious agents in a broad group of patients and have showed broad-spectrum resistance. we studied the susceptibility profiles against macrolides, clindamycin, and streptogramins of 254 clinical strains belonging to  the species corynebacterium urealyticum (120), corynebacterium amycolatum (66), corynebacterium jeikeium (17), corynebacterium striatum (20), corynebacterium coyleae (12), corynebacterium aurimucosum (11), and corynebacterium afermentans subsp. afermentans (8). the mls(b) phenotype was detected in 186 strains and was  associated with the presence of methylase enzymes codified by the erm(x) gene in  171 strains. the erm(b) gene was only detected in two c. urealyticum strains. fourteen strains showed macrolide resistance, but they did not carry erm genes. mef genes were not detected despite eight c. amycolatum strains showed the m phenotype. also, the presence of hydrolytic enzymes codified by ere(b) was evaluated, but all results were negative. resistance to macrolide in corynebacterium sp. is mainly due to the presence of erm(x) methylase, although other resistance mechanisms could be involved.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria isolated from the reproductive tract of women].
AB  == the species composition, antilysozyme activity and antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria, isolated from the reproductive tract of women with microecological disturbances, were studied. sixty six women without microecological disturbances and 102 female patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract were examined. the study showed that corynebacterium minutissimum, c. amycolatum, c. group jk, c. bovis and c. pseudodiphtheriticum prevailed in the healthy women. in the patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract c. vitarumen, c. matruchotii, c. striatum, c. renale and c. urealyticum were detected in addition  to the above species. the average antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria isolated from the healthy women was 1.32 +/- 0.47. in the patients with  microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract it was 1.84 +/- 0.38. the  in vitro susceptibility of the coryneform bacteria to antimicrobial agents was determined. high prevalence of resistance to beta-lactams (oxacillin and penicillin), erythromycin and co-trimoxazole was detected. thus, the species variety and the antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria in the reproductive tract of the women with microecological disturbances were found to be higher. the high prevalence of resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole in the coryneform bacteria isolated from the patients with the microecological disturbances did not differ from that in the healthy women.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and 10 other antimicrobials against clinical isolates of the genus corynebacterium.
AB  == we studied the in vitro activity of tigecycline and 10 other commonly used antibiotics against 135 clinical isolates of non-diphtheria corynebacterium spp.  using the etest system. tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms (mic(50) and mic(90) values, respectively, in mg/l) were: corynebacterium urealyticum, 0.094 and 0.125; corynebacterium amycolatum, 0.125 and 2; corynebacterium jeikeium, 0.094 and 0.75; corynebacterium coyleae, 0.064 and 0.064; corynebacterium striatum, 0.064 and 1; corynebacterium aurimucosum, 0.094 and 0.125; and corynebacterium afermentans, 0.064 and 0.094. the activities of all other antimicrobials were variable, with good activity of glycopeptides, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin and with resistance to macrolides in a high number of isolates. tigecycline is a good alternative for the therapy of infections caused by non-diphtheria corynebacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid and 12 other antimicrobials against coryneform bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to compare the in vitro activity of linezolid with 12 other antimicrobials against 190 strains of the coryneform bacteria, including 60 strains of c. amycolatum, 30 of c. striatum, 30 of c. jeikeium, 10 of c. urealyticum, 20 of b. casei, 20 of d. hominis and 20 of t. otitidis. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and time-death curves were carried out according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). results: linezolid was very active against the 130 strains of the corynebacterium species studied. only the glycopeptides showed similar efficacy. in contrast, penicillin g, ampicillin, macrolides, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides showed generally high mics. among the beta-lactams, only imipenem was active against the majority of strains of c. striatum and c. amycolatum, and, approximately half of the c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum isolates. both dermabacter hominis and brevibacterium casei showed marked resistance against most of the antimicrobials tested, while turicella otitidis only showed high mics against macrolides and clindamycin. for all of them, linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin proved effective. the time-death curves showed linezolid to behave as a bacteriostatic agent (approximately 90% death rate). such activity was more accentuated for c. amycolatum and c. striatum (reduction of 1.3 and 1.7log(10)cfu/ml, respectively) than for c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum (reduction of 1.0 and 0.8log(10), respectively). conclusions: our results indicate that linezolid is active against coryneform bacteria. the efficacy of linezolid is equal to or even superior to that of the glycopeptides.

TI  == [evaluation of api coryne system, version 2.0, for diphteroid gram-positive rods  identification with clinical relevance].
AB  == the ability of the api coryne system, version 2.0, to identify 178 strains of gram-positive rods was evaluated. seventy eight isolates belonged to genus corynebacterium and one hundred to related genera, all strains were isolated from clinical samples at the laboratory of bacteriology, hospital de clinicas jose de  san martin (uba) between 1995 and 2004. the isolates were identified according to von graevenitz and funke's scheme. one hundred and sixty two out of 178 strains (91%) were correctly identified at genus and species level (ic95 = 85.6-94.6), in 44 of them (24.7%) additional tests were needed to final identification. sixteen  strains (9%) were not correctly identified (ic95 = 5.4-14.4); none of the 178 strains remained unidentified. the api coryne system, version 2.0, is useful to identify the majority of cory-nebacterium species with clinical relevance: corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium urealyticum, corynebacterium striatum,  corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, corynebacterium amycolatum and related species such as arcanobacterium haemolyticum, dermabacter hominis, listeria monocytogenes, among others. nevertheless for yellow-pigmented diphteroid gram-positive rods (aureobacterium spp., leifsonia aquatica, microbacterium spp.  and cellulomonas spp.) and for acid fast gram-positive rods (rhodococcus, gordonia, tsukamurella and nocardia) the identification usefulness the system is  limited.

TI  == corynebacterium suicordis sp. nov., from pigs.
AB  == nineteen strains of gram-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria isolated from pigs were characterized by using biochemical, molecular chemical and molecular genetic methods. two distinct groups of organisms were discerned, based on their colonial morphology, camp (christie-atkins-munch-petersen) reaction and numerical profile by using the api  coryne system. the first group (13 strains) gave a doubtful discrimination between corynebacterium striatum and corynebacterium amycolatum, whilst the second group (six strains) were identified tentatively as corynebacterium urealyticum. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies demonstrated that all of the isolates belonged phylogenetically to the genus corynebacterium: the first group of organisms was highly similar to corynebacterium testudinoris with respect to 16s rrna gene sequences and physiological characteristics, whereas the remaining six isolates formed a hitherto unknown subline within the genus, associated with a small subcluster of species that included corynebacterium auriscanis and its close relatives. the unknown corynebacterium sp. was distinguished readily from these and other species of the genus by biochemical tests. based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the new isolates from pigs should be classified as a novel species, corynebacterium suicordis sp. nov. the type strain is p81/02(t) (=cect 5724(t)=ccug 46963(t)).

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin and five other antimicrobial agents against listeria monocytogenes and coryneform bacteria isolated from clinical samples.
AB  == the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, doxycycline,  gentamicin, and vancomycin were evaluated against 15 listeria monocytogenes strains and 205 coryneform bacteria isolated from clinical samples. the percentages of strains inhibited by gemifloxacin at 0.5 microg/ml were 100% (l. monocytogenes), 93.3% (brevibacterium spp.), 90% (corynebacterium minutissimum),  42.5% (corynebacterium amycolatum), 20% (corynebacterium striatum), 12.5% (corynebacterium jeikeium), and 10% (corynebacterium urealyticum). one hundred percent of the l. monocytogenes strains were inhibited by 0.25 microg of gemifloxacin per ml, whereas 0% of the strains were inhibited by 0.25 microg of ciprofloxacin per ml. vancomycin at 2 microg/ml inhibited all strains. doxycycline and gentamicin at 4 microg/ml inhibited 94 and 49% of the strains, respectively, while ampicillin at 0.5, 2, and 8 microg/ml inhibited 24, 61, and 66% of the strains, respectively. it is concluded that gemifloxacin shows good in vitro activity against l. monocytogenes and coryneform bacteria except c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum.

TI  == evidence of increased carriage of corynebacterium spp. in healthy individuals with low antibody titres against diphtheria toxoid.
AB  == this study evaluated whether a correlation exists between carriage of corynebacteria and the lack of immunity to diphtheria toxoid. samples of both nasal and pharyngeal secretions were taken from 500 apparently healthy subjects of both sexes and of all ages and inoculated onto tinsdale's medium. a serum sample was also taken for elisa test to determine the titre of diphtheria toxin antibodies. none of the subjects carried corynebacterium diphtheriae. ninety-three strains of corynebacterium spp. were isolated from 93 subjects and 86 of these were classified to species or group level by biochemical tests. c. xerosis was the most common (25.8%) followed by c. pseudodiphthericum (16.1%), c. jeikeium and c. striatum (both 10.8%), and c. urealyticum (9.7%). three other species accounted for approximately 20% of strains and seven were unclassified as biochemically atypical corynebacteria. non-protective antibodies to diphtheria toxin were found in 80 of the 93 subjects and a strong statistical association was demonstrated between carriage of corynebacteria and non-protective levels of  anti-toxin antibodies. the remaining 13 subjects had protective levels of antitoxin antibodies. in contrast, only 45 of the 407 non-colonized subjects had  non-protective antitoxin titres. the prevalence of carriage increased with age among males as did the percentage of non-protected subjects. the prevalence of female carriers of corynebacteria was significantly lower. serum samples from 12  subjects with different antibody titres to diphtheria toxoid reacted to varying degrees with whole-cell lysates of a number of species of corynebacteria. the results suggest that a causal relationship may exist between nasopharyngeal carriage of corynebacteria and a low anti-diphtheria toxin immune response.

TI  == in-vitro activity of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and d-ofloxacin against coryneform bacteria and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the in-vitro activity of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and d-ofloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin  and sparfloxacin against coryneform bacteria and listeria monocytogenes isolated  from clinical samples. the following organisms (and number of strains) were studied: corynebacterium jeikeium (20), corynebacterium urealyticum (20), corynebacterium minutissimum (20), corynebacterium striatum (20), corynebacterium amycolatum (30), brevibacterium spp. (15) and listeria monocytogenes (15). antimicrobial activity was determined by microdilution using cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth supplemented with 0.5% tween 80 when testing c. jeikeium or  c. urealyticum. fluoroquinolones were used in the range 0.015-16 mg/l. plates were incubated in air at 35 degrees c for 18-20 h (24 h when testing c. jeikeium  or c. urealyticum). the following mic50 values were obtained for all 140 organisms tested: levofloxacin, 1 mg/l; ofloxacin, 2 mg/l; d-ofloxacin, > 16 mg/l; ciprofloxacin, 1 mg/l; norfloxacin, 16 mg/l; sparfloxacin, 1 mg/l. mic90 values were > 16 mg/l for all test antibiotics with the exception of levofloxacin, which had an mic90 value of 16 mg/l. at a concentration of 2 mg/l,  levofloxacin inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains and 35-93% of the remaining species. mic90 values of ofloxacin were one dilution step higher than those of levofloxacin against c. minutissimum, c. striatum, brevibacterium spp. and l. monocytogenes. levofloxacin showed similar (c. jeikeium, c. urealyticum, c. amycolatum and brevibacterium spp.) or greater (c. minutissimum and c. striatum)  activity than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, and higher than d-ofloxacin or norfloxacin against all species studied. in conclusion, levofloxacin was the most active of the six fluoroquinolones evaluated against coryneform bacteria isolated from clinical samples and could therefore be a promising treatment option in this setting.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of aerobic and facultative non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli to hmr 3647 (ru 66647) and 14 other antimicrobials.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of the ketolide hmr 3647 (ru 66647) and those of structurally related macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin compounds (erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, josamycin, lincomycin, pristinamycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin) as well as those of benzylpenicillin, doxycycline, vancomycin, teicoplanin, levofloxacin, and rifapentine against 247 aerobic and facultative non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli were determined by an agar dilution method. the ketolide was active against most organisms tested except corynebacterium striatum, coryneform cdc group 12, and oerskovia spp. the frequency of resistance to erythromycin and other macrolides as well as that to lincomycin was high. pristinamycin and, to a  lesser extent, quinupristin-dalfopristin were very active, but resistance to these agents was present in some strains of rhodococcus equi, listeria spp., c. striatum, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and oerskovia spp. hmr 3647 was very active against all erythromycin-sensitive and many erythromycin-nonsusceptible strains, especially corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium jeikeium. in vitro resistance to benzylpenicillin was common, but doxycycline, vancomycin,  and teicoplanin were very active against most organisms tested except e. rhusiopathiae, against which glycopeptide antibiotics were not active. the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was remarkable, but resistance to this agent was common for c. amycolatum, corynebacterium urealyticum, c. jeikeium, and oerskovia spp. strains. rifapentine was also very active in vitro against many organisms, but resistance to this agent was always present in e. rhusiopathiae and was very  common in c. striatum and c. urealyticum.

TI  == prospective study of catalase-positive coryneform organisms in clinical specimens: identification, clinical relevance, and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == during a 6-month period, all clinical isolates of catalase-positive coryneform organisms, which were isolated during the routine processing of clinical specimens, were characterized in the laboratory of the 1800-bed university hospital of leuven. the distribution of the species in the corynebacteria was: corynebacterium amycolatum 70 (53%), corynebacterium jeikeium 16 (12%), corynebacterium striatum 11 (8%), corynebacterium afermentans 10 (7%), corynebacterium minutissimum 9 (6%), cdc coryneform group g 4 (3%), corynebacterium urealyticum 4 (3%), corynebacterium glucuronolyticum 1 (0.7%), and corynebacterium xerosis 1 (0.7%). of the 150 isolates, 37 (25%) were considered to be infection related and the remaining 113 (75%) were of questionable clinical significance. susceptibility of the corynebacteria to 12 antibiotics active against gram-positive organisms was evaluated. c. amycolatum,  c. jeikeium, and c. urealyticum were multiresistant, but all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin and vancomycin. most of the c. amycolatum strains, and all strains of c. jeikeium and c. striatum, were susceptible to the vibrocidal compound o/129.

TI  == species identities and antimicrobial susceptibilities of corynebacteria isolated  from various clinical sources.
AB  == over a 14-month period, 415 clinical isolates of coryneform gram-positive rods were recovered from various sources and identified to the species level according to recent identification schemes. corynebacterium urealyticum, corynebacterium striatum, corynebacterium amycolatum, and corynebacterium jeikeium predominated,  accounting for 63% of all isolates. corynebacterium accolens, corynebacterium striatum, corynebacterium argentoratense, corynebacterium propinquum and corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum were mostly recovered from the respiratory tract, whereas corynebacterium afermentans, cdc group g, and corynebacterium jeikeium were mainly isolated from blood. none of the isolates was identified as  corynebacterium diphtheriae or corynebacterium xerosis. ampicillin resistance was detected in corynebacterium jeikeium (96%) and corynebacterium urealyticum (99%)  and varied among corynebacterium amycolatum (56%) and cdc group g (26%). these data emphasize the need for an accurate identification of coryneform organisms at the species level and for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of these organisms.

TI  == evaluation of the applicability of amplified rdna-restriction analysis (ardra) to identification of species of the genus corynebacterium.
AB  == the 16s rrna genes (rdna) of 50 strains belonging to 26 different coryneform bacterial species and genomospecies and of the type strain of rhodococcus equi were enzymatically amplified. amplified rdna restriction analysis (ardra) with the enzymes alui, cfoi and rsai was carried out. the combination of the ardra patterns obtained after restriction with these three different enzymes enabled the differentiation between the following species: corynebacterium accolens (number of strains = 2), c. afermentans subsp. afermentans (2), c. afermentans subsp. lipophilum (2), c. amycolatum (3), cdc coryneform group anf-1-like (1), cdc coryneform group anf-3-like (1), c. cystitidis (1), c. diphtheriae (4), c. jeikeium (3), c. macginleyi (2), c. minutissimum (1), c. pilosum (1), c. pseudotuberculosis (2), c. renale (2), c. striatum (2), c. urealyticum (3), c. xerosis (1), cdc coryneform groups b-1 (2), b-3 (2), f-1, genomospecies 1 and 2 (6), g, genomospecies 1 (1) and g, genomospecies 2 (2). the following strains or  species could not be differentiated from each other: c. pseudodiphtheriticum (2)  from c. propinquum (former cdc coryneform group anf-3) (2), cdc coryneform group  f-1, genomospecies 1 (4) from genomospecies 2 (2) and c. jeikeium genomospecies a (1) from genomospecies c (2). ardra may represent a possible alternative for identification of coryneforms, since this technique enabled the identification of most coryneforms tested and since dna extraction (i.e. cell lysis by boiling), amplification, restriction and electrophoresis can be carried out within 8 hours. this might allow quick identification of c. diphtheriae and other possible pathogens of the genus corynebacterium.
