TI  - Performance evaluation and bacteria analysis of AFB-MFC enriched with high-strength synthetic wastewater.
AB  - In order to study the performance and bacterial communities of an anaerobic fluidized bed microbial fuel cell (AFB-MFC) system, the 16S rDNA gene sequencing was applied, and high-strength synthetic wastewater was treated by the AFB-MFC system. The high-strength synthetic wastewater, in which the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were above 19,000, 2,516-3,871 and 927-1,427 mg/L, was treated by the AFB-MFC system. The removal efficiency of COD, nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen reached 70-89, 98 and 98%, while the maximum voltage was 394 mV. The bacteria analysis revealed the presence of Alistipes putredinis, Carnobacterium sp., Victivallis vadensis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Thauera sp., Parabacteroides merdae, Parvimonas micra, Parabacteroides sp., and Desulfomicrobium baculatum in the anode chamber. In addition, the Klebsiella pneumoniae was observed to have the capability of organic degradation and electricity generation, while the Thauera sp. has the capability of denitrification.
TI  - Parabacteroides chinchillae sp. nov., isolated from chinchilla (Chincilla lanigera) faeces.
AB  - Strains of Gram-stain-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria were isolated from chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) faeces, and strain ST166(T) was investigated taxonomically. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain ST166(T) belonged to the genus Parabacteroides. Strain ST166(T) formed a distinct line of descent, and the highest sequence similarity to ST166(T) was found with Parabacteroides merdae JCM 9497(T) (95.6%) and Parabacteroides johnsonii JCM 13406(T) (95.0%). Analysis of hsp60 gene sequences also supported these relationships. Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the novel species Parabacteroides chinchillae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of P. chinchillae sp. nov. is ST166(T) ( = JCM 17104(T) =CCUG 62154(T)).
TI  - Parabacteroides chartae sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic species from wastewater of a paper mill.
AB  - A bacterial strain, designated NS31-3(T), was isolated from the wastewater of a paper mill. Cells of the isolate were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-motile, Gram-negative, short rods (0.7-1.0 x 1.4-2.5 microm). The isolate was able to grow on media containing 20% bile salts. API 20A tests showed that acid was produced from glucose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, cellobiose, D-mannose, D-melezitose, D-raffinose, D-trehalose, D-mannitol, salicin and D-sorbitol. The main fermentation products from PYG broth were lactic acid, propionic acid, formic acid and acetic acid. Chemotaxonomic analysis showed that the major fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), C(15:0) and iso-C(17:0) 3-OH and the predominant respiratory quinones were MK-9 and MK-10. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain NS31-3(T) was related to members of genus Parabacteroides (91.2-93.2% sequence similarity); the isolate had the closest affinity with Parabacteroides merdae JCM 9497(T). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 37.2 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, strain NS31-3(T) represents a novel species of the genus Parabacteroides, for which the name Parabacteroides chartae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NS31-3(T) (=JCM 17797(T) =DSM 24967(T)).
TI  - Macellibacteroides fermentans gen. nov., sp. nov., a member of the family Porphyromonadaceae isolated from an upflow anaerobic filter treating abattoir wastewaters.
AB  - A novel obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped mesophilic bacterium, which stained Gram-positive but showed the typical cell wall structure of Gram-negative bacteria, was isolated from an upflow anaerobic filter treating abattoir wastewaters in Tunisia. The strain, designated LIND7H(T), grew at 20-45 degrees C (optimum 35-40 degrees C) and at pH 5.0-8.5 (optimum pH 6.5-7.5). It did not require NaCl for growth, but was able to grow in the presence of up to 2 % NaCl. Sulfate, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, sulfite, nitrate and nitrite were not used as terminal electron acceptors. Strain LIND7H(T) used cellobiose, glucose, lactose, mannose, maltose, peptone, rhamnose, raffinose, sucrose and xylose as electron donors. The main fermentation products from glucose metabolism were lactate, acetate, butyrate and isobutyrate. The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), C(15 : 0), C(17 : 0) 2-OH and a summed feature consisting of C(18 : 2)omega6,9c and/or anteiso-C(18 : 0), and the major menaquinones were MK-9, MK-9(H(2)) and MK-10. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 41.4 mol%. Although the closest phylogenetic relatives of strain LIND7H(T) were Parabacteroides merdae, Parabacteroides goldsteinii and Parabacteroides gordonii, analysis of the hsp60 gene sequence showed that strain LIND7H(T) was not a member of the genus Parabacteroides. On the basis of phylogenetic inference and phenotypic properties, strain LIND7H(T) ( = CCUG 60892(T) = DSM 23697(T) = JCM 16313(T)) is proposed as the type strain of a novel species in a new genus within the family Porphyromonadaceae, Macellibacteroides fermentans gen. nov., sp. nov.
TI  - Parabacteroides johnsonii sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - A bacterial strain isolated from human faeces, M-165T, was characterized in terms of its phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profile, menaquinone profile and phylogenetic position (based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis). A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the isolate was a member of the genus Parabacteroides. Strain M-165T was closely related to Parabacteroides merdae strains, showing 98 % sequence similarity. The strain was obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, Gram-negative, rod-shaped and was able to grow on media containing 20 % bile. Although the phenotypic characteristics of the strain M-165T were similar to those of P. merdae, the isolate could be differentiated from P. merdae by means of API 20A tests for L-arabinose and L-rhamnose fermentation. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinctiveness of the novel strain with respect to P. merdae JCM 9497T (<or=60 % DNA-DNA relatedness). The DNA G+C content of the strain is 47.6 mol%. On the basis of these data, strain M-165T represents a novel species of the genus Parabacteroides, for which the name Parabacteroides johnsonii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is M-165T (=JCM 13406T=DSM 18315T).
