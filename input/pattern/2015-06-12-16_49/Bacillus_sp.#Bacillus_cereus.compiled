TI  - Research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  - The biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. This method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. The main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. Tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. This purifier is called biofilter. The biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. In order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. Pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. According to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. When acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. The species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. Bacillus (B. cereus, B. subtilis), Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa, P. putida), Stapylococcus (S. aureus) and Rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. Their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 CFU g-1.
TI  - Diversity of foodborne bacillus volatile compounds and influence on fungal growth.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antifungal activity of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by 75 different foodborne Bacillus species against Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, A. clavatus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae, and Moniliophthora perniciosa and to determine the VOCs responsible for the inhibition. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacillus strains inhibited fungal growth, although with different inhibition grades, with B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. cereus strains as the best antifungal VOCs producers. While M. perniciosa DM4B and F. oxysporum f.sp. lactucae MA28 were the most sensitive fungi, A. parasiticus MG51 showed the greatest resistance to Bacillus VOCs exposure. Thirty-seven compounds were detected by SPME-GC-MS analysis, although similar patterns in volatile compounds were evidenced within the species, interspecific VOCs differences determined different effects on fungal growth. Multiple partial least regression (MPLRS) and antifungal activity of the individual VOCs revealed that only propanone, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, carbon disulfide, 3-methylbutanoic acid and ethyl acetate were responsible for mycelia inhibition of M. perniciosa DM4B and F. oxysporum f.sp. lactucae MA28. CONCLUSIONS: The antagonistic activity of the Bacillus VOCs was demonstrated, although it cannot easily be explained through the action of a single molecule, thus a holistic approach could be more appropriate to estimate the fungal growth inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: VOCs produced by Bacillus from cooked food can be considered as promising antifungal compounds useful in the control of fungal plant pathogens. This study investigates for the first time the correlation between mycelia inhibition of M. perniciosa and F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae and the VOCs emitted by the Bacillus species.

TI  - Isolation of lactic acid bacteria showing anti-oxidative and probiotic activities from kimchi and infant feces.
AB  - The purpose of this study aimed to investigate the lactic acid bacteria with anti-oxidative and probiotic activities isolated from Korean healthy infant feces and kimchi. A1, A2, S1, S2, and S3 isolates were assigned to Lactobacillus sp. A3, A4, E1, E2, E3, and E4 isolates were assigned to Leuconostoc sp. on the basis of their physiological properties and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. Most strains were confirmed as safe bio resources through non-hemolytic activities and non-production of harmful enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and tryptophanase etc. Isolated 11 strains showed different resistant to acid and bile acids. In addition, 11 strains exhibited antibacterial activity against food-borne bacteria, especially Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, all strains showed the highest levels of hydrophobicity. The antioxidant effects of 11 strains culture filtrate include 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity, 2.2'-azino-bis (2-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation scavenging activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The results revealed that most strains culture filtrate have effectively scavenging activity at DPPH and ABTS radicals. All strains appeared effectively superoxide dismutase activity. In conclusion, isolated strains A1, A3, S1, and S3 have good probiotic activities applicable to the development for functional foods and health-related products. Also these might be contributed to prevent and control several disease associated with oxidative stress using as probiotics.
TI  - Production, optimization and characterization of polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic by Bacillus spp.
AB  - Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the intracellular lipid reserve accumulated by many bacteria. The most potent terrestrial bacterium Bacillus cereus SE-1 showed more PHB accumulating cells (22.1 and 40% after 48 and 72 h) than that of the marine Bacillus sp. CS-605 (5 and 33% after 48 and 72 h). Both the isolates harbored phbB gene and the characteristics C=O peak was observed in the extracted PHB by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy analysis. Maltose was found to be the most suitable carbon source for the accumulation of PHB in B. cereus SE-1. The extracted PHB sample from B. cereus SE-1 was blended with a thermoplastic starch (TS) and an increased thermoplasticity and decreased crystallinity were observed after blending in comparison to the standard PHB. The melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy (Hf), and crystallinity (Xc) of the blended PHB sample were found to be 109.4 degrees C, 64.58 J/g, and 44.23%, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus Bipolaris tetramera.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. Myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. In the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus B. tetramera KF934408 from rhizospheric soil. This phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. RESULTS: Silver (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopic analysis. The formulated AgNPs were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas AuNPs were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. The nanoparticles were assessed for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. The results showed effective antimicrobial activity of AgNPs against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aeroginosa and Trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, AuNPs possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on J774 and THP1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of AgNPs, while AuNPs were non-toxic at both low and high doses. Furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ROS was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. The capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus B. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.
TI  - Biodegradation of carbofuran in soils within Nzoia River Basin, Kenya.
AB  - Carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethylbenzofuran-7-yl methylcarbamate) has been used within the Nzoia River Basin (NRB), especially in Bunyala Rice Irrigation Schemes, in Kenya for the control of pests. In this study, the capacity of native bacteria to degrade carbofuran in soils from NRB was investigated. A gram positive, rod-shaped bacteria capable of degrading carbofuran was isolated through liquid cultures with carbofuran as the only carbon and nitrogen source. The isolate degraded 98% of 100-mug mL(-1) carbofuran within 10 days with the formation of carbofuran phenol as the only detectable metabolite. The degradation of carbofuran was followed by measuring its residues in liquid cultures using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Physical and morphological characteristics as well as molecular characterization confirmed the bacterial isolate to be a member of Bacillus species. The results indicate that this strain of Bacillus sp. could be considered as Bacillus cereus or Bacillus thuringiensis with a bootstrap value of 100% similar to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. The biodegradation capability of the native strains in this study indicates that they have great potential for application in bioremediation of carbofuran-contaminated soil sites.
TI  - A rapid and miniaturized method for the selection of microbial phenol degraders using colourimetric microtitration.
AB  - A high-throughput method is described, consisting of a colourimetric microtitration for screening phenol-degrading microorganisms, using a mixture of 4-aminoantipyrine and potassium ferricyanide as the colour indicator. This contemporary study summarizes a new method to determine phenol-degrading bacteria isolated from different areas. The method was used for testing a total of 72 bacteria collected from the natural environment and five known strains obtained from diagnostic and research laboratories employing 200 mg/L phenol (the linear range saturation concentration). Depending on the change in colour indicator, the degradation profiles of 11 strains of bacteria are shown, of which seven strains were able to degrade more than 80 % of phenol within 6-8 h, while the other four strains took 12-24 h. Two of the environmentally isolated strains showed high efficiency of phenol degradation and were confirmed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. These strains were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as unique (Escherichia coli moh1 and Bacillus cereus moh2) and were deposited in the GenBank of NCBI. Two pathogenic strains (Uropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella sp.) were found to be the fast degraders of phenol, which is of medical concern, as phenol is generally used as a disinfectant in hospitals. This method can be used for the estimation and screening of phenol degraders in a single step, for its application in bioremediation as well as in hospitals for screening the phenol resistance of pathogens.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis CBMDC3f with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria: UV-MALDI-TOF MS analysis of its bioactive compounds.
AB  - In this work a new Bacillus sp. strain, isolated from honey, was characterized phylogenetically. Its antibacterial activity against three relevant foodborne pathogenic bacteria was studied; the main bioactive metabolites were analyzed using ultraviolet matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (UV-MALDI MS). Bacillus CBMDC3f was phylogenetically characterized as Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis after rRNA analysis of the 16S subunit and the gyrA gene (access codes Genbank JX120508 and JX120516, respectively). Its antibacterial potential was evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes (9 strains), B. cereus (3 strains) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213. Its cell suspension and cell-free supernatant (CFS) exerted significant anti-Listeria and anti-S. aureus activities, while the lipopeptides fraction (LF) also showed anti-B. cereus effect. The UV-MALDI-MS analysis revealed surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the CFS, whereas surfactin predominated in the LF. The CFS from CBMDC3f contained surfactin, iturin and fengycin with four, two and four homologues per family, respectively, whereas four surfactin, one iturin and one fengycin homologues were identified in the LF. For some surfactin homologues, their UV-MALDI-TOF/TOF (MS/MS; Laser Induced Decomposition method, LID) spectra were also obtained. Mass spectrometry analysis contributed with relevant information about the type of lipopeptides that Bacillus strains can synthesize. From our results, surfactin would be the main metabolite responsible for the antibacterial effect.
TI  - Structure, Activity and Stereoselectivity of NADPH-Dependent Oxidoreductases Catalysing the S-Selective Reduction of the Imine Substrate 2-Methylpyrroline.
AB  - Oxidoreductases from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 [3546-IRED], Bacillus cereus BAG3X2  (BcIRED) and Nocardiopsis halophila (NhIRED) each reduce prochiral 2-methylpyrroline (2MPN) to (S)-2-methylpyrrolidine with >95 % ee and also a number of other imine substrates with good selectivity. Structures of BcIRED and NhIRED have helped to identify conserved active site residues within this subgroup of imine reductases that have S selectivity towards 2MPN, including a tyrosine residue that has a possible role in catalysis and superimposes with an aspartate in related enzymes that display R selectivity towards the same substrate. Mutation of this tyrosine residue-Tyr169-in 3546-IRED to Phe resulted in a mutant of negligible activity. The data together provide structural evidence for the location and significance of the Tyr residue in this group of imine reductases, and permit a comparison of the active sites of enzymes that reduce 2MPN with either R or S selectivity.
TI  - MALDI-TOF MS and CD spectral analysis for identification and structure prediction of a purified, novel, organic solvent stable, fibrinolytic metalloprotease from Bacillus cereus B80.
AB  - The ability to predict protein function from structure is becoming increasingly important; hence, elucidation and determination of protein structure become the major steps in proteomics. The present study was undertaken for identification of metalloprotease produced by Bacillus cereus B80 and recognition of characteristics that can be industrially exploited. The enzyme was purified in three steps combining precipitation and chromatographic methods resulting in 33.5% recovery with 13.1-fold purification of enzyme which was detected as a single band with a molecular mass of 26 kDa approximately in SDS-PAGE and zymogram. The MALDI-TOF MS showed that the enzyme exhibited 70-93% similarity with zinc metalloproteases from various strains Bacillus sp. specifically from Bacillus cereus group. The sequence alignment revealed the presence of zinc-binding region VVVHEMCHMV in the most conserved C terminus region. Secondary structure of the enzyme was obtained by CD spectra and I-TASSER. The enzyme kinetics revealed a Michaelis constant (Km) of 0.140 mumol/ml and Vmax of 2.11 mumol/min. The application studies showed that the enzyme was able to hydrolyze various proteins with highest affinity towards casein followed by BSA and gelatin. The enzyme exhibited strong fibrinolytic, collagenolytic, and gelatinolytic properties and stability in various organic solvents.
TI  - [Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra Oaxaca, Mexico].
AB  - Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra  Oaxaca, Mexico. Bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. They have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. To contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. For this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from February to October 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. Each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees C. Bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and biochemical tests. We obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. We found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum Proteobacteria and the family Enterobacteriaceae. Statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. It was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with Bacillus cereus, B. sp. X. sp., as well as, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. Bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. These bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. By understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Purification and identification of an antibacterial protein from the symbiotic bacteria associated with novel entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp.
AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) belonging to the families steinernematidae and heterorhabditidae and their symbiotic bacteria Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are well-known as biological control agents and are found to produce a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites. Studies carried out at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) on entomopathogenic nematodes resulted in the identification of novel EPN belonging to the family Rhabditidae. This study reports the purification of a high molecular weight antibacterial protein from culture filtrates of a bacterium (Bacillus cereus) symbiotically associated with a novel entomopathogenic nematode Rhabditis (Oscheius) species, maintained at CTCRI laboratory. Fermentation conditions were standardized and optimum antibacterial activity was observed in tryptic soy broth after 48 h incubation at 30 degrees C. The aqueous extracts yielded antibacterial proteins which were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Native gel electrophoresis indicated an active protein of molecular mass 220KDa which resolved into a major band of 90 kDa and a minor band of about 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The 90 kDa protein showed antibacterial activity and was further analysed by MALDI TOF-MS/MS. The protein was identified as a TQXA (Threonine-glutamine dipeptide) domain containing protein from Bacillus cereus. The protein was found to be active against Bacillus subtilis MTCC2756, Staphylococus aureus MTCC902 and Escherichia coli MTCC 2622 and was thermally stable.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Characterization of a novel thermostable N-acylhomoserine lactonase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermaerobacter marianensis.
AB  - Thermaerobacter marianensis is an extremely thermophilic bacterium, which was isolated from the Mariana Trench, with an optimal growth temperature of approximately 75 degrees C. N-Acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) is a quorum-sensing signal molecule used by many gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report the identification of an AHL-degrading gene homolog (designated aiiT) in the genome of T. marianensis JCM 10246. AiiT has 59.7%, 21.2%, and 11.2% identity to AhlS from Solibacillus silvestris, AiiA from Bacillus cereus, and AidC from Chryseobacterium sp., respectively. Homologs of aiiT were also found in Thermaerobacter nagasakiensis, T. composti, and T. subterraneus. A purified AiiT-maltose binding fusion showed high AHL-degrading activity against N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, N-octanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, and N-decanoyl-l-homoserine lactone at temperatures ranging from 40 to 80 degrees C. HPLC analysis revealed that AiiT functions as an AHL-lactonase that catalyzes AHL ring opening by hydrolyzing lactones. AiiT displayed maximal activity at high temperatures (60-80 degrees C) and showed higher thermostability than other AHL lactonases.
TI  - A halotolerant thermostable lipase from the marine bacterium Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02 with an ability to disrupt bacterial biofilms.
AB  - A halotolerant thermostable lipase was purified and characterized from the marine bacterium Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02. This lipase displayed a high degree of stability over a wide range of conditions including pH, salinity, and temperature. It was optimally active at 30 degrees C and pH 8.0 respectively and was stable at higher temperatures (50-70 degrees C) and alkaline pH. The molecular mass of the lipase was approximately 31 kDa based on SDS-PAGE and MALDI-ToF fingerprint analysis. Conditions for enhanced production of lipase by Oceanobacillus sp. PUMB02 were attained in response surface method-guided optimization with factors such as olive oil, sucrose, potassium chromate, and NaCl being evaluated, resulting in levels of 58.84 U/ml being achieved. The biofilm disruption potential of the PUMB02 lipase was evaluated and compared with a marine sponge metagenome derived halotolerant lipase Lpc53E1. Good biofilm disruption activity was observed with both lipases against potential food pathogens such as Bacillus cereus MTCC1272, Listeria sp. MTCC1143, Serratia sp. MTCC4822, Escherichia coli MTCC443, Pseudomonas fluorescens MTCC1748, and Vibrio parahemolyticus MTCC459. Phase contrast microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed very effective disruption of pathogenic biofilms. This study reveals that marine derived hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases may have potential utility in inhibiting biofilm formation in a food processing environment and is the first report of the potential application of lipases from the genus Oceanobacillus in biofilm disruption strategies.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the Mooi River, North West province, South Africa.
AB  - Groundwater in the Mooi River catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. In this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. Bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Escherichia coli). Antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. Physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. HPC bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. E. coli were enumerated from Trimpark, School and Cemetery. The Blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. Pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. Opportunistic pathogens isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium spp. Varying patterns of antibiotic resistance were observed. Most HPC bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. Pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant ARB. Other ARBs included Alcaligenes faecalis, Ochrobactrum sp. and Achromobacter sp. ARBs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to HPCs. The presence of E. coli and ARB in these groundwater sources indicates potential human health risks. These risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.
TI  - The analysis of distribution of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas and Bacillus species from burn patients and burn ward environment.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria act as a risk factor for mortality in burns patients. So keeping in view the crucial importance of reliable therapeutic decisions of multidrug resistance bacteria and role of hospital environment in bacteria colonization, our study is based on the evaluation of distribution of Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. in burn patients and burn ward environment. METHODS: The present prospective analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the Burn ward of Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2012 to March 2013. The multidrug resistant bacteria were characterized by following the CLSI guidelines. Molecular identification isolates were done by amplifying and sequencing 16S rDNA. RESULTS: In our study out of 510 samples of 280 burn patients, 263 samples were observed sterile and bacterial isolates were obtained from 247 samples. In burn patients out of 247 samples 43 MDR strains, and in burn ward out of 60 samples 4 MDR strain were observed. After 16S rDNA amplification of MDR isolates the prevalent bacterium was belonged to the genus Bacillus (8 species; 26 isolates) followed by genus Pseudomonas (5 species; 17 isolates). The burn ward environment isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Bacillus cereus and Acinetobacter baumanii. CONCLUSION: The major finding of our study is the predominance of B. cereus followed by P. aeruginosa in burn patients of Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana. While considering the role of hospital environment, no direct role of environmental isolates was observed in transfer of bacterial infection.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.
AB  - The present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.
TI  - Plant growth promoting bacteria from cow dung based biodynamic preparations.
AB  - Indigenous formulations based on cow dung fermentation are commonly used in organic farming. Three biodynamic preparations viz., Panchagavya (PG), BD500 and 'Cow pat pit' (CPP) showed high counts of lactobacilli (10(9) ml(-1)) and yeasts (10(4) ml(-1)). Actinomycetes were present only in CPP (10(4) ml(-1)) and absent in the other two. Seven bacterial isolates from these ferments were identified by a polyphasic approach: Bacillus safensis (PG1), Bacillus cereus (PG2, PG4 PG5), Bacillus subtilis (BD2) Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus (BD3) and Bacillus licheniformis (CPP1). This is the first report of L. xylanilyticus and B. licheniformis in biodynamic preparations. Only three carbon sources-dextrose, sucrose and trehalose out of 21 tested were utilized by all the bacteria. None could utilize arabinose, dulcitol, galactose, inositol, inulin, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose and sorbitol. All the strains produced indole acetic acid (1.8-3.7 mug ml(-1) culture filtrate) and ammonia. None could fix nitrogen; but all except B. safensis and B. licheniformis could solubilize phosphorous from insoluble tri-calcium phosphate. All the strains except L. xylaniliticus exhibited antagonism to the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia bataticola whereas none could inhibit Sclerotium rolfsi. In green house experiment in soil microcosms, bacterial inoculation significantly promoted growth of maize; plant dry weight increased by ~21 % due to inoculation with B. cereus (PG2). Results provide a basis for understanding the beneficial effects of biodynamic preparations and industrial deployment of the strains.
TI  - Twenty Whole-Genome Bacillus sp. Assemblies.
AB  - Bacilli are genetically and physiologically diverse, ranging from innocuous to highly pathogenic. Here, we present annotated genome assemblies for 20 strains belonging to Bacillus anthracis, B. atrophaeus, B. cereus, B. licheniformis, B. macerans, B. megaterium, B. mycoides, and B. subtilis.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a furfural-degrading bacterium Bacillus cereus  sp. strain DS1.
AB  - Furfural was found to be the main organic pollutant in the wastewater coming from the Diosgenin factory. This substance is derived from acidic pentosan in Dioscorea zingiberensis and is also found in a variety of agricultural byproducts, including corncobs, oat, wheat bran, and sawdust. It is regarded as a toxicant and an inhibitor to the growth of microorganism in both sewage disposal and biological fermentation. A furfural-degrading strain (DS1) was isolated from activated sludge of wastewater treatment plant in a diosgenin factory by continuous enrichment culture. The strain was identified as Bacillus cereus based on morphological, physiological tests, as well as on 16S rDNA sequence and Biolog analyses. The capacity of this strain to grow on a mineral salt medium, utilizing furfural as the sole carbon and energy source to degrade furfural, was investigated in this study. Under the condition of pH 9.0, temperature 35 degrees C, with rotating speed of 150 rpm, and an inoculum of 6 %, the strain showed that the furfural degradation capacity reaches 35 % in 7 days, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The addition of inorganic carbon sources could bring down the biodegradation efficiency of the furfural. The strain DS1 showed better furfural removal capacity, as compared to other inorganic carbon sources in the media. Furthermore, a furfural concentration of as high as 4,000 mg L(-1) was tolerated by the culture. The capacity to degrade furfural was demonstrated for the first time by using the genus B. cereus. This study suggests the possible application in biodegradation strategies.
TI  - Two rhizobacterial strains, individually and in interactions with Rhizobium sp.,  enhance fusarial wilt control, growth, and yield in pigeon pea.
AB  - A Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, RRLJ 04, and a Bacillus cereus strain, BS 03, were tested both individually and in combination with a Rhizobium strain, RH 2, for their ability to enhance plant growth and nodulation in pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) under gnotobiotic, greenhouse and field conditions. Both of the rhizobacterial strains exhibited a positive effect on growth in terms of shoot height, root length, fresh and dry weight, nodulation and yield over the non-treated control. Co-inoculation of seeds with these strains and Rhizobium RH 2 also reduced the number of wilted plants, when grown in soil infested with Fusarium udum. Gnotobiotic studies confirmed that the suppression of wilt disease was due to the presence of the respective PGPR strains. Seed bacterization with drug-marked mutants of RRLJ 04 and BS 03 confirmed their ability to colonize and multiply along the roots. The results suggest that co-inoculation of these strains with Rhizobium strain RH 2 can be further exploited for enhanced growth, nodulation and yield in addition to control of fusarial wilt in pigeon pea.
TI  - Structural data and biological properties of almond gum oligosaccharide: application to beef meat preservation.
AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of almond gum generates low molecular weight oligosaccharides (OAG) with a yield of 33.5%. The generated oligosaccharides were purified and identified. OAG analyses show that the most prominent residues were galactose and arabinose with traces of xylose, rhamnose, glucose and mannose. The glycosyl linkage positions were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showing a main chain composed of galactose units [ --> 3)-Gal-(1 --> ] branched mainly with arabinose residues [Ara-(1 --> ]. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of OAG were investigated. As regards the in vitro antioxidant activities, the OAG showed a high total antioxidant activity (347 mug ascorbic acid equivalent/mL), an important DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.64 mg/mL) and a high reducing capacity (RP0.5AU = 3.6 mg/mL). Furthermore, OAG had a high antimicrobial activity against Salmonella thyphimirium, Bacillus cereus, Actinomycetes sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Alternaria alternate and Candidat albicans. Finally, OAG efficiency was tested using 0.5%; 0.75% and 1% concentrations in beef meat preservation. Microbial growth and lipid oxidation were monitored during 9 days at 4 degrees C. The results showed significant inhibitions (p < 0.05) of lipid oxidation and microbial growth in ground beef meat containing OAG.
TI  - [Effects of inoculating plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria on the biological characteristics of walnut (Juglans regia) rhizosphere soil under drought condition].
AB  - Effects of four plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) , namely Pseudomonas  sp. YT3, Bacillus subtilis DZ1, B. cereus L90 and B. fusiformis L13 on the biological characteristics of walnut (Juglans regia) rhizosphere soil under drought stress were investigated. Results showed that drought stress had little effect on available nutrients of walnut rhizosphere soil, but significantly decreased the activity of organic carbon by 18.4% and increased the pH from 7.34 to 7.79. Under drought stress condition, the inoculation of Bacillus cereus L90 significantly increased high-labile organic carbon in walnut rhizosphere by 14.5% relative to the un-inoculated control, and decreased the pH to 7.41. Compared with the irrigated control, the total microbial populations, root exudates, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen in walnut rhizosphere soil were significantly decreased by 36.0%, 20.7%, 33.5% and 30.7%, respectively, because of drought stress. However, L90 inoculation decreased these deficits to 14.1%, 10.3%, 12.1% and 12.7%, respectively. Some terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) disappeared under the drought condition and PGPR inoculation had great influence on T-RFs according to Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism profiles. The Margalef index and the Shannon index of walnut rhizosphere soil significantly decreased, but the Simpson index increased relative to the irrigated control. Compared with the un-inoculated control, the Margalef index significantly increased from 0.42 to 0.99, as well as the Shannon index increased from 0.52 to 0.98. However, the Simpson index de- creased from 0.60 to 0.39. Inoculating YT3, DZ1 and L13 had weaker effects on the biological characteristics of walnut rhizosphere soil compared to inoculating L90, suggesting L90 inoculation could interfere with the suppression of drought stress to the biological characteristics of walnut rhizosphere soil.
TI  - Cytotoxic and Antibacterial Quinone Sesquiterpenes from a Myrothecium Fungus.
AB  - Six new quinone sesquiterpenes, myrothecols A-F (1-6), and hymenopsin B (7) were  isolated from cultures of Myrothecium sp. SC0265 by bioassay-guided fractionation. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS data. The absolute configurations of the new compounds were assigned by CD/TDDFT calculations, and that of and hymenopsin B was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 1-5 and hymenopsin demonstrated cytotoxic activity against human carcinoma A549, HeLa, and HepG2 cells. Compounds 1-5 also exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Lumazine peptides penilumamides B-D and the cyclic pentapeptide asperpeptide A from a gorgonian-derived Aspergillus sp. fungus.
AB  - Three new lumazine peptides, penilumamides B-D (2-4), and one known analogue, penilumamide (1), together with a new cyclic pentapeptide, asperpeptide A (5), were isolated from the gorgonian-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. XS-20090B15. Among them, 2 was obtained from the feeding culture with l-methionine of this strain. All structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and chemical derivatization. Compounds 1-4 are rare lumazine peptides, of which 1 and 3 are formed from 2 by oxidation of the l-methionine residue.
TI  - The influence of fat and monoacylglycerols on growth of spore-forming bacteria in processed cheese.
AB  - Highly undesirable microbial contaminants of processed cheese are endospore-forming bacteria of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. Survival of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Clostridium butyricum and C. sporogenes was examined in model processed cheese samples supplemented with monoacylglycerols. In processed cheese samples, monoacylglycerols of undecanoic, undecenoic, lauric and adamantane-1-carboxylic acid at concentration of 0.15% w/w prevented the growth and multiplication of both Bacillus species throughout the storage period. The two species of Clostridium were less affected by monoacylglycerols in processed cheese samples and only partial inhibition was observed. The effect of milk fat content on microbial survival in processed cheese was also evaluated. The growth of Bacillus sp. was affected by the fat level of processed cheese while population levels of Clostridium sp. did not differ in processed cheese samples with 30, 40 and 50% fat in dry matter.
TI  - The self-assembly of a cyclic lipopeptides mixture secreted by a B. megaterium strain and its implications on activity against a sensitive Bacillus species.
AB  - Cyclic lipopeptides are produced by a soil Bacillus megaterium strain and several other Bacillus species. In this work, they are detected both in the Bacillus intact cells and the cells culture medium by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The cyclic lipopeptides self-assemble in water media producing negatively charged and large aggregates (300-800 nm of mean hydrodynamic radius) as evaluated by dynamic light scattering and zeta-potential analysis. The aggregate size depends on pH and ionic strength. However, it is not affected by changes in the osmolarity of the outer medium suggesting the absence of an internal aqueous compartment despite the occurrence of low molecular weight phospholipids in their composition as determined from inorganic phosphorus analysis. The activity against a sensitive Bacillus cereus strain was evaluated from inhibition halos and B. cereus lysis. Essential features determining the antibiotic activity on susceptible Bacillus cereus cells are the preserved cyclic moiety conferring cyclic lipopeptides resistance to proteases and the medium pH. The aggregates are inactive per se at the pH of the culture medium which is around 6 or below. The knock out of the sensitive cells only takes place when the aggregates are disassembled due to a high negative charge at pH above 6.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial metabolites from an endophytic Aspergillus sp. associated with Melia azedarach.
AB  - Seven known metabolites, dianhydro-aurasperone C (1), isoaurasperone A (2), fonsecinone A (3), asperpyrone A (4), asperazine (5), rubrofusarin B (6) and (R)-3-hydroxybutanonitrile (7), were isolated from the culture of Aspergillus sp. KJ-9, a fungal endophyte isolated from Melia azedarach and identified by spectroscopic methods. All isolates were evaluated in vitro against several phytopathogenic fungi (Gibberella saubinetti, Magnaporthe grisea, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Alternaria solani) and pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus). Compounds 3 and 7 were active against almost all phytopathogenic fungi tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6.25-50 muM. Moreover, compound 3 was active against all pathogenic bacteria with MIC in the range of 25-100 muM. Compound 7 is a rare new natural product isolated from a natural source for the first time, and the detailed NMR data of 1 were first assigned.
TI  - Gene detection and toxin production evaluation of hemolysin BL of Bacillus cereus isolated from milk and dairy products marketed in Brazil.
AB  - Bacillus cereusis an ubiquitous, spore-forming bacteria that can survive pasteurization and the majority of the heating processes used in the dairy industry. Besides, it is a pathogen responsible for different types of food poisoning. One type of foodborne disease caused by B.cereusis the diarrheal syndrome, which is caused by the ingestion of vegetative cells producing toxins in the small intestine. One virulence factor for the diarrheal syndrome is the toxin hemolysin BL (HBL), a three-component protein formed by the L1, L2 and B components. In order to evaluate the presence of diarrheal strains isolated from milk and dairy products, 63 B. cereus isolates were obtained from 260 samples of UHT milk, pasteurized milk and powdered milk, sold in commercial establishments and from different brands. The isolates were subjected to the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the detection of the encoding genes for the L1, L2 and B components and the toxin production capacity were evaluated with an immunoassay. A total of 23 [36.5%] isolates were identified carrying simultaneously the three tested genes, from which, 20 [86.9%] showed toxigenic capacity. 26 [41.3%] isolates did not carry any of genes tested and the other 14 [22.2%] were positive for one or two of them. The results showed a high toxigenic capacity among the B. cereus isolates able to produce the HBL, indicating a potential risk for consumers.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of chitinase-producing Bacillus and Paenibacillus  strains from salted and fermented shrimp, Acetes japonicus.
AB  - Chitinases catalyze the conversion of chitin and are produced by a wide range of  bacteria. The biological applications of these enzymes have been exploited in food and pharmaceutical industries. We isolated 2 halophilic chitinase-producing novel strains of bacteria-SCH-1 and SCH-2 from Saeu-jeot, a traditional Korean salted and fermented food made with shrimp (Acetes japonicus). The isolated strains- SCH-1 and SCH-2 were Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming facultative anaerobes, with strain SCH-2 showing peritrichous flagella. Molecular characterization of the 16S rRNA gene identified the strains SCH-1 and SCH-2 as Bacillus sp. and Paenibacillus sp. respectively. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and subsequent phylogenetic analysis of strain SCH-1 showed an identity of 97.83% with Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 (NR_074540), whereas strain SCH-2 showed an identity of 99.16% with Paenibacillus lautus JCM 9073 (NR_040882). Furthermore, the SCH-1 strain could use glucose, N-acetyl glucosamine, esculin, and maltose as carbon source substrates. Cellular fatty acid analysis showed that iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0 are the major acids in strain SCH-1 and SCH-2, respectively. The SCH-1 strain showed a higher chitinase activity at 15.71 unit/mg protein compared with SCH-2 strain. Chitinase isozymes of Bacillus sp. SCH-1was expressed as 2 bands having sizes of 41 and 50 kDa, and as 4 bands with sizes of 30, 37, 45.7, and 50 kDa in Paenibacillus sp. SCH-2. The rich chitinase activity with the isozyme profiles of the isolated Bacillus and Paenibacillus strains provide advancement in the study of fermentation and may play putative functions in the chitin bioconversion of sea crustacean foods.
TI  - Tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  - Binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. Hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. The present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. The results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. We hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. The alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. Bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. These findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.
TI  - Multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay for detection of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella sp., Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in spiked shrimps (Penaeus monodon).
AB  - The coastal aquaculture mainly shrimps constitute major export sector in Bangladesh and is increasingly shaped by international trade conditions and by national responses to those stringent quality and safety standards. PCR based validated methods for detection of major bacterial pathogens in shrimp might be very useful tool for ensuring quality and safety standards of exportable shrimps. The objective of this study was to evaluate overall performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the multiplex PCR assay for detection of Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 from spiked shrimp samples. The targeted genes were ompW for V. cholerae, tdh for V. parahaemolyticus, sefA for Salmonella spp. and hlyEHEC for E. coli O157:H7. The genomic DNA was extracted by using standard method and amplified accordingly. Sensitivity of the assay was tested by inoculating the shrimp homogenate with viable cells of laboratory references strains (target pathogens). The genes were amplified individually both from culture homogenate and spiked samples. Twenty different uniplex and multiplex PCR assay were performed; the results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR are comparable to that of the results of uniplex PCR for the samples. DNA extracted from shrimp samples spiked with non-target pathogen (Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus) yielded negative results.
TI  - Impact of donor arm cleaning with different aseptic solutions for prevention of contamination in blood bags.
AB  - Transfusion associated sepsis cases are encountered occasionally and bacterial transmission remains the major cause. The goal of our study was to compare the efficacy of disinfectants in phlebotomy site preparation. After selection of donor the antecubital fossa area of the arm was disinfected with different types of disinfectants namely sprit (70% isopropyl alcohol), povidone iodine (0.5% w/v available iodine in distilled water), savlon (1.5% v/v chlorhexidine gluconate solution and 3.0% cetrimide solution) and combination of sprit and povidone iodine. Swabs were collected from 20 donors using a sterile forceps, after cleaning with different antiseptic solutions. Swab was streaked on blood agar plate aseptically and the plate was incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Colonies were counted and a single colony was re-cultured by growing on nutrient and Mac-Conkey agar. The biochemical characteristics were determined by performing Gram staining, Motility, Catalase and Oxidase tests. The mean values of colonies were significantly higher with savlon compared to other three solutions. The difference was statistically significant by "t" test (t values 1.7-3.0; P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cereus were the organisms identified. After completion of bleeding, samples from the bag were aseptically inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles to be tested on BacT/Alert system. The bag containing donor's blood did not show any contamination when three cleanings were carried out using sprit, povidone iodine and spirit respectively.
TI  - A one-pot system for production of L-2-aminobutyric acid from L-threonine by L-threonine deaminase and a NADH-regeneration system based on L-leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase.
AB  - L-2-Aminobutyric acid (L-ABA) is an unnatural amino acid that is a key intermediate for the synthesis of several important drugs. It can be produced by transaminase or dehydrogenase from alpha-ketobutyric acid, which can be synthesized enzymatically from the bulk amino acid, L-threonine. Deamination of L-threonine followed by a hydrogenation reaction gave almost the theoretical yield and was estimated to be more cost-effective than the established chemical process. L-Threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli, L-leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus cereus, and formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. were over-expressed in E. coli and used for one-pot production of L-ABA with formate as a co-substrate for NADH regeneration. 30 mol L-threonine were converted to 29.2 mol L-ABA at 97.3 % of theoretical yield and with productivity of 6.37 g l(-1) h(-1) at 50 l. This process offers a promising approach to fulfil industrial requirements for L-ABA.
TI  - Efficient Degradation of Feather by Keratinase Producing Bacillus sp.
AB  - Keratinase producing microorganisms are being increasingly utilized for degradation and recycling of poultry feather waste. Two native strains BF11 (Bacillus subtilis) and BF21 (Bacillus cereus) degrading keratin completely were characterized. The native strains produced more than 10 KU/mL of enzyme. Strain improvement resulted in isolation of MBF11 and MBF21 from BF11 and BF21 isolates, respectively. Optimization of nutritional and physical parameters of these MBF isolates at laboratory scale increased the overall keratinase activity by 50-fold resulting in a yield of 518-520 KU/mL. Fermentation media designed with starch as carbon source and soya bean meal as nitrogen source supported high levels of enzyme production. The optimum conditions for enzyme production were determined to be pH 8.5 and temperatures of 45-55 degrees C for MBF11 and 37 degrees C for MBF21, respectively. Culture filtrate showed a significant increase in the amounts of cysteine, cystine, methionine, and total free amino acids during the fermentation period. The ratio of organic sulphur concentration was also considerably higher than that of the inorganic sulphate in the culture filtrate suggesting the hydrolysis of disulphide by the isolates.
TI  - Three bioactive cyclic dipeptides from the Bacillus sp. N strain associated with  entomopathogenic nematode.
AB  - In continuation of our search for new bioactive secondary metabolites from Bacillus cereus associated with entomopathogenic nematode (EPN), three cyclic dipeptides (CDPs), cyclo(L-Leu-D-Arg) (1), cyclo(2-hydroxy-Pro-L-Leu) (2), and cyclo(L-Val-L-Pro) (3) were purified from the ethyl acetate extract of B. cereus. The chemical structure of the compounds was identified by 1D, 2D NMR and HR-ESI-MS. Cyclo(L-Leu-D-Arg) recorded best antifungal activity and the highest activity was recorded against Cryptococcus neoformans (1 mug/mL), which is better than the standard antifungal agent amphotericin B. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used for finding cell proliferation inhibition and cyclo(L-Leu-D-Arg) recorded significant activity against breast cancer cell line (MDAM-B231) (IC50 value: 25 muM) and the three cyclic dipeptides recorded no toxicity against normal human cell (fore skin (FS) normal fibroblast) up to 50 muM except cyclo(L-Val-L-Pro). Cyclo(L-Leu-D-Arg) induced significant morphological changes and DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis in MDAM-B231 cells by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry analysis. Out of three cyclic dipeptides tested only cyclo(2-hydroxy-Pro-L-Leu) recorded significant antioxidant activity. The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of cyclo(2-hydroxy-Pro-L-Leu) is greater than BHA, the standard antioxidant agent. Cyclo(L-Leu-D-Arg) was isolated for the first time from a natural source with a d-arginine residue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the bioactivity of the isolated cyclic dipeptides is reported against medically important fungi and cancer cells. This study is a significant contribution to the knowledge of cyclo(L-Leu-D-Arg) from B. cereus as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmacological industry, especially as potent antifungal and anticancer agent.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a new intracellular antimicrobial peptide produced by Paenibacillus alvei AN5.
AB  - A wild-type, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming and motile bacteria has been isolated from palm oil mill sludge in Malaysia. Molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacteria belonged to genus Paenibacillus. With 97 % similarity to P. alvei (AUG6), the isolate was designated as P. alvei AN5. An antimicrobial compound was extracted from P. alvei AN5-pelleted cells using 95 % methanol and was then lyophilized. Precipitates were re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), producing an antimicrobial crude extract (ACE). The ACE showed antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Escherichia coli ATCC 29522, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014. By using SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography, Sephadex G-25 gel filtration and Tricine SDS-PAGE, the ACE was purified, which produced a ~2-kDa active band. SDS-PAGE and infrared (IR) spectroscopy indicated the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound in the ACE, and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and de novo sequencing using an automatic, Q-TOF premier system detected a peptide with the amino acid sequence F-C-K-S-L-P-L-P-L-S-V-K (1,330.7789 Da). This novel peptide was designated as AN5-2. The antimicrobial peptide exhibited stability from pH 3 to 12 and maintained its activity after being heated to 90 degrees C. It also remained active after incubation with denaturants (urea, SDS and EDTA).
TI  - Effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. We studied the effect of Substance P (SP), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. Exposure to SP strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of B. cereus (+553+/-3% with SP 10(-6) M) and this effect was rapid (<5 min). Infection of keratinocytes with SP treated B. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. Secretome analysis revealed that SP stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the S-layer and the release of S-layer proteins. Meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of B. cereus was increased. The Thermo unstable ribosomal Elongation factor (Ef-Tu) was identified as the SP binding site in B. cereus. Other Gram positive skin bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to SP by an increase of virulence. Thermal water from Uriage-les-Bains and an artificial polysaccharide (Teflose(R)) were capable to antagonize the effect of SP on bacterial virulence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SP is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. Our study suggests that a direct effect of SP on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.
TI  - Growth of enterotoxin producing Bacillus cereus in meat substrate at 10 masculineC and 30 masculineC.
AB  - The behaviour of enterotoxin-producing Bacillus cereus in meat was investigated by inoculating spore suspensions of five cultures into meat substrate (pH 5.8) and incubating at 10 masculineC and 30 masculineC. The bacterial populations were evaluated after different times by plate counts in nutrient agar. All the cultures presented growth at 30 masculineC with the generation time varying from 28.8 to 36.0 minutes. Three cultures also presented growth at 10 masculineC with generation times between 10.16 and 28.38 h. Considering the results, it was concluded that meat kept at abusive temperatures would be subject to development of this microorganism.
TI  - Beetroot-pigment-derived colorimetric sensor for detection of calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores.
AB  - In this proof-of-concept study, we describe the use of the main red beet pigment  betanin for the quantification of calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis. In the presence of europium(III) ions, betanin is converted to a water-soluble, non-luminescent orange 1ratio1 complex with a stability constant of 1.4 x 10(5) L mol(-1). The addition of calcium dipicolinate, largely found in bacterial spores, changes the color of the aqueous solution of [Eu(Bn)(+)] from orange to magenta. The limit of detection (LOD) of calcium dipicolinate is around 2.0 x 10(-6) mol L(-1) and the LOD determined for both spores, B. cereus and B. anthracis, is (1.1 +/- 0.3)x 10(6) spores mL(-1). This simple, green, fast and low cost colorimetric assay was selective for calcium dipicolinate when compared to several analogous compounds. The importance of this work relies on the potential use of betalains, raw natural pigments, as colorimetric sensors for biological applications.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - Bioactive metabolites from an endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. inhabiting Clidemia hirta.
AB  - An endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. was isolated from Clidemia hirta and analyzed  for its secondary metabolites that lead to the isolation of three bioactive molecules. The compounds were purified from the culture broth of the fungus and their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods as (R)-5-hydroxy-2-methylchroman-4-one (1), 1-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)pentan-1-one (2) and (Z)-1-(2-(2-butyryl-3-hydroxyphenoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxybut-2-en-1-one (3). Compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the human leukemia cell line, HL-60 with an IC50 of 4 mug/ml. This compound induced G2 arrest of the HL-60 cell cycle significantly. In addition, out of these compounds, 2 and 3 were active against several bacterial pathogens. Compound 2 was active against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with IC50 values varying from 18 to 30 mug/ml, and compound 3 displayed activity against Pseudomonas fluorescens with an IC50 value of 6 mug/ml. Compounds 2 and 3 are novel whereas compound 1 was reported earlier but the stereochemistry of its C-2 methyl is established for the first time.
TI  - Purification and characterization of two polyhydroxyalcanoates from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - This work aimed to study the potential of 155 strains of Bacillus sp., isolated from a collection of Tunisian microorganisms, for polyhydroxyalcanoates production. The strains were submitted to a battery of standard tests commonly used for determining bioplastic properties. The findings revealed that two of the isolates, namely Bacillus US 163 and US 177, provided red excitations at a wavelength of approximately 543 nm. The polyhydroxyalcanoates produced by the two strains were purified. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were used to characterize the two biopolymers. Bacillus US 163 was noted to produce a poly methyl-3-hydroxy tetradecanoic acid (P-3HTD) with an average molecular weight of 455 kDa, a completely amorphous homopolymer without crystallinity. The US 177 strain produced a homopolymer of methyl-3-hydroxy octadecanoic acid (P3-HOD) with an average molecular weight of 555 kDa. Exhibiting the highest performance, US 163 and US 177 were submitted to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the results revealed that they belonged to the Bacillus cereus species. Overall, the findings indicated that the Bacilli from petroleum soil have a number of promising properties that make them promising candidates for bioplastic production.
TI  - Description of Bacillus toyonensis sp. nov., a novel species of the Bacillus cereus group, and pairwise genome comparisons of the species of the group by means of ANI calculations.
AB  - Strain BCT-7112(T) was isolated in 1966 in Japan from a survey designed to obtain naturally occurring microorganisms as pure cultures in the laboratory for use as probiotics in animal nutrition. This strain, which was primarily identified as Bacillus cereus var toyoi, has been in use for more than 30 years as the active ingredient of the preparation TOYOCERIN((R)), an additive for use in animal nutrition (e.g. swine, poultry, cattle, rabbits and aquaculture). Despite the fact that the strain was initially classified as B. cereus, it showed significant genomic differences from the type strains of the B. cereus group that were large enough (ANI values below 92%) to allow it to be considered as a different species within the group. The polyphasic taxonomic study presented here provides sufficient discriminative parameters to classify BCT-7112(T) as a new species for which the name Bacillus toyonensis sp. nov. is proposed, with BCT-7112(T) (=CECT 876(T); =NCIMB 14858(T)) being designated as the type strain. In addition, a pairwise comparison between the available genomes of the whole B. cereus group by means of average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculations indicated that besides the eight classified species (including B. toyonensis), additional genomospecies could be detected, and most of them also had ANI values below 94%. ANI values were on the borderline of a species definition only in the cases of representatives of B. cereus versus B. thuringiensis, and B. mycoides and B. weihenstephanensis.
TI  - Bioactive phenylalanine derivatives and cytochalasins from the soft coral-derived fungus, Aspergillus elegans.
AB  - One new phenylalanine derivative 4'-OMe-asperphenamate (1), along with one known  phenylalanine derivative (2) and two new cytochalasins, aspochalasin A1 (3) and cytochalasin Z24 (4), as well as eight known cytochalasin analogues (5-12) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus elegans ZJ-2008010, a fungus obtained from a soft coral Sarcophyton sp. collected from the South China Sea. Their structures and the relative configurations were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by chemical synthesis and Marfey's method. All isolated metabolites (1-12) were evaluated for their antifouling and antibacterial activities. Cytochalasins 5, 6, 8 and 9 showed strong antifouling activity against the larval settlement of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, with the EC50 values ranging from 6.2 to 37 muM. This is the first report of antifouling activity for this class of metabolites. Additionally, 8 exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially against four pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus albus, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  - Biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. Polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of PHB. The films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. The synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. The broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial PHB film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against the bacteria. Crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial PHB film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of molds, i.e., A. niger, A. flavus, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. In the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated PHB film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. Furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the PHB film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. The migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing PHB film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.
TI  - Monitoring the ecology of Bacillus during Daqu incubation, a fermentation starter, using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - Daqu, a traditional fermentation starter, has been used to produce attractively flavored foods such as vinegar and Chinese liquor for thousands of years. Although Bacillus spp. are one of the dominant microorganisms in Daqu, more precise information is needed to reveal why and how Bacillus became dominant in Daqu, and next, to assess the impact of Bacillus sp. on Daqu and its derived products. We combined culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to study the ecology of Bacillus during Daqu incubation. Throughout the incubation, 67 presumptive Bacillus spp. isolates were obtained, 52 of which were confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The identified organisms belonged to 8 Bacillus species: B. licheniformis, B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. cereus, B. circulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and B. anthracis. A primer set specific for Bacillus and related genera was used in a selective PCR study, followed by a nested DGGE PCR targeting the V9 region of the 16S rDNA. Species identified from the PCR-DGGE fingerprints were related to B. licheniformis, B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. pumilus, B. benzoevorans, and B. foraminis. The predominant species was found to be B. licheniformis. Certain B. licheniformis strains exhibited potent antimicrobial activities. The greatest species diversity occurred at the Liangmei stage of Daqu incubation. To date, we lack sufficient knowledge of Bacillus distribution in Daqu. Elucidating the ecology of Bacillus during Daqu incubation would enable the impact of Bacillus on Daqu to be accessed, and the quality and stabilization of Daqu-derived products to be optimized.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. METHODS: The microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria was conducted. Sedimentation technique using open Petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. Isolates were identified according to standard methods. RESULTS: Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). Male medical ward (MMW) and male surgical general (MSG) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (OT) was almost free of microbial burden. The bacteria isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Candida albicans and Alternaria sp. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while Penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. From the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.
TI  - Saccharosporones A, B and C, cytotoxic antimalarial angucyclinones from Saccharopolyspora sp. BCC 21906.
AB  - Three new angucyclinones, saccharosporones A, B and C, together with (+)-ochromycinone, (+)-rubiginone B2, tetrangulol methyl ether and fujianmycin A, were obtained from fermentation of the terrestrial actinomycete of the genus Saccharopolyspora BCC 21906 isolated from a soil collected in Chanthaburi Province, Thailand. Structures of the new compounds and their relative configurations were assigned by NMR spectral data interpretation. Saccharosporones A and B exhibited antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum K1 with IC50 values of 4.1 and 3.9 muM. Both metabolites also possessed cytotoxic activities against cancer cell lines (KB, MCF-7 and NCI-H187) and nonmalignant Vero cell, while saccharosporone C only showed cytotoxic activity against NCI-H187.
TI  - Assessment of functional and genetic diversity of aerobic endospore forming Bacilli from rhizospheric soil of Phyllanthus amarus L.
AB  - Fifty two aerobic and endospore forming Bacilli (AEFB) strains were recovered from rhizospheric soil of Phyllanthus amarus. Morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization by 16S rDNA gene sequencing has shown that these bacterial strains belong to six different genera of AEFB i.e. Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Paenibacillus, Terribacillus and Jeotgalibacillus. Analysis of their PGP activities has shown that 92.30 % strains produced indole acetic acid hormone, 86.53 % of the strains solubilized Phosphate and 44.23 % strains produced siderophore. Chitinase production activity was shown by 42.30 % of the strains and 21.15 % of the strains produced 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. 46.15 % of isolates have shown antagonistic activity against common fungal pathogen of the plant i.e. Corynespora cassiicola. Among all of the isolated strains B. Cereus JP44SK22 and JP44SK42 have shown all of the six plant growth promoting traits tested. B. megaterium strains (JP44SK18 and JP44SK35), Lysinibacillus sphaericus strains (JP44SK3 and JP44SK4) and Brevibacillus laterosporus strain JP44SK51 have also shown multiple PGP activities except ACC deaminase production activity. In the present study bacterial strain belonging to genera Jeotgalibacillus sp. JP44SK37 has been reported first time as a member of rhizospheric soil habitat and has also shown PGP activities. It can be concluded that Rhizosphere of P. amarus has harboured a good diversity of AEFB bacterial strains having a lot of biofertilizing and biocontrol abilities.
TI  - Gangrenous mastitis caused by Bacillus species in six goats.
AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION: 6 lactating dairy goats were examined because of acute mastitis. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Goats were considered to have endotoxemia on the basis of physical examination and clinicopathologic findings. The affected udder halves had gangrenous discolored distal portions with sharp demarcations from grossly normal tissue proximally. Udder secretions from the affected sides were serosanguineous in all cases. A Bacillus sp was isolated in pure cultures in all cases. In 1 case, the Bacillus sp was identified as Bacillus cereus. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Goats were treated for mastitis and endotoxemia with polyionic IV fluid therapy, systemic and intramammary antimicrobial administration, anti-inflammatory drug administration, and other supportive treatment. All goats survived to discharge. All except 1 goat had follow-up information available. The affected udder halves sloughed in 1 to 2 months following discharge. In subsequent lactations after the mastitis episodes, milk production in 2 of 5 goats was above the mean, as determined on the basis of Dairy Herd Improvement records, and 3 of 5 goats were voluntarily withdrawn from lactation. All 5 goats had successful kiddings after the Bacillus mastitis episode. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Bacillus sp should be considered as a causative agent in goats with gangrenous mastitis, especially when the Bacillus sp is isolated in a pure culture. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing is recommended for selection of an appropriate antimicrobial for treatment. Prognosis for survival appears to be good, although milk production may be decreased.
TI  - Native soil bacteria isolates in Mexico exhibit a promising antagonistic effect against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici.
AB  - Sinaloa state accounts for 23% of Mexico's tomato production. One constraint on this important crop is the Fusarium crown and root rot, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, which has been reported to reduce crop yield by up to 50%. In this study, we set out to identify bacterial populations which could be used to control this disease through natural antagonism. Five tomato rhizospheric soil samples were collected, dried for 1-week, and homogenized. Sub-samples were used to prepare an aqueous solution used to isolate microorganisms in pure cultures. Organisms were purified and grown separately, and used to generate a collection of 705 bacterial isolates. Thirty-four percent from this bank (254 strains) was screened against Forl, finding 27 bacteria displaying in vitro Forl growth inhibition levels from 5% to 60%. These isolates belonged to the genus Bacillus and their 16Sr DNA sequences showed that they are closely related to seven species and they were putatively designated as: B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, B. thuringiensis, B. megaterium, and B. pumilus. One isolate belonged to the genus Acinetobacter. Two B. subtilis isolates (144 and 151) and one B. cereus isolate (171) showed the best antagonistic potential against FCRRT when evaluated on seedlings. Plate and activity assays indicate that these isolates include a diverse repertoire of functional antagonistic traits that might explain their ability to control FCRRT. Moreover, bacteria showed partial hemolytic activity, and future research will be directed at ensuring that their application will be not harmful for humans and effective against Forl in greenhouse or field conditions.
TI  - Purification and identification of two antifungal cyclic dipeptides from Bacillus cereus subsp. thuringiensis associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode especially against Fusarium oxysporum.
AB  - The cell-free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus subsp. thuringiensis associated with an entomopathogenic nematode (EPN), Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp., exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain two cyclic dipeptides (CDPs). The structure and absolute stereochemistry of this compound were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclo(D-Pro-L-Met) and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Tyr). CDPs showed significantly higher activity than the standard fungicide bavistin against agriculturally important fungi, viz., Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Penicillium expansum. The highest activity of 2 microg/ml by cyclo(D-Pro-D-Tyr) was recorded against F. oxysporum, a plant pathogen responsible for causing fusarium wilt followed by R. solani, a pathogen that causes root rot and P. expansum. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of these compounds from Rhabditis EPN bacterial strain Bacillus cereus subsp. thuringiensis.
TI  - Screening antimicrobial activity of various extracts of Urtica dioica.
AB  - Urtica dioica or stinging nettle is traditionally used as an herbal medicine in Western Asia. The current study represents the investigation of antimicrobial activity of U. dioica from nine crude extracts that were prepared using different organic solvents, obtained from two extraction methods: the Soxhlet extractor (Method I), which included the use of four solvents with ethyl acetate and hexane, or the sequential partitions (Method II) with a five solvent system (butanol). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude extracts were tested against 28 bacteria, three yeast strains and seven fungal isolates by the disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. Amoxicillin was used as positive control for bacteria strains, vancomycin for Streptococcus sp., miconazole nitrate (30 microg/mL) as positive control for fungi and yeast, and pure methanol (v/v) as negative control. The disc diffusion assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the samples, whilst the broth dilution method was used for the determination of the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC). The ethyl acetate and hexane extract from extraction method I (EA I and HE I) exhibited highest inhibition against some pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, MRSA and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. A selection of extracts that showed some activity was further tested for the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC). MIC values of Bacillus subtilis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using butanol extract of extraction method II (BE II) were 8.33 and 16.33mg/mL, respectively; while the MIC value using ethyl acetate extract of extraction method II (EAE II) for Vibrio parahaemolyticus was 0.13mg/mL. Our study showed that 47.06% of extracts inhibited Gram-negative (8 out of 17), and 63.63% of extracts also inhibited Gram-positive bacteria (7 out of 11); besides, statistically the frequency of antimicrobial activity was 13.45% (35 out of 342) which in this among 21.71% belongs to antimicrobial activity extracts from extraction method I (33 out of 152 of crude extracts) and 6.82% from extraction method II (13 out of 190 of crude extracts). However, crude extracts from method I exhibited better antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria than the Gram-negative bacteria. The positive results on medicinal plants screening for antibacterial activity constitutes primary information for further phytochemical and pharmacological studies. Therefore, the extracts could be suitable as antimicrobial agents in pharmaceutical and food industry.
TI  - Distinct functions of polysaccharide deacetylases in cell shape, neutral polysaccharide synthesis and virulence of Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - Peptidoglycan deacetylases (PGNG-dacs) belong to the Carbohydrate Esterase Family 4 (CE4) and have been described as required for bacterial evasion to lysozyme and innate immune responses. Interestingly, there is an unusual occurrence of 10 putative polysaccharide deacetylases, including five PGNG-dacs, in the Bacillus sp. genomes, especially B. cereus and B. anthracis. To elucidate the physiological role of these multiple deacetylases, we employed genetic analysis and protein localization studies of five putative PGNG-dacs from B. anthracis as well as biochemical analysis of their corresponding homologues from B. cereus. Our data confirm that three enzymes are PGNG-dacs. While BA1977, associated with lateral peptidoglycan synthesis, is a bona fide peptidoglycan deacetylase involved in resistance to host lysozyme and required for full virulence, BA1961 and BA3679 participate in the biogenesis of the peptidoglycan during both elongation and cell division. Furthermore, two enzymes are important for neutral polysaccharide attachment to PG and consequently anchoring of S-layer proteins (BA5436) and for polysaccharide modification (BA2944). Our results provide novel and fundamental insights into the function of polysaccharide deacetylases in a major bioterrorism agent.
TI  - Combination of culture-independent and culture-dependent molecular methods for the determination of bacterial community of iru, a fermented Parkia biglobosa seeds.
AB  - In this study, bacterial composition of iru produced by natural, uncontrolled fermentation of Parkia biglobosa seeds was assessed using culture-independent method in combination with culture-based genotypic typing techniques. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed similarity in DNA fragments with the two DNA extraction methods used and confirmed bacterial diversity in the 16 iru samples from different production regions. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE identified species related to Bacillus subtilis as consistent bacterial species in the fermented samples, while other major bands were identified as close relatives of Staphylococcus vitulinus, Morganella morganii, B. thuringiensis, S. saprophyticus, Tetragenococcus halophilus, Ureibacillus thermosphaericus, Brevibacillus parabrevis, Salinicoccus jeotgali, Brevibacterium sp. and uncultured bacteria clones. Bacillus species were cultured as potential starter cultures and clonal relationship of different isolates determined using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) combined with 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR amplification, restriction analysis (ITS-PCR-RFLP), and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR). This further discriminated B. subtilis and its variants from food-borne pathogens such as B. cereus and suggested the need for development of controlled fermentation processes and good manufacturing practices (GMP) for iru production to achieve product consistency, safety quality, and improved shelf life.
TI  - Induction of drought tolerance in cucumber plants by a consortium of three plant  growth-promoting rhizobacterium strains.
AB  - Our previous work showed that a consortium of three plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) strains (Bacillus cereus AR156, Bacillus subtilis SM21, and Serratia sp. XY21), termed as BBS for short, was a promising biocontrol agent. The present study investigated its effect on drought tolerance in cucumber plants. After withholding watering for 13 days, BBS-treated cucumber plants had much darker green leaves and substantially lighter wilt symptoms than control plants. Compared to the control, the BBS treatment decreased the leaf monodehydroascorbate (MDA) content and relative electrical conductivity by 40% and 15%, respectively; increased the leaf proline content and the root recovery intension by 3.45-fold and 50%, respectively; and also maintained the leaf chlorophyll content in cucumber plants under drought stress. Besides, in relation to the control, the BBS treatment significantly enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and mitigated the drought-triggered down-regulation of the expression of the genes cAPX, rbcL, and rbcS encoding cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxy/oxygenase (Rubisco) large and small subunits, respectively, in cucumber leaves. However, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity was undetected in none of the culture solutions of three BBS constituent strains. These results indicated that BBS conferred induced systemic tolerance to drought stress in cucumber plants, by protecting plant cells, maintaining photosynthetic efficiency and root vigor and increasing some of antioxidase activities, without involving the action of ACC deaminase to lower plant ethylene levels.
TI  - Genome sequence of the aerobic bacterium Bacillus sp. strain FJAT-13831.
AB  - Bacillus sp. strain FJAT-13831 was isolated from the no. 1 pit soil of Emperor Qin's Terracotta Warriors in Xi'an City, People's Republic of China. The isolate showed a close relationship to the Bacillus cereus group. The draft genome sequence of Bacillus sp. FJAT-13831 was 4,425,198 bp in size and consisted of 5,567 genes (protein-coding sequences [CDS]) with an average length of 782 bp and a G+C value of 36.36%.
TI  - [Septicaemia of chironomid larvae (Diptera: Chironomidae) promoted by Bacillus cereus and B. thuringiensis].
AB  - Natural factors regulating the population of chironomids were studied. The bacteria Bacillus cereus were isolated from chironomids sampled from Kuyalnitskii Firth after epizooty of Chironomus sp., and bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis spp. israelensis (Bti) were isolated from dead larva of Chironomus plumosus sampled in the Sea of Azov (3-m depth). Bti were characterized by high insecticide activity on midges Anopheles messeae Fall., Aedes cireneus Mg., and Culex pipiens pipiens f. pipiens L.
TI  - A piscidin-like antimicrobial peptide from the icefish Chionodraco hamatus (Perciformes: Channichthyidae): molecular characterization, localization and bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered one of the most ancient components of the innate immune system. They are able to exert their protection activity against a variety of microorganisms, and are widely distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this paper we focused on an AMP identified in the Antarctic teleost Chionodraco hamatus, an icefish species. The cDNA sequence of the AMP, named chionodracine, is comprised of 515 bp and translates for a putative protein precursor of 80 amino acids, with a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The structural features evidenced in the primary sequence of chionodracine lead to the inclusion of the peptide in the antimicrobial family of piscidins. The analysis by real-time PCR of the basal gene transcripts of chionodracine in different icefish tissues showed that the highest expression was found in gills, followed by head kidney. The chionodracine expression levels in head kidney leukocytes were up-regulated in vitro both by LPS and poly I:C, and in vivo by LPS. A putative chionodracine mature peptide was synthesized and employed to obtain a polyclonal antiserum, which was used in immunohistochemistry of gills sections and revealed a significant positivity associated with mast cells. The bactericidal activity of the peptide was investigated and found significant against Antarctic psychrophilic bacteria strains (Psychrobacter sp. TAD1 and TA144), the Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, and at a lesser extent against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Interestingly, the haemolytic activity of chionodracine was tested in vitro on human erythrocytes and no significant lysis occurred until peptide concentration of 50 muM.
TI  - Biodegradation of dioxin by a newly isolated Rhodococcus sp. with the involvement of self-transmissible plasmids.
AB  - A newly isolated Rhodococcus sp. strain p52 could aerobically utilize dibenzofuran as the sole source of carbon and energy, and completely remove dibenzofuran at 500 mg l(-1) within 48 h. The strain metabolizes dibenzofuran by initial angular dioxygenation to yield 2,2',3-trihydroxybiphenyl. Strain p52 could also remove 70 % of 100 mg l(-1) 2-chlorodibenzofuran within 96 h and could metabolize a variety of aromatic compounds, namely dibenzo-p-dioxin, 2,8-dichlorodibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, biphenyl, naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, carbazole, indole, xanthene, phenoxathiin, xanthone, and 9-fluorenone. Two distinct gene clusters encoding angular dioxygenases (DbfA and DfdA) were amplified and sequenced. The dbfA and dfdA gene clusters are located on two circular plasmids, pDF01 and pDF02, respectively. Both plasmids are self-transmissible; that is, they can transfer to the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus cereus by conjugation.
TI  - Chemical characteristics of beddings for swine: effects of bedding depths and of  addition of inoculums in a pilot-scale.
AB  - The effect of depths and of addition of inoculums on the chemical content of swine beddings was evaluated. For beddings 0.25m (25D) and 0.50m (50D) deep, three treatments were tested in two repeats with the same beddings: control (no inoculums); T1 (250g of Bacillus cereus var. toyoii at 8.4x10(7)CFU/g); and T2 (250g of a pool of Bacillus sp. at 8.4x10(7)CFU/g) (250g for 25D and 500g for 50D). For 25D, the C:N ratio was lower, but N, K and C contents were greater than for 50D (P<0.05). The inoculums did not benefit any chemical parameter (P>0.05). In the second repeat, beddings presented lower C:N ratio and greater N, P and K contents than in the first repeat (P<0.05). Thus, the compost produced after using 25D twice had greater fertilizer value than that of 50D.
TI  - Bacillus cereus infection outbreak in captive psittacines.
AB  - This study reports an uncommon epizootic outbreak of Bacillus cereus that caused  the sudden death of 12 psittacines belonging to the species Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus (1 individual), Diopsittaca nobilis (1 individual), Ara severa (1 individual) and Ara ararauna (9 individuals) in a Brazilian zoo. Post-mortem examination of the animals reveled extensive areas of lung hemorrhage, hepatic congestion, hemorrhagic enteritis and cardiac congestion. Histopathological examination of the organs showed the presence of multiple foci of vegetative cells of Gram-positive bacilli associated with discrete and moderate mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate. Seventeen B. cereus strains isolated from blood and sterile organs of nine A. ararauna were analyzed in order to investigate the genetic diversity (assessed by Rep-PCR) and toxigenic profiles (presence of hblA, hblC and hblD; nheA, nheB and nheC as well as cytK, ces and entFM genes) of such strains. Amplification of genomic DNA by Rep-PCR of B. cereus strains generated two closely related profiles (Rep-PCR types A and B) with three bands of difference. All strains were classified as belonging to the toxigenic profile I which contained HBL and NHE gene complexes, entFM and cytK genes. Altogether, microbiological and histopathological findings and the evidence provided by the success of the antibiotic prophylaxis, corroborate that B. cereus was the causative agent of the infection that killed the birds.
TI  - Statistical optimization of a novel low-cost medium based on regional agro-industrial by-products for the production of proteolytic enzymes by Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Bacillus sp. are specific producers of peptidase amongst bacteria and peptidase enzymes and are of significant ones due to their multifarious applications. Advances in industrial biotechnology offer potential opportunities for economic utilization of agro-industrial by-products for many biochemical reactions. Due to their rich organic nature, they can serve as an ideal substrate for the production of different value added products like peptidases. In the present work, an attempt was made to optimize different variables by Taguchi methodology for the production of peptidase using agro-industrial by-products hydrolyzed by a Bacillus cereus strain, resulting in brewer's spent grain (BSG) being the optimal organic substrate. Subsequently, operative variables for the BSG were investigated using Taguchi methodology in order to maximize the enzyme production. Additionally, the main medium components were optimized using a mixture design. Finally, the production of peptidase by B. cereus was investigated; also the possible interaction with other proteolytic microbial strains was evaluated. A notorious synergistic effect was observed when B. cereus was inoculated with Pseudomonas sp. These brought a triple benefit, first, opening the possibility to produce technical enzymes at low cost, second, giving greater value to a food industry by-product, and third, reducing the environmental impact caused by the product removal directly into the environment.
TI  - Screening and identification of polyhydroxyalkanoates producing bacteria and biochemical characterization of their possible application.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) accumulating bacteria were isolated under various selective conditions such as pH, salt concentrations and types of heavy metal. Fifty strains of bacterial isolates were found to belong to Bacillus, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes and Chromobacterium, based on phenotypical features and genotypic investigation. Only twenty five bacterial isolates were selected and observed for the production of PHAs. Interestingly, bacteria belonging to Firmucutes Bacillus sp. produced a high amount of PHAs. The maximum PHAs were accumulated by B. licheniformis PHA 007 at 68.80% of dry cell weight (DCW). Pseudomonas sp., Aeromonas sp., Alcaligenes sp. and Chromobacterium sp. were recorded to produce a moderate amount of PHAs, varying from 10.00-44.32% of DCW. The enzymatic activity was preliminarily analyzed by the ratio of the clear zone diameter to colony diameter. Bacillus gave the highest ratio of hydrolysis zone which corresponds to the highest hydrolytic enzyme activities. Bacillus licheniformis PHA 007 had the highest lipase and protease activity at 2.1 and 5.1, respectively. However, the highest amylase activity was observed in Bacillus sp. PHA 023 at 1.4. Determination of metabolic characteristics was also investigated to check for their ability to consume a wide range of substrates. Bacillus, Aeromonas sp. and Alcaligenes sp. had great ability to utilize a variety of substrates. To decrease high PHA cost, different sources of cheap substrates were tested for the production of PHAs. Bacillus cereus PHA 008 gave the maximal yield of PHA production (64.09% of DCW) when cultivated in anaerobically treated POME. In addition, the accumulation of PHA copolymers such as 3-hydroxyvalerate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate was also observed in Bacillus and Pseudomomas sp. strain 012 and 045, respectively. Eight of the nine isolates accumulated a significant amount of PHAs when inexpensive carbon sources were used as substrates. Here it varied from 1.69% of DCW by B. licheniformis PHA 007 to 64.09% of DCW by B. cereus PHA 008.
TI  - The gut bacteria associated with Camponotus japonicus Mayr with culture-dependent and DGGE methods.
AB  - The bacterial composition and distribution in the different gut regions of Camponotus japonicus were investigated using both culture-dependent method and culture-independent method of polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Five different bacterial strains were isolated using culture-dependent method, and they all belong to the phylum Firmicutes, including three genera of bacteria Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Enterococcus. Bacillus cereus and Enterococcus mundtii were found in the midgut; Paenibacillus sp. was isolated from the hindgut; and the other two Bacillus spp. were isolated from the crop. Twelve distinct DGGE bands were found using PCR-DGGE method, and their sequences blasting analysis shows that they are members of the Proteobacteria and the Firmicutes, respectively, including three genera (Pseudomonas, Candidatus Blochmannia, Fructobacillus) and one uncultured bacterium, in which Pseudomonas was the most dominant bacteria group in all the three gut regions. According to the DGGE profile, the three gut regions had very similar gut communities, and all the DGGE bands were presented in the midgut and hindgut, while just two bands representing Blochmannia were not present in the crop. The results of our study indicate that the gut of C. japonicus harbors several other bacteria besides the obligate endosymbionts Blochmannia, and more work should be carried on to verify if they are common in the guts of other Camponotus ants.
TI  - Addition of Bacillus sp. inoculums in bedding for swine on a pilot scale: effect  on microbial population and bedding temperature.
AB  - Thermal and microbiological characteristics of beddings for swine were compared according to their depth and of addition of inoculums. Bedding was added to boxes at 0.25 (25D) and 0.50 m (50D), with three treatments: control (no inoculums); T1, with 250 g of Bacillus cereus var. toyoii at 8.4 x 10(7) CFU; and T2, with 250 g of a pool of B. subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus polymyxa at 8.4 x 10(7) CFU (250 g for 25D and 500 g for 50D). Mean temperatures were 28.5 +/- 3.9 at the surface and 35.2 +/- 8.9 inside the beddings. The most probable number (MPN) of thermophilic bacteria was higher for T1 and T2 than for the control (P<0.05). The MPN of thermophilic bacteria and fungi was greater for D50 than for D25 (P<0.05). The use of 25D without inoculums is recommended due to the reduction of thermophilic microbiota.
TI  - Biodegradation of malathion by Brevibacillus sp. strain KB2 and Bacillus cereus strain PU.
AB  - We report here the degradation of a pesticide, malathion, by Brevibacillus sp. strain KB2 and Bacillus cereus strain PU, isolated from soil samples collected from malathion contaminated field and an army firing range respectively. Both the strains were cultured in the presence of malathion under aerobic and energy-limiting conditions. Both strains grew well in the medium having malathion concentration up to 0.15%. Reverse phase HPLC-UV analysis indicated that Strain KB2 was able to degrade 72.20% of malaoxon (an analogue of malathion) and 36.22% of malathion, while strain PU degraded 87.40% of malaoxon and 49.31% of malathion, after 7 days of incubation. The metabolites mal-monocarboxylic acid and mal-dicarboxylic acid were identified by Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The factors affecting biodegradation efficiency were investigated and effect of malathion concentration on degradation rate was also determined. The strain was analyzed for carboxylesterase activity and maximum activity 210 +/- 2.5 U ml(-1) and 270 U +/- 2.7 ml(-1) was observed for strains KB2 and PU, respectively. Cloning and sequencing of putative malathion degrading carboxylesterase gene was done using primers based PCR approach.
TI  - [Endophytic bacterial community analysis of Catharanthus roseus and its association with huanglongbing pathogen].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the microbial diversity in healthy and HLB-affected Catharanthus roseus under manual-grafting conditions and to find the association between the endophytic bacteria and the HLB pathogen. METHODS: The endophytic bacterial communities were delineated by using the traditional culturable approach and cultivation-independent techniques based on 16S rRNA gene. The endophytic bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized C. roseus midribs of leaves and phloem of stems and roots by plating and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: By anaerobic culture, we obtained 67 strains that were identified 29 genus by GenBank. Curtobacterium sp. , Erwinia sp., Bacillus cereus and Brevundimonas sp. , Bacillus sp. were the dominant bacterial population in diseased and healthy C. roseus. However, Staphylococcus equorum was the common dominant isolate in both C. roseus. We picked 188 and 182 positive clones in 16S rDNA libraries of diseased and healthy C. roseus that were respectively restricted by the HaeIII, MspI, RsaI restriction endonuclease. Based on the similarity of the RFLP banding profiles in diseased and healthy C. roseus, we obtained 16, 23 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) respectively. In addition to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, Candidatus Liberibacter sp. was the dominant bacterial population only in diseased C. roseus. CONCLUSIONS: With the infection of 'Ca. L. asiaticus', the diversity in diseased C. roseus decreased. The endophytic bacteria isolated from diseased and healthy C. roseus are abundant and have remarkable differences in the composition and function, suggesting that its endophytic bacteria might be inhibited by the HLB pathogen.
TI  - [Diversity and antimicrobial activities of actinomycetes from pesticide-contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to study diversity and find antimicrobial activities of actinomycetes from pesticide-contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula. METHODS: The phylogenetic analysis of 154 isolated strains was done based on 16SrDNA sequences. Antimicrobial activities of 10 non-Streptomyces strains were tested by using cylinder-plate method and hypha growth rate method. RESULTS: Among the strains, 154 strains belonged to 7 families, 8 genera: Streptomyces (87.01%), Kocuria, Microbacterium, Nocardiopsis, Knoellia, Pseudonocardia, Micromonospora, Actinoplanes. The fermentation broths of 10 non-Streptomyces strains had inhibitory actives against all tested phytopathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, Gibberella zeae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Colletotrichum gloesporioides) and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Bacillus cereus, Escherichai coli, Pseudomonas aeruginos) , especially Microbacterium oxydans JN853773 and Kocuria rosea JN192402 had strong inhibitory effects. CONCLUSION: Abundant diversity of actinomycetes existed in pesticide contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula. Microbacterium oxydans JN853773 and Kocuria rosea JN192402 showed high antimicrobial activities and could be further exploited.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Pseudoalteromonas in the coral holobiont.
AB  - Corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic populations. Bacterial communities residing in the coral mucus layer may be either pathogenic or symbiotic. Some species may produce antibiotics as a method of controlling populations of competing microbial species. The present study characterizes cultivable Pseudoalteromonas sp. isolated from the mucus layer of different coral species from the northern Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea, Israel. Six mucus-associated Pseudoalteromonas spp. obtained from different coral species were screened for antibacterial activity against 23 tester strains. Five of the six Pseudoalteromonas strains demonstrated extracellular antibacterial activity against Gram-positive-but not Gram-negative-tester strains. Active substances secreted into the cell-free supernatant are heat-tolerant and inhibit growth of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and of ten endogenous Gram-positive marine bacteria isolated from corals. The Pseudoalteromonas spp. isolated from Red sea corals aligned in a phylogenetic tree with previously isolated Pseudoalteromonas spp. of marine origin that demonstrated antimicrobial activity. These results suggest that coral mucus-associated Pseudoalteromonas may play a protective role in the coral holobiont's defense against potential Gram-positive coral pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0174-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and probiotic properties of dominant lactic microflora from Tungrymbai, an ethnic fermented soybean food of India.
AB  - The present investigation was conducted to assess lactic acid bacteria present in traditionally fermented food of ethnic tribes in India for probiotic properties, antibacterial activity, and antibiotic tolerance behavior. Enterococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Lactococcus sp. showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus MTCC 430, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus MTCC 740, and Salmonella enterica ser. paratyphi A MTCC 735. Lactococcus sp. and Lactobacillus sp. could tolerate acidic conditions (pH 2) and high bile salt concentration (4000 ppm). The lactic microflora were found to be sensitive to most common antibiotics, except for cloxacillin (5 mug), cephalexin (30 mug), and cephalothin (30 mug).
TI  - Production of the antimicrobial peptides Caseicin A and B by Bacillus isolates growing on sodium caseinate.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii. CONCLUSIONS: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study highlights the potential to exploit Bacillus sp. or the enzymes they produce for the generation of bioactive antimicrobial peptides from bovine casein.
TI  - Novel polymer anchored Cr(III) Schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - New polymer-bound Schiff bases and Cr(III) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. The structure of polymeric-Schiff bases and their Cr(III) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR, UV-Vis, TG-DTA and (1)H-NMR. All these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus (RSKK-07035), Shigella dysenteria type 10 (RSKK 1036), Listeria monocytogenes 4b(ATCC 19115, Escherichia coli (ATCC 1230), Salmonella typhi H (NCTC 901.8394), Staphylococcus epidermis (ATCC 12228), Brucella abortus (RSKK-03026), Micrococcs luteus (ATCC 93419, Bacillus cereus sp., Pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Y-1200-NIH).
TI  - [Analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  - The selective culture method and PCR-DGGE technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. The results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. Along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. The UPGMA cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. Five different sequences (DF1-DF5) were obtained through BLAST analysis and retrieval. The closest known origin groups were located as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Burkholderia sp. respectively. The BLASTX comparison test showed that DF1 closely related to the activities of the Mycobacterium bacillus and the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, DF2 functioned as a conservative potential ATP binding protein, DF3 related to the activities of the Bacillus cereus spore, DF4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and DF5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - Biochemical and molecular characterization of high population density bacteria isolated from sunflower.
AB  - Natural and beneficial associations between plants and bacteria have demonstrated potential commercial application for several agricultural crops. The sunflower has acquired increasing importance in Brazilian agribusiness owing to its agronomic characteristics such as the tolerance to edaphoclimatic variations, resistance to pests and diseases, and adaptation to the implements commonly used for maize and soybean, as well as the versatility of the products and by-products obtained from its cultivation. A study of the cultivable bacteria associated with two sunflower cultivars, using classical microbiological methods, successfully obtained isolates from different plant tissues (roots, stems, florets, and rhizosphere). Out of 57 plantgrowth- promoting isolates obtained, 45 were identified at the genus level and phylogenetically positioned based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing: 42 Bacillus (B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. pumilus, B. megaterium, and Bacillus sp.) and 3 Methylobacterium komagatae. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed a broad diversity among the Bacillus isolates, which clustered into 2 groups with 75% similarity and 13 subgroups with 85% similarity, suggesting that the genetic distance correlated with the source of isolation. The isolates were also analyzed for certain growth-promoting activities. Auxin synthesis was widely distributed among the isolates, with values ranging from 93.34 to 1653.37 microM auxin per microng of protein. The phosphate solubilization index ranged from 1.25 to 3.89, and siderophore index varied from 1.15 to 5.25. From a total of 57 isolates, 3 showed an ability to biologically fix atmospheric nitrogen, and 7 showed antagonism against the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The results of biochemical characterization allowed identification of potential candidates for the development of biofertilizers targeted to the sunflower crop.
TI  - Microbiological and physicochemical characterisation of caxiri, an alcoholic beverage produced by the indigenous Juruna people of Brazil.
AB  - Caxiri is a traditional fermented alcoholic beverage produced from cassava and sweet potatoes by the indigenous Juruna or Yudja people in Brazil. Our results showed that caxiri fermentation is invariably associated with the following: (i) an increase in the total microbial population, with yeast being the largest group detected; (ii) a decrease in reducing sugars, malic, tartaric, succinic, oxalic and propionic acid; and (iii) a final product characterised by a high content of ethanol and a high concentration of lactic acid. The microbial community dynamics were investigated by culture-based and culture-independent approaches. Fermentation was assisted by a complex microbial community that changed in structure and composition during the fermentative process. The bacterial population ranged from 3.05 to 5.33 log/mL, and the yeast population varied from 3.27 log CFU/mL to 7.34 log CFU/mL, showing that yeasts dominated the fermentation process after 48 h. A total of 343 colonies of bacteria and 205 colonies of yeasts were isolated and initially grouped by Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) and by biochemical features. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of representative isolates showed that the bacteria were mainly represented by endospore-forming low-G+C content Gram-positive bacilli (Bacillus spp.; 61.5% of the isolates), with Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus spp. (Bacillus cereus group), and Bacillus subtilis being the main species identified. The species Sphingomonas sp. and Pediococcus acidilactici were also found. The dominant yeast identified was Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Pichia membranifaciens, Pichia guilliermondii and Cryptococcus luteolus were also found. According to the Polymerase Chain Reaction and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis, the microbial communities present during fermentation were probably from the raw materials, ambient or present on the utensils used during beverage preparation. The results indicated the necessity to combine both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods for a better description of the microbial communities in indigenous starch fermentations. Also, pH values decreased from 4.76 to 3.15 during fermentation. The ethanol concentration was 83.9 g/L and lactic acid reached 27.89 g/L by the end of the fermentation process.
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - Characterization of two metal resistant Bacillus strains isolated from slag disposal site at Burnpur, India.
AB  - Two strains of Bacillus sp. resistant to arsenate and lead designated as AsSP9 and PbSP6, respectively were isolated from the slag disposal site. They were identified to be related to Bacillus cereus cluster on the basis of 16S rDNA based sequence analysis and phenotypic characteristics. Both were rod-shaped (AsSP9, 2-5 microm and PbSP6, 2-4 microm), aerobic, salt tolerant (2-8% NaCI), endospore forming bacteria with minor differences like the AsSP9 showed sporangial bulging and PbSP6 had positive lipase activity. The temperature range for their growth was 20-40 degrees C and pH range 6.0-9.0 with an optimum temperature of 37 degrees C and pH of 7 for both strains. The principal nitrogen sources forAsSP9 and PbSP6 were DL-Tryptophan and L-Phenylalanine, respectively. The suitable carbon source forAsSP9 was lactose and for PbSP6 sucrose. The heavy metal accumulation efficiency was found to be 0.0047 mg g(-1) of dry mass forAsSP9 and 0.686 mg g(-1) of dry mass for PbSP6.
TI  - Bacillus cytotoxicus sp. nov. is a novel thermotolerant species of the Bacillus cereus Group occasionally associated with food poisoning.
AB  - An aerobic endospore-forming bacillus (NVH 391-98(T)) was isolated during a severe food poisoning outbreak in France in 1998, and four other similar strains have since been isolated, also mostly from food poisoning cases. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, these strains were shown to belong to the Bacillus cereus Group (over 97% similarity with the current Group species) and phylogenetic distance from other validly described species of the genus Bacillus was less than 95%. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and MLST data, these novel strains were shown to form a robust and well-separated cluster in the B. cereus Group, and constituted the most distant cluster from species of this Group. Major fatty acids (iso-C(15:0), C(16:0), iso-C(17:0), anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(16:0), iso-C(13:0)) supported the affiliation of these strains to the genus Bacillus, and more specifically to the B. cereus Group. NVH 391-98(T) taxon was more specifically characterized by an abundance of iso-C(15:0) and low amounts of iso-C(13:0) compared with other members of the B. cereus Group. Genome similarity together with DNA-DNA hybridization values and physiological and biochemical tests made it possible to genotypically and phenotypically differentiate NVH 391-98(T) taxon from the six current B. cereus Group species. NVH 391-98(T) therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Bacillus cytotoxicus sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain NVH 391-98(T) (= DSM 22905(T) = CIP 110041(T)).
TI  - Isolation and Growth Characteristics of Chromium(VI) and Pentachlorophenol Tolerant Bacterial Isolate from Treated Tannery Effluent for its Possible Use in Simultaneous Bioremediation.
AB  - The bacterial strains resistant to pentachlorophenol (PCP) and hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] were isolated from treated tannery effluent of a common effluent treatment plant. Most of the physico-chemical parameters analyzed were above permissible limits. Thirty-eight and four bacterial isolates, respectively were found resistant to >50 mug/ml concentration of [Cr(VI)] and the same level of PCP. Out of the above 42 isolates, only one was found simultaneously tolerant to higher levels of both PCP (500 mug/ml) and Cr(VI) (200 mug/ml), and hence was selected for further studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which a native bacterial isolate simultaneously tolerant to such a high concentrations of Cr(VI) and PCP has been reported. The culture growth was best at 0.4% (w/v) glucose as an additional carbon source and 0.2% (w/v) ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source. The growth results with cow urine as a nitrogen source were comparable with the best nitrogen source ammonium chloride. The isolate exhibited resistance to multiple heavy metals (Pb, As, Hg, Zn, Co & Ni) and to antibiotics nalidixic acid and polymixin-B. The efficacy of bacterial isolate for growth, PCP degradation (56.5%) and Cr(VI) bioremediation (74.5%) was best at 48 h incubation. The isolate was identified as Bacillus sp. by morphological and biochemical tests. The 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed 98% homology with Bacillus cereus. However, further molecular analysis is underway to ascertain its likelyhood of a novel species.
TI  - The pore-forming protein Cry5B elicits the pathogenicity of Bacillus sp. against  Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - The soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis is a pathogen of insects and nematodes  and is very closely related to, if not the same species as, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. The defining characteristic of B. thuringiensis that sets it apart from B. cereus and B. anthracis is the production of crystal (Cry) proteins, which are pore-forming toxins or pore-forming proteins (PFPs). Although it is known that PFPs are important virulence factors since their elimination results in reduced virulence of many pathogenic bacteria, the functions by which PFPs promote virulence are incompletely understood. Here we study the effect of Cry proteins in B. thuringiensis pathogenesis of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that whereas B. thuringiensis on its own is not able to infect C. elegans, the addition of the PFP Cry protein, Cry5B, results in a robust lethal infection that consumes the nematode host in 1-2 days, leading to a "Bob" or bag-of-bacteria phenotype. Unlike other infections of C. elegans characterized to date, the infection by B. thuringiensis shows dose-dependency based on bacterial inoculum size and based on PFP concentration. Although the infection process takes 1-2 days, the PFP-instigated infection process is irreversibly established within 15 minutes of initial exposure. Remarkably, treatment of C. elegans with Cry5B PFP is able to instigate many other Bacillus species, including B. anthracis and even "non-pathogenic" Bacillus subtilis, to become lethal and infectious agents to C. elegans. Co-culturing of Cry5B-expressing B. thuringiensis with B. anthracis can result in lethal infection of C. elegans by B. anthracis. Our data demonstrate that one potential property of PFPs is to sensitize the host to bacterial infection and further that C. elegans and probably other roundworms can be common hosts for B. cereus-group bacteria, findings with important ecological and research implications.
TI  - Diversity, mobility, and structural and functional evolution of group II introns  carrying an unusual 3' extension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group II introns are widespread genetic elements endowed with a dual  functionality. They are catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) that are able of self-splicing and they are also mobile retroelements that can invade genomic DNA. The group II intron RNA secondary structure is typically made up of six domains. However, a number of unusual group II introns carrying a unique extension of 53-56 nucleotides at the 3' end have been identified previously in bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group. METHODS: In the present study, we conducted combined sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of introns, host gene, plasmid and chromosome of host strains in order to gain insights into mobility, dispersal, and evolution of the unusual introns and their extension. We also performed in vitro mutational and kinetic experiments to investigate possible functional features related to the extension. RESULTS: We report the identification of novel copies of group II introns carrying a 3' extension including the first two copies in bacteria not belonging to the B. cereus group, Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 and Bacillus sp. 2_A_57_CT2, an uncharacterized species phylogenetically close to B. firmus. Interestingly, the B. pseudofirmus intron has a longer extension of 70 bases. From sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses, several possible separate events of mobility involving the atypical introns could be identified, including both retrohoming and retrotransposition events. In addition, identical extensions were found in introns that otherwise exhibit little sequence conservation in the rest of their structures, with the exception of the conserved and catalytically critical domains V and VI, suggesting either separate acquisition of the extra segment by different group II introns or a strong selection pressure acting on the extension. Furthermore, we show by in vitro splicing experiments that the 3' extension affects the splicing properties differently in introns belonging to separate evolutionary branches. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether this study provides additional insights into the structural and functional evolution of unusual introns harboring a 3' extension and lends further evidence that these introns are mobile with their extension.
TI  - Bacillus manliponensis sp. nov., a new member of the Bacillus cereus group isolated from foreshore tidal flat sediment.
AB  - A Gram-positive, endospore-forming, new Bacillus species, strain BL4-6(T), was isolated from tidal flat sediment of the Yellow Sea. Strain BL4-6(T) is a straight rod, with motility by peritrichate flagella. The cell wall contains meso-diaminopimelic acid, and the major respiratory quinone is menaquinone-7. The major fatty acids are iso-C(15:0) and summed feature 3 (containing C(16:1) omega7c/iso-C(15:0) 2OH, and/or iso-C(15:0) 2OH/C(16:1) omega7c). Cells are catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 38.0 mol%. Based on a comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate belongs to the genus Bacillus, forms a clade with the Bacillus cereus group, and is closely related to Bacillus mycoides (98.5%), Bacillus cereus (98.5%), Bacillus anthracis (98.4%), Bacillus thuringiensis (98.4%), Bacillus weihenstephanensis (98.1%), and Bacillus pseudomycoides (97.5%). The isolate showed less than 85% similarity of the gyrA gene sequence and below 95% similarity of the rpoB gene sequence to the members of this group. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain BL4-6(T) and B. cereus group was found to be in a range of 22.8-42.3%, and thus BL4-6(T) represents a unique species. On the basis of these studies, strain BL4-6(T) (=KCTC 13319(T) =JCM 15802(T)) is proposed to represent the type strain of a novel species, Bacillus manliponensis sp. nov.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Removal of high concentrations of NH(3) by a combined photoreactor and biotrickling filter system.
AB  - Average emission levels as high as 800 ppm(v) NH(3) have often been found during  the anaerobic fermentation process. At these levels, NH(3) is regarded as an environmental toxic compound. High concentrations of NH(3) gas are difficult to treat in a single treatment process, suggesting that, in terms of economic cost and treatment performance, a coupled system may be a feasible technological alternative. In the coupled TiO(2) photocatalytic-biological treatment system evaluated here, the optimal gas retention time for NH(3) removal--in terms of removal efficiency and capital cost--was 26 s. High gas temperatures, high NH(3) concentrations, and low oxygen contents were unfavorable conditions for NH(3) removal by the photoreactor. The coupled system successfully removed concentrated NH(3) gas (R % > 97 %) under disrupted and shutdown conditions. The photoreactor component of the system successfully fulfilled its role as a pretreatment process and enhanced the performance of the biotrickling filter at a high inlet NH(3) load (2,277 g-N m(-3) day(-1)). Potential ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas sp., were isolated under the high inlet NH(3) load condition. These microbial strains have a potential as biological agents in the removal of high concentrations of NH(3) in waste gas or wastewater.
TI  - N-acyl-homoserine lactones from Enterobacter sakazakii (Cronobacter spp.) and their degradation by Bacillus cereus enzymes.
AB  - A chemical study of acyl-homoserine lactones (acyl-HSLs) produced by Enterobacter sakazakii resulted in the identification of three molecules: (S)-N-heptanoyl-HSL, (S)-N-dodecanoyl-HSL and (S)-N-tetradecanoyl-HSL. Mixed cultures of E. sakazakii and Bacillus cereus depleted E. sakazakii acyl-HSLs, suggesting acyl-HSL degradation by B. cereus hydrolases (hydrolysis of the lactone or amide moiety). The expression of B. cereus acyl-HSL lactonase and acyl-homoserine acylase was confirmed by monitoring the biotransformation of (S)-N-dodecanoyl-HSL into (S)-N-dodecanoyl-homoserine, dodecanoic acid and homoserine in the presence of B. cereus whole cells, using electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).
TI  - Diversity and polymorphism in AHL-lactonase gene (aiiA) of Bacillus.
AB  - To explore bacterial diversity for elucidating genetic variability in acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) lactonase structure, we screened 800 bacterial strains. It revealed the presence of a quorum quenching (QQ) AHL-lactonase gene (aiiA) in 42 strains. These 42 strains were identified using rrs (16S rDNA) sequencing as Bacillus strains, predominantly B. cereus. An in silico restriction endonuclease (RE) digestion of 22 AHL lactonase gene (aiiA) sequences (from NCBI database) belonging to 9 different genera, along with 42 aiiA gene sequences from different Bacillus spp. (isolated here) with 14 type II REs, revealed distinct patterns of fragments (nucleotide length and order) with four REs; AluI, DpnII, RsaI, and Tru9I. Our study reflects on the biodiversity of aiiA among Bacillus species. Bacillus sp. strain MBG11 with polymorphism (115Alanine > Valine) may confer increased stability to AHL lactonase, and can be a potential candidate for heterologous expression and mass production. Microbes with ability to produce AHL-lactonases degrade quorum sensing signals such as AHL by opening of the lactone ring. The naturally occurring diversity of QQ molecules provides opportunities to use them for preventing bacterial infections, spoilage of food, and bioremediation.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of aerobic culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria from surfacewater and groundwater of Rautahat District, Nepal.
AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater is a serious Environmental Health Management issue of drinking water sources especially in Terai region of Nepal. Many studies have reported that due to natural abundance of arsenic in the environment, various bacteria have developed different resistance mechanisms for arsenic compound. In this study, the culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria indigenous to surfacewater as well as groundwater from Rautahat District of Nepal were randomly isolated by standard plate count method on the basis of viable growth on plate count agar amended with arsenate ranging from 0, 0.5, 10, 40, 80 to 160 milligram per liter (mg/l). With respect to the morphological and biochemical tests, nine morphologically distinct potent arsenate tolerant bacteria showed relatedness with Micrococcus varians, Micrococcus roseus, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas sp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus smithii 1 and Bacillus smithii 2. The isolates were capable of tolerating more than 1000 mg/l of arsenate and 749 mg/l of arsenite. Likewise, bioaccumulation capability was highest with M. roseus (85.61%) and the least with B. smithii (47.88%) indicating the potential of the organisms in arsenic resistance and most probably in bioremediation.
TI  - Effects of photoactivated titanium dioxide nanopowders and coating on planktonic  and biofilm growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - We exploited the ability of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) as an agent  for the biofilm control. Two photocatalytic systems were investigated: a 3 g L(-1) suspension of TiO(2) nanopowder in demineralized water and glass slides coated with a TiO(2) thin film, achieved by sol-gel deposition. A running protocol for the photoactivation of TiO(2) was set up using the dye rhodamine B. The microorganisms studied were Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a Bacillus cereus-group as planktonic cells. P. aeruginosa biofilms were also studied at both the solid-liquid and the solid-air interface. The TiO(2) nanopowder produced 1-log reduction of Bacillus sp. planktonic cells in 24 h, 2-log reduction of P. stutzeri planktonic cells in 30 min and 1-log reduction of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells in 2 h compared with non-photo-activated TiO(2). TiO(2) thin film produced almost a complete eradication of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells (initial concentration 10(8) cells mL(-1)) in 24 h compared to a 3-log reduction caused by UV-A light alone. In contrast, neither the photocatalytic treatment with TiO(2) film nor that with TiO(2) nanopowder had any effect on P. aeruginosa biofilms at all the interfaces investigated. Possible explanations for these findings, and for the discrepancy between this work and literature data, are discussed.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Aerobic degradation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene by individual bacterial strains and defined mixed population in submerged cultures.
AB  - The degradation efficiencies of isomeric mononitrotoluenes (2- and 4-NTs) and dinitrotoluenes (2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT) by either individual bacterial strains (Bacillus cereus NDT4, Pseudomonas putida NDT1, Pseudomonas fluorescens NDT2, and Achromobacter sp. NDT3) or their mixture were compared in submerged batch cultivations. The mixed culture degraded 2,4-DNT nearly 50 times faster than any of the individual strains. The mixed culture also demonstrated significantly shorter lag periods in 2,4-DNT degradation, a lack of nitrite or organic intermediates accumulation in the liquid medium and the ability to degrade a broader spectrum of nitrotoluenes over a wider concentration range. The presence of both readily degradable 2-NT (or 4-NT) and poorly degradable 2,6-DNT in the medium negatively affected 2,4-DNT biodegradation. However, the mixed bacterial culture still effectively degraded 2,4-DNT with only slightly lower rates under these unfavorable conditions, thus showing potential for the remediation of 2,4-DNT contaminated sites.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Antioxidant, antihypertensive and antimicrobial properties of ovine milk caseinate hydrolyzed with a microbial protease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioactive peptides might be released from precursor proteins through  enzymatic hydrolysis. These molecules could be potentially employed in health and food products. In this investigation, ovine milk caseinate hydrolysates obtained with a novel microbial protease derived from Bacillus sp. P7 were evaluated for antioxidant, antimicrobial, and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities. RESULTS: Antioxidant activity measured by the 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid method increased with hydrolysis time up to 2 h, remaining stable for up to 4 h. Hydrolysates showed low 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging abilities, with higher activity (31%) reached after 1 h of hydrolysis. Fe(2+) -chelating ability was maximum for 0.5 h hydrolysates (83.3%), decreasing thereafter; and the higher reducing power was observed after 1 h of hydrolysis. ACE-inhibitory activity was observed to increase up to 2 h of hydrolysis (94% of inhibition), declining afterwards. 3 h hydrolysates were shown to inhibit the growth of Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium fimi, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium expansum. CONCLUSION: Ovine caseinate hydrolyzed with Bacillus sp. P7 protease presented antioxidant, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial activities. Hydrolysis time was observed to affect the evaluated bioactivities. Such hydrolysates might have potential applications in the food industry.
TI  - Potential application of the nisin Z preparation of Lactococcus lactis W8 in preservation of milk.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin Z from Lactococcus lactis W8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees C were identified as Enterococcus italicus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter aerogenes. These bacteria were found to have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. Except Enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin Z preparation of the L. lactis W8. Addition of the nisin Z preparation to either the skim milk or fat milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log CFU ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. The nisin Z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. CONCLUSIONS: The nisin Z preparation from L. lactis W8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin Z preparation of L. lactis W8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin A). The nisin Z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.
TI  - Application of a continuously stirred tank bioreactor (CSTR) for bioremediation of hydrocarbon-rich industrial wastewater effluents.
AB  - A continuously stirred tank bioreactor (CSTR) was used to optimize feasible and reliable bioprocess system in order to treat hydrocarbon-rich industrial wastewaters. A successful bioremediation was developed by an efficient acclimatized microbial consortium. After an experimental period of 225 days, the process was shown to be highly efficient in decontaminating the wastewater. The performance of the bioaugmented reactor was demonstrated by the reduction of COD rates up to 95%. The residual total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) decreased from 320 mg TPH l(-1) to 8 mg TPH l(-1). Analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 26 hydrocarbons. The use of the mixed cultures demonstrated high degradation performance for hydrocarbons range n-alkanes (C10-C35). Six microbial isolates from the CSTR were characterized and species identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that 5 strains were closely related to Aeromonas punctata (Aeromonas caviae), Bacillus cereus, Ochrobactrum intermedium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Rhodococcus sp. The 6th isolate was affiliated to genera Achromobacter. Besides, the treated wastewater could be considered as non toxic according to the phytotoxicity test since the germination index of Lepidium sativum ranged between 57 and 95%. The treatment provided satisfactory results and presents a feasible technology for the treatment of hydrocarbon-rich wastewater from petrochemical industries and petroleum refineries.
TI  - [Biodiversity of mesophilic microbial community BYND-8 capability of lignocellulose degradation and its effect on biogas production].
AB  - The biodiversity of a mesophilic microbial community BYND-8 capable of degrading  lignocellulose at 30 degrees C was detected using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and the isolation of pure cultures, and the effect of the liquid of rice straw degradation by BYND-8 on biogas production was measured. Six bacterial strains were isolated using peptone cellulose solution medium, and the highest similarities of their 16S rDNA gene sequences to Serratia sp. PSGB 13, S. marcescens strain UFLA-25LS, S. marcescens strain DAP33, Alcaligenes sp. YcX-20, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain C6, Bacillus cereus isolate BRL02-71 were 99%, 100%, 96%, 100%, 100% and 99%, respectively. In addition, one band was detected besides six bands of cultured isolates on the DGGE gel, and it showed 100% sequence similarity to uncultured bacterium clone ATB-KS-1446. The cumulative biogas and methane productions of biogas fermentation system added with the liquid of rice straw degraded by BYND-8 were 13 167 mL and 7 248 mL, 44.5% and 95.3% higher than those of the control, respectively, in the early 15 days of fermentation. The results showed that the biodiversity of microbial community BYND-8 was very high, and the time of producing biogas was put forward and biogas production was increased with application of microbial community for rice straw pretreatment during the biogas fermentation.
TI  - Maklamicin, an antibacterial polyketide from an endophytic Micromonospora sp.
AB  - A new spirotetronate-class polyketide, maklamicin (1), was isolated from the culture extract of an endophytic actinomycete of the genus Micromonospora. The structure and relative configuration of 1 were elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined using the modified Mosher method. Maklamicin (1) showed strong to modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and characterization of thermotolerant manganese superoxide  dismutase from Bacillus sp. MHS47.
AB  - A superoxide dismutase gene from thermotolerant Bacillus sp. MHS47 (MnSOD47) was  cloned, sequenced, and expressed. The gene has an open reading frame of 612 bp, corresponding to 203 deduced amino acids, with high homology to the amino acid sequences of B. thuringiensis (accession no. EEN01322), B. anthracis (accession no. NP_846724), B. cereus (accession no. ZP_04187911), B. weihenstephanensis (accession no. YP_001646918), and B. pseudomycoides. The conserved manganese-binding sites (H28, H83, D165, and H169) show that MnSOD47 has the specific characteristics of the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) enzymes. MnSOD47 expressed an enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 22.65 kDa and a specific activity of 3537.75 U/mg. The enzyme is active in the pH range 7-8.5, with an optimum pH of 7.5, and at temperatures in the range 30-45 degrees C, with an optimum temperature of 37 degrees C. Tests of inhibitors and metal ions indicated that the enzyme activity is inhibited by sodium azide, but not by hydrogen peroxide or potassium cyanide. These data should benefit future studies of MnSODs in other microorganisms and the biotechnological production of MnSOD47, and could also be used to develop a biosensor for the detection of antioxidants and free radical activity. In the future, this basic knowledge could be applicable to the detection of cancer risks in humans and therapeutic treatments.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - A mixed-species microarray for identification of food spoilage bacilli.
AB  - Failure of food preservation is frequently caused by thermostable spores of members of the Bacillaceae family, which show a wide spectrum of resistance to cleaning and preservation treatments. We constructed and validated a mixed-species genotyping array for 6 Bacillus species, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus sporothermodurans, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus coagulans, and 4 Geobacillus species, including Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Geobacillus thermocatenulatus, Geobacillus toebii and Geobacillus sp., in order to track food spoilage isolates from ingredient to product. The discriminating power of the array was evaluated with sets of 42 reference and 20 test strains. Bacterial isolates contain a within-species-conserved core genome comprising 68-88% of the entire genome and a non-conserved accessory genome comprising 7-22%. The majority of the core genome markers do not hybridise between species, thus they allow for efficient discrimination at the species level. The accessory genome array markers provide high-resolution discrimination at the level of individual isolates from a single species. In conclusion, the reported mixed-species microarray contains discriminating markers that allow rapid and cost-effective typing of Bacillus food spoilage bacteria in a wide variety of food products.
TI  - Biodegradation of phenanthrene using adapted microbial consortium isolated from petrochemical contaminated environment.
AB  - In developing countries like India, there are many industrial areas discharging effluent containing large amount of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) which causes hazardous effect on the soil-water environment. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize high-efficiency PAH-degrading microbial consortium from 3 decade old petrochemical refinery field located in Nagpur, Maharashtra with history of PAH disposal. Based on biochemical tests and 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis the consortium was identified as Sphingobacterium sp., Bacillus cereus and a novel bacterium Achromobacter insolitus MHF ENV IV with effective phenanthrene-degrading ability. The biodegradation data of phenanthrene indicates about 100%, 56.9% and 25.8% degradation at the concentration of 100mg/l, 250 mg/l and 500 mg/l respectively within 14 days. The consortium and its monoculture isolates also utilized variety of other hydrocarbons for growth. To best of our knowledge this is the first time that Achromobacter insolitus has been reported to mineralize phenanthrene effectively. GC-MS analysis of phenanthrene degradation confirmed biodegradation by detection of intermediates like salicylaldehyde, salicylic acid and catechol. All the results indicated that the microbial consortium have a promising application in bioremediation of petrochemical contaminated environments and could be potentially useful for the study of PAH degradation and for bioremediation purposes.
TI  - Bacillus gaemokensis sp. nov., isolated from foreshore tidal flat sediment from the Yellow Sea.
AB  - A Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming organism, strain BL3-6(T), was isolated from tidal flat sediments of the Yellow Sea in the region of Tae-An. A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that this isolate belongs to the Bacillus cereus group, and is closely related to Bacillus mycoides (99.0% similarity), Bacillus thuringiensis (99.0%), Bacillus weihenstephanensis (99.0%), Bacillus cereus (98.9%), Bacillus anthracis (98.8%), and Bacillus pseudomycoides (98.1%). The phylogenetic distance from any validly described Bacillus species outside the Bacillus cereus group was less than 95.6%. The DNA G+C content of the strain was 39.4 mol% and the major respiratory quinone was menaquinone-7. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(14:0) (17.8%), iso-C(16:0) (15.8%), and iso-C(12:0) (11.3%). The diagnostic amino acid of the cell wall was meso-diaminopimelic acid and the major cell wall sugar was galactose. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization (<55.6%) and physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain BL3-6(T) from the published Bacillus species. BL3-6(T) therefore represents a new species, for which the name Bacillus gaemokensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain BL3-6(T) (=KCTC 13318(T) =JCM 15801(T)).
TI  - Isolation and identification of soil bacteria growing at the expense of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
AB  - Soil-microorganism symbioses are of fundamental importance for plant adaptation to the environment. Research in microbial ecology has revealed that some soil bacteria are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, these interactions may be much more complex than originally thought. To assess the type of bacteria associated with AMF, we initially isolated spores of Glomus irregulare from an Agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. The spores were washed with sterile water and plated onto G. irregulare mycelium growing in vitro in a root-free compartment of bicompartmented Petri dishes. We hypothesized that this system should select for bacteria closely associated with the fungus because the only nutrients available to the bacteria were those derived from the hyphae. Twenty-nine bacterial colonies growing on the AMF hyphae were subcultured and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequences. All bacterial isolates showed high sequence identity to Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus simplex, Kocuria rhizophila, Microbacterium ginsengisoli, Sphingomonas sp. and Variovorax paradoxus. We also assessed bacterial diversity on the surface of spores by PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. Finally, we used live cellular imaging to show that the bacteria isolated can grow on the surface of hyphae with different growing patterns in contrast to Escherichia coli as a control.
TI  - Biological Activities of a Mixture of Biosurfactant from Bacillus subtilis and Alkaline Lipase from Fusarium oxysporum.
AB  - In this study, we investigate the antimicrobial effects of a mixture of a biosurfactant from Bacillus subtilis and an alkaline lipase from Fusarium oxysporum (AL/BS mix) on several types of microorganisms, as well as their abilities to remove Listeria innocua ATCC 33093 biofilm from stainless steel coupons. The AL/BS mix had a surface tension of around 30 mN.m(-1), indicating that the presence of alkaline lipase did not interfere in the surface activity properties of the tensoactive component. The antimicrobial activity of the AL/BS mix was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) micro-assays. Among all the tested organisms, the presence of the mixture only affected the growth of B. subtilis CCT 2576, B. cereus ATCC 10876 and L. innocua. The most sensitive microorganism was B. cereus (MIC 0.013 mg.mL(-1)). In addition, the effect of the sanitizer against L. innocua attached to stainless steel coupons was determined by plate count after vortexing. The results showed that the presence of the AL/BS mix improved the removal of adhered cells relative to treatment done without the sanitizer, reducing the count of viable cells by 1.72 log CFU.cm(-2). However, there was no significant difference between the sanitizers tested and an SDS detergent standard (p<0.05).
TI  - Mercury resistance in Sporosarcina sp. G3.
AB  - Mercuric reductase (MerA) enzyme plays an important role in biogeochemical cycling and detoxification of Hg and recently, has also been shown to be useful in clean up of Hg-contaminated effluents. Present study describes isolation of a heavy metal-resistant isolate of Sporosarcina, which could tolerate up to 40, 525, 210, 2900 and 370 muM of Cd, Co, Zn, Cr and Hg respectively. It was found to reduce and detoxify redox-active metals like Cr and Hg. The chromate reductase and MerA activities in the crude cell extract of the culture were 1.5 and 0.044 units/mg protein respectively. The study also describes designing of a new set of highly degenerate primers based on a dataset of 23 Firmicute merA genes. As the primers encompass the known diversity of merA genes within the phylum Firmicutes, they can be very useful for functional diversity analysis. They were successfully used to amplify a 787 bp merA fragment from the current isolate. A 1174 bp merA fragment was further cloned by designing an additional downstream primer. It was found to show 92% similarity to the putative merA gene from Bacillus cereus AH820. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mercury resistance and merA gene sequence from Sporosarcina.
TI  - The effect of different growth regimes on the endophytic bacterial communities of the fern, Dicksonia sellowiana hook (Dicksoniaceae).
AB  - Endophytic bacteria associated with the fern Dicksonia sellowiana were investigated. The bacterial communities from the surface-sterilized pinnae and rachis segments of the plants from the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest that grew in native field conditions were compared with the bacterial communities from plants grown in greenhouses and plants that were initially grown in greenhouses and then transferred to the forest. From 540 pinnae and 540 rachis segments, 163 (30.2%) and 346 (64.2%) were colonized by bacteria, respectively. The main bacterial genera and species that were isolated included Bacillus spp. ( B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. pumilus and B. subtilis ) , Paenibacillus sp. , Amphibacillus sp. , Gracilibacillus sp. , Micrococcus sp. and Stenotrophomonas spp. ( S. maltophilia and S. nitroreducens ). B. pumilus was the most frequently isolated bacterial species . Amphibacillus and Gracilibacillus were reported as endophytes for the first time. Other commonly found bacterial genera were not observed in D. sellowiana , which may reflect preferences of specific bacterial communities inside this fern or detection limitations due to the isolation procedures. Plants that were grown in greenhouses and plants that were reintroduced into the forest displayed more bacterial genera and species diversity than native field plants, suggesting that reintroduction shifts the bacterial diversity. Endophytic bacteria that displayed antagonistic properties against different microorganisms were detected, but no obvious correlation was found between their frequencies with plant tissues or with plants from different growth regimes. This paper reports the first isolation of endophytic bacteria from a fern.
TI  - Biodegradation of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide by bacteria isolated from production water after polymer flooding in an oil field.
AB  - Partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) in production water after polymer flooding in oil filed causes environmental problems, such as increases the difficulty in oil-water separation, degrades naturally to produce toxic acrylamide and endanger local ecosystem. Biodegradation of HPAM may be an efficient way to solve these problems. The biodegradability of HPAM in an aerobic environment was studied. Two HPAM-degrading bacterial strains, named PM-2 and PM-3, were isolated from the produced water of polymer flooding. They were subsequently identified as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus sp., respectively. The utilization of HPAM by the two strains was explored. The amide group of HPAM could serve as a nitrogen source for the two microorganisms, the carbon backbone of these polymers could be partly utilized by microorganisms. The HPAM samples before and after bacterial biodegradation were analyzed by the infrared spectrum, high performance liquid chromatography and scanning electronic microscope. The results indicated that the amide group of HPAM in the biodegradation products had been converted to a carboxyl group, and no acrylamide monomer was found. The HPAM carbon backbone was metabolized by the bacteria during the course of its growth. Further more, the hypothesis about the biodegradation of HPAM in aerobic bacterial culture is proposed.
TI  - Characterization of an environmental strain of Bacillus thuringiensis from a hot  spring in Western Himalayas.
AB  - Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, is responsible for a serious and often fatal disease of mammalian livestock and humans and is an important biological warfare agent. Bacillus sp. AKG was isolated from a hot spring in western Himalayas and species-specific primers targeting gyrB gene identified the strain as B. anthracis within cereus-group. Cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis of the partial gyrB sequence from strain AKG indicated a close affiliation with B. anthracis and a few recently isolated strains of B. thuringiensis (e.g., strain Al Hakam and serovar konkukian). Phylogenetic analysis of two other housekeeping genes, clpC and gdpD yielded similar results. This observation is further substantiated by phylogenetic reconstruction using concatenated sequences (1680 bases) of the three genes (gyrB, clpC, and gdpD). Phenotypic features indicated a non-anthracis affiliation for the strain AKG. A novel strategy to distinguish among strains of B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis based on whole proteome comparison was developed and tested for the identification of this environmental strain. Proteome comparison was used to establish the identity of this unknown environmental strain. Group of replicate 2DE gels for whole cell proteome were generated for each of the three species and strain AKG. Protein spots unique to each group and those showing match between the groups, in a pair-wise comparison, indicated strain AKG as a member of B. thuringiensis. This strategy can be used to assign strains of B. cereus group to their respective species.
TI  - Bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in Manipur state of India.
AB  - Soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of Schizostachyum capitatum Munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in Manipur state of India. In this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), 16S rDNA sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This acidic starter (pH 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) together. The population distribution of dominant species were Bacillus subtilis 29.3%, Bacillus cereus 35.7%, Bacillus pumilus 2.6%, Lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, Lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, Carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, Enterococcus faecium 1.2% and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. Alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of B. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region and ITS-RFLP profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in B. subtilis, five subgroups in B. cereus and three subgroups in L. brevis isolates. The most abundant B. subtilis subgroup IB.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during RAPD analysis. The molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of Bacillus and LAB distributed in most of the starter samples. These dominant strains of B. subtilis, L. brevis and L. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.
TI  - The chemical constituents of endophytic fungus Trichoderma sp. MFF-1.
AB  - A fungal strain named MFF-1 was isolated from the flower of Pyrethrum cinerariifolium. Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, this strain was identified as a Trichoderma sp. Two new compounds, including a mitorubrin derivative and its potential biogenetic precursor, together with a known compound, were isolated from the cultures of the endophytic fungus. Their structures were established by spectroscopic methods and determined to be (3S*,6R*,7R*)-3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-7-hydroxy-7-methyl-8-oxo-3-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]- 1H-isochromen-6-yl 2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoate (1), named deacetylisowortmin, (E)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(2-hydroxypent-3-enyl)phenol (2), and wortmannin (3). All compounds were assayed for antimicrobial activity. Compound 3 showed activity against Candida albicans and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the methylene chloride extract of Miconia ligustroides, isolated triterpene acids, and ursolic acid derivatives.
AB  - The methylene chloride extract of Miconia ligustroides (DC.) Naudin (Melastomataceae), the isolated compounds ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of these acids, and ursolic acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579), Vibrio cholerae (ATCC 9458), Salmonella choleraesuis (ATCC 10708), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 10031), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305). The microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. The methylene chloride extract showed no activity against the selected microorganisms. Ursolic acid was active against B. cereus, showing a MIC value of 20 microg/mL. Oleanolic acid was effective against B. cereus and S. pneumoniae with a MIC of 80 microg/mL in both cases. The mixture of triterpenes, ursolic and oleanolic acids, did not enhance the antimicrobial activity. However, the acetyl and methyl ester derivatives, prepared from ursolic acid, increased the inhibitory activity for S. pneumoniae.
TI  - A subset of naturally isolated Bacillus strains show extreme virulence to the free-living nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus.
AB  - The main food source of free-living nematodes in the soil environment is bacteria, which can affect nematode development, fecundity and survival. In order to occupy a reliable source of bacterial food, some nematodes have formed specific relationships with an array of invertebrate hosts (where bacteria proliferate once the hosts dies), thus forming a tritrophic system of nematode, bacteria and insect or other invertebrates. We isolated 768 Bacillus strains from soil (from Germany and the UK), horse dung and dung beetles and fed them to the genetically tractable free-living nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus to isolate nematocidal strains. While C. elegans is a bacteriovorous soil nematode, P. pacificus is an omnivorous worm that is often found in association with scarab beetles. We found 20 Bacillus strains (consisting of B. cereus, B. weihenstephanensis, B. mycoides and Bacillus sp.) that were pathogenic to C. elegans and P. pacificus causing 70% to 100% mortality over 5 days and significantly affect development and brood size. The most pathogenic strains are three B. cereus-like strains isolated from dung beetles, which exhibit extreme virulence to C. elegans in less than 24 h, but P. pacificus remains resistant. C. elegans Bre mutants were also highly susceptible to the B. cereus-like strains indicating that their toxins use a different virulence mechanism than B. thuringiensis Cry 5B toxin. Also, mutations in the daf-2/daf-16 insulin signaling pathway do not rescue survival. We profiled the toxin genes (bcet, nhe complex, hbl complex, pcpl, sph, cytK, piplc, hly2, hly3, entFM and entS) of these three B. cereus-like strains and showed presence of most toxin genes but absence of the hbl complex. Taken together, this study shows that the majority of naturally isolated Bacillus from soil, horse dung and Geotrupes beetles are benign to both C. elegans and P. pacificus. Among 20 pathogenic strains with distinct virulence patterns against the two nematodes, we selected three B. cereus-like strains to investigate resistance and susceptibility immune responses in nematodes.
TI  - Purification and characterization of chitinase from a new species strain Pseudomonas sp. TKU008.
AB  - The chitinase producing strain TKU008 was isolated from the soil in Taiwan, and it was identified as a new species of Pseudomonas. The culture condition suitable for production of chitinase was found to be shaken at 30 degrees C for 4 days in 100 mL of medium containing 1% shrimp and crab shell powder, 0.1 % K2HPO4 and 0.05% MgSO4 . 7 H2O (pH 7). The TKU008 chitinase was suppressed by the simultaneously existing protease, which also showed the maximum activity at the forth day of incubation. The molecular mass of the chitinase was estimated to be 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH, optimum temperature, pH stability, and thermal stability of the chitinase were pH 7, 50 degrees C, pH 6-7, and 50 degrees C, respectively. The chitinase was completely inhibited by Mn2+ and Cu2+. The results of peptide mass mapping showed that eleven tryptic peptides of the chitinase were identical to a chitinase CW from Bacillus cereus (GenBank accession number gi 45827175) with a 32 % sequence coverage.
TI  - Comparative assessment of selenite (SeIV) detoxification to elemental selenium (Se0) by Bacillus sp.
AB  - Bacillus licheniformis, B. subtilis, B. cereus, Bacillus pumilus and Exiguobacterium sp., which were resistant up to 20 mg Na(2)SeO(3)/ml in nutrient broth and 40 mg/ml on nutrient agar plates, were isolated from contaminated soil and water. They grew from 25 to 45 degrees C and pH 5 to 9. They had multiple metal and antibiotic resistances. All strains reduced selenite (SeIV) to elemental selenium (Se0) aerobically with a maximum reduction of 97% by B. pumilus after 144 h with Na(2)SeO(3) at 500 microg/ml.
TI  - Bisphenol A removal by the Dracaena plant and the role of plant-associating bacteria.
AB  - Dracaena sanderiana and Dracaena fragrans plants, as representatives of native, tropical, evergreen plants with fibrous root systems, were evaluated for bisphenol A (BPA) tolerance and uptake capability. D. sanderiana demonstrated significantly higher BPA removal capability than D. fragrans. Therefore, it was chosen for further study. D. sanderiana tolerated BPA toxicity levels up to 80 microM, while higher BPA concentrations damaged the plant. In the sterile hydroponic system with an initial BPA concentration of 20 microM, the plant could uptake approximately 50% of the BPA. The plant's ability to translocate BPA was confirmed by the detection of BPA that accumulated at the roots and stems, but not at the leaves of the plant. Upon BPA exposure, the D. sanderiana secreted extracellular plant mucilage as a protective barrier to the toxic compound. In the non-sterile treatment, the BPA dissipation was contributed not only by the D. sanderiana plant, but also by the co-existing microbes. The BPA reached 85% of the initial concentration at 20 microM. Among the six plant-associating bacterial isolates, Bacillus cereus strain BPW4 and Enterobacter sp. strain BPW5 colonized the D. sanderiana root surface and facilitated BPA dissipation in the hydroponic treatment system. In addition, the success of the BPA treatment in the hazardous waste landfill leachate demonstrated the potential application of D. sanderiana plant in the phytoremediation of BPA contaminated wastewater or industrial leachate.
TI  - A new prenylated flavanoid with antibacterial activity from propolis collected in Egypt.
AB  - A novel prenylated flavanoid, isonymphaeol-D (1), together with two known compounds, isonymphaeol-B (2) and nymphaeol-B (3), were isolated from Egyptian propolis. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by various spectroscopic methods. 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative strains (Serratia sp., Pseudomonos sp., Escherichia coli).
TI  - The swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (StAsp-PSI) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  - Plant-specific insert domain (PSI) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (AP) precursors. PSI is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the N- and C-terminal portions of the saposin like domain. Hence, PSI is called a swaposin domain. Here, we report the cloned, heterologous expression and purification of PSI from StAsp 1 (Solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called StAsp-PSI. Results obtained here show that StAsp-PSI is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. As reported for StAPs (S. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the StAsp-PSI ability to kill microbial pathogens is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. Additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the SAPLIP family, StAsp-PSI and StAPs are cytotoxic to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The amino acid residues conserved in SP_B (pulmonary surfactant protein B) and StAsp-PSI could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by StAsp-PSI and StAPs against Gram-positive bacteria. These results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the PSI domain in mature StAPs could be related to their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  MPa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees C for up to 35 days. Weissella viridescens was found to be the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 MPa. None of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the Weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. Studies on a typical W. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 MPa. Agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including strains of Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. The selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this Weissella sp. could be advantageous in extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.
TI  - Isolation, structure elucidation and biological activity of angucycline antibiotics from an epiphytic yew streptomycete.
AB  - In the course of study of epiphytic microorganisms occurring on the surface of roots of Taxus baccata L. a new strain Streptomyces sp. AC113 was isolated. According to 16S ribosomal DNA-based identification the new strain is 99% identical with Streptomyces flavidofuscus. This strain cultivated in an arginine glycerol medium produced three major metabolites identified as (-)-8-O -methyltetrangomycin (1), 8-O -methyltetrangulol (2) and 8-O -methyl-7-deoxo-7-hydroxytetrangomycin (3). The chemical structures of these angucyclines were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR as well as by mass spectrometry. Isolated angucycline metabolites showed significant antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Listeria mocytogenes. Cytotoxic activities of compounds 1, 2 and 3 against four cell lines (B16, HT-29 and non - tumor V79, L929) were evaluated. Compound 3 was the most potent anticancer agents with IC(50) 0.054 microg/ml against cell line B16.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus Faecium Fair-E 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus faecium FAIR-E 198 against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by E. faecium FAIR-E 198 inhibited all L. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 AU mL(-1)). However, none of the B. cereus and S. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. The maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 AU mL(-1)) was observed in MRS broth, while the activity in milk was 100 AU mL(-1). In the co-cultivation test in milk, B. cereus K1-B041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log CFU mL(-1)) after 48 h. E. faecium reduced the initial L. monocytogenes Scott A population by 1 log CFU mL(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees C, However, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log CFU mL(-1) after 48 h. E. faecium did not influence the growth of S. aureus ATCC 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, Therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of E. faecium FAIR-E 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of hyper phenol tolerant Bacillus sp. from oil refinery and exploration sites.
AB  - Bacillus cereus MTCC 9817 strain AKG1 and B. cereus MTCC 9818 strain AKG2 were isolated from petroleum refinery and oil exploration site, respectively. The 16S rDNA sequence of strain AKG1 showed the closest relation to B. cereus 99.63% and Bacillus coagulans 99.63% followed by 99.34% homology with Bacillus thuringiensis strain 2PR56-10. AKG2 is mostly related to B. thuringiensis strain CMG 861 with 99.37% homology. The similarity search between AKG1 and AKG2 gave the lowest similarity 99.19% among same genus similar sequences. At phenol concentration of 1000 mg/L, the optimum growth conditions for AKG1 were found to be 37 degrees C and pH 7.0 and the same were found to be 37 degrees C and pH 7.5 for AKG2. The growth kinetics of the strains AKG1 and AKG2 are best fitted by Yano model (maximum growth rate, mu(max)=1.024 h(-1) and inhibition constant, K(I)=171,800 mg/L) and Edward model (mu(max)=0.5969 h(-1) and K(I)=1483 mg/L) respectively. Growth kinetics of both the strains are also well fitted by the Haldane model with mu(max)=0.4396 h(-1) and K(I)=637.8 mg/L for AKG1 and mu(max)=0.9332 h(-1) and K(I)=494.4 mg/L for AKG2.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Characterization of corrosive bacterial consortia isolated from petroleum-product-transporting pipelines.
AB  - Microbiologically influenced corrosion is a problem commonly encountered in facilities in the oil and gas industries. The present study describes bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines located in the northwest and southwest region in India, using traditional cultivation technique and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of the isolates was carried out, and the samples obtained from the diesel and naphtha-transporting pipelines showed the occurrence of 11 bacterial species namely Serratia marcescens ACE2, Bacillus subtilis AR12, Bacillus cereus ACE4, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AI1, Klebsiella oxytoca ACP, Pseudomonas stutzeri AP2, Bacillus litoralis AN1, Bacillus sp., Bacillus pumilus AR2, Bacillus carboniphilus AR3, and Bacillus megaterium AR4. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from both pipelines. The dominant bacterial species identified in the petroleum pipeline samples were B. cereus and S. marcescens in the diesel and naphtha pipelines, respectively. Therefore, several types of bacteria may be involved in biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in industrial facilities. In addition, localized (pitting) corrosion of the pipeline steel in the presence of the consortia was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The potential role of each species in biofilm formation and steel corrosion is discussed.
TI  - New cyclopentenones from strain Trichoderma sp. YLF-3.
AB  - Two new cyclopentenones, trichodermone A (1) and trichodermone B (2), together with a known compound, 3-(3-oxocyclopent-1-enyl) propanoic acid (3), were isolated from the strain Trichoderma sp. YLF-3. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of their spectroscopic data. All compounds were assayed for antibacterial activity. Compound 3 showed activity against Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - New approach for the detection of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes in Bacillus strains by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacillus strains produce non-ribosomal lipopeptides that can be grouped into three families: surfactins or lichenysins, iturins and fengycins or plispastatins. These biosurfactants show a broad spectrum of biological activities. To detect strains able to produce these lipopeptides, a new polymerase chain reaction screening approach was developed using degenerated primers based on the intraoperon alignment of adenylation and thiolation nucleic acid domains of all enzymes implicated in the biosynthesis of each lipopeptide family. The comparative bioinformatics analyses of each operon led to the design of four primer pairs for the three families taking into account the differences between open reading frames of each synthetase gene. Tested on different Bacillus sp. strains, this technique was used successfully to detect not only the expected genes in the lipopeptide producing strains but also the presence of a plispastatin gene in Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 and a gene showing a high similarity with the polyketide synthase type I gene in the B. subtilis ATCC 6633 genome. It also led to the discovery of the presence of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes in Bacillus thuringiensis serovar berliner 1915 and in Bacillus cereus LMG 2098. In addition, this work highlighted the differences between the fengycin and plipastatin operon at DNA level.
TI  - Growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: Effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  - Simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit (PMEU) linked with ChemPro100i((R)) gas detector. The effects of vancomycin were evaluated in aerobic cultures. Growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, pH alterations, and colony counts on BD CHROMagar Orientation plates. Results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, Escherichia coli E 17 and Klebsiella mobilis ATCC 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus. When the evaporations of the mixed cultures of E. coli, K. mobilis and S. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by ChemPro100i((R)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant E. coli and K. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. A survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big University Hospital, (Salzburg, Austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. Only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). Enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). In anaerobiosis it was shown that Klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the E. coli. The ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in the gas stream of the PMEU culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. The synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter strains is suggested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  - Lactobacillus spp., referred to as IJ-1 and IJ-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. According to the analyses of 16S rDNA sequence, Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 showed greater than 99% homology with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T), and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 had greater than 99% homology with the L. gasseri ATCC 33323(T) and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200(T). The pH changes in the culture media of Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. Their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. Neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. Both strains inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Salmonella enterica KCTC 12401, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 3881, and Bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Survey of bacterial populations present in US-produced linerboard with high recycle content.
AB  - AIMS: To survey paperboard products from 17 US mills for bacterial populations and for bacteria potentially harmful to human health. METHODS AND RESULTS: Culturable aerobic bacteria were isolated from paperboard products using selective and nonselective medium. Resulting colonies from samples from three regions of the United States were identified using fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Percentages of bacteria species found were Bacillus megaterium (47), Bacillus licheniformis (15), Bacillus pumilus (12), Paenibacillus macerans (5), Paenibacillus pabuli (3), Bacillus subtilis (2), Bacillus cereus (2), Bacillus coagulans (1), Bacillus circulans (1), Bacillus brevis (1), Bacillus thuringiensis (1), Paenibacillus polymyxa (1), Cellulomonas turbata (1), Cellulomonas flavigena (1), unidentified Bacillus sp. (3) and unidentified bacteria (1). CONCLUSIONS: Recycled paperboard contained high populations of bacteria, and a positive correlation was found between recycle content and bacterial populations. Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella or confirmed coliform bacteria were not found in any product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Populations of bacteria did not differ significantly from original counts over a 4-month period of dry storage, indicating that bacteria persist in paperboard over long periods and may re-enter the recycling process. The predominance of heat-tolerant endospore-forming bacteria explains the high bacteria counts found in paperboard made from recycled materials.
TI  - [Identification of a fibrinolytic enzyme producing Bacillus pseudomycoides and purification and characterization of the enzyme].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify a single fibrinolytic enzyme from Bacillus pseudomycoides B-60 and to determine its N-terminal sequence and to characterize the fibrinolytic enzyme. METHODS: We examined the fibrinolytic enzyme activity by fibrin plate and purified fibrinolytic enzyme by ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation and DEAE anion exchange chromatography. RESULTS: Obtained a single protein fraction with fibrinolytic activity (BpFE) from B. pseudomycoides B-60. It appeared as a single band in the SDS-PAGE with a relative molecular weight of 34 kDa. The fibrinolytic activity of the protein was stable at 4-50 degrees C and at pH 5-10. The activity sharply decreased above 50 degrees C, and the total loss of activity at pH 3.0. The enzymatic activity was slightly enhanced by the ions of Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, whereas strongly inhibited by Cu2+ ion. Phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) could completely inhibit its activity. In addition, the activity improved when the protein was enzymatically hydrolyzed using trypsin and pepsin. The first 15 amino acids of the N-terminal sequence of the enzyme were determined to be VTGTNAVGTGKGVLG. The partial amino acids sequence alignment study of the enzyme from B-60 strain with bacillolysin, neutral protease and hydrolase which were from B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis and Lactobacillus sp. was carried out, and there is a 100% homogeneity between them. CONCLUSION: We obtained a single fibrinolytic enzyme. Through its N-terminal sequence alignment study, a plasmin with high homogeneity to this protein was not found yet. This provided a basis for further study of new thrombolytic drugs.
TI  - Molecular analysis of endophytic bacteria from the genus Bacillus isolated from tropical maize (Zea mays L.).
AB  - Endophytic bacteria play an important role in agriculture by improving plant performance and adaptation against biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study molecular methods were used for identifying Bacillus endophytic bacteria isolated from Brazilian sweet corn. SDS-PAGE of whole-cell protein extract of forty-two isolates revealed a high number of scrutinable bands. Twenty-four isolates were identified in nine different groups of duplicated bacteria and eighteen were identified as unique. Some high-accumulated polipeptides with variable length were observed in almost isolates. Partial sequencing of 16S ribosomal gene revealed that all isolates are Bacillus sp. and among thirteen isolates with similar protein profiles, two were different strains. Among the forty-two isolates identified by rDNA sequencing, Bacillus subitilis and B. pumilus were the most frequenty species (15 and 12 isolates, respectively) followed by B. licheniformes (7 isolates), B. cereus (5 isolates) and B. amiloliquefascens (3 isolates). According to present results, SDS-PAGE technique could be used as a fast and cheap first tool for identifying inter-specific variation in maize endophytic bacterial collections while rDNA sequencing could be applied for analyzing intra-specific variation among isolates with similar protein profile as well as for taxonomic studies.
TI  - Physiological traits of the symbiotic bacterium Teredinibacter turnerae isolated  from the mangrove shipworm Neoteredo reynei.
AB  - Nutrition in the Teredinidae family of wood-boring mollusks is sustained by cellulolytic/nitrogen fixing symbiotic bacteria of the Teredinibacter clade. The mangrove Teredinidae Neoteredo reynei is popularly used in the treatment of infectious diseases in the north of Brazil. In the present work, the symbionts of N. reynei, which are strictly confined to the host's gills, were conclusively identified as Teredinibacter turnerae. Symbiont variants obtained in vitro were able to grow using casein as the sole carbon/nitrogen source and under reduced concentrations of NaCl. Furthermore, cellulose consumption in T. turnerae was clearly reduced under low salt concentrations. As a point of interest, we hereby report first hand that T. turnerae in fact exerts antibiotic activity. Furthermore, this activity was also affected by NaCl concentration. Finally, T. turnerae was able to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, this including strains of Sphingomonas sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus sciuri. Our findings introduce new points of view on the ecology of T. turnerae, and suggest new biotechnological applications for this marine bacterium.
TI  - Intergeneric coaggregation of non-flocculating Acinetobacter spp. isolates with other sludge-constituting bacteria.
AB  - The ability of non-flocculating Acinetobacter spp. isolates (A. johnsonii S35 and A. junii S33) to coaggregate with other sludge-constituting bacteria obtained from a sewage sludge sample was assessed by a spectrophotometric assay. A. johnsonii S35 showed significant coaggregation (aggregation index (AI)=70 to 99%) with 7 strains, Bacillus cereus, Blastomonas natatoria, Mycobacterium sp., Thermomonas brevis, and Enterobacteriaceae family, identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. A. junii S33 coaggregated with 4 strains, which were also coaggregating partners of A. johnsonii S35, as indicated by AI values of 59-93%. The microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon (MATH) assay showed that both A. johnsonii S35 and A. junii S33 possess a hydrophobic character as indicated by their relative cell surface hydrophobicity (RCSH), 88 and 61%, respectively. A good correlation was observed between the degree of coaggregation of the Acinetobacter spp. isolates and the RCSH of their partner strains. The cells of an A. johnsonii S35 spontaneous mutant and A. johnsonii IAM1517, which had a hydrophilic cell surface, did not coaggregate with the other examined isolates. These results demonstrated that hydrophobic interaction plays an important role in the intergeneric coaggregation of Acinetobacter spp. isolates with other sludge-constituting bacteria.
TI  - Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by Lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
AB  - AIMS: Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain, isolated from Argentinian dry-fermented sausage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. It was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the pH range from 5.0 to 6.0. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. It was purified by RP (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and RP-HPLC. Plantaricin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 Da as determined by Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. It was shown to have a bactericidal effect against Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriocin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In view of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic pH), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.
TI  - Characterization and identification of a novel marine Streptomyces sp. produced antibacterial substance.
AB  - Strain GB-2 is a marine microbe with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, isolated from soil taken from the coastal city Lianyungang in the JiangSu province of China. Analysis of its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics as well as chemical components of the cell wall strongly suggested that the strain GB-2 belonged to the Streptomyces sp. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of Streptomyces sp. GB-2 strain showed a strong similarity (98%) with the 16 rRNA gene of Streptomyces fradiae. Application to antibacterial substance of strain Streptomyces sp. GB-2 by various separation steps led to isolation of one active molecule having a retention time of 9.495 min, P(9.495 min), which possessed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Through analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass/mass spectrometry of the peak, the molecular weight of the antibacterial substance (P(9.495 min) sample) was 447.5 Da and it was determined to be sisomicin according to the analysis of ion fragments. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the peak also demonstrated that the antibacterial substance was sisomicin. This study is the first to introduce the finding of sisomicin produced from marine Streptomyces sp. This work provides a preference for the production of sisomicin in pharmaceutical industries and a probability for studying the biodiversity of marine microbe.
TI  - Phylogeny in aid of the present and novel microbial lineages: diversity in Bacillus.
AB  - Bacillus represents microbes of high economic, medical and biodefense importance. Bacillus strain identification based on 16S rRNA sequence analyses is invariably limited to species level. Secondly, certain discrepancies exist in the segregation of Bacillus subtilis strains. In the RDP/NCBI databases, out of a total of 2611 individual 16S rDNA sequences belonging to the 175 different species of the genus Bacillus, only 1586 have been identified up to species level. 16S rRNA sequences of Bacillus anthracis (153 strains), B. cereus (211 strains), B. thuringiensis (108 strains), B. subtilis (271 strains), B. licheniformis (131 strains), B. pumilus (83 strains), B. megaterium (47 strains), B. sphaericus (42 strains), B. clausii (39 strains) and B. halodurans (36 strains) were considered for generating species-specific framework and probes as tools for their rapid identification. Phylogenetic segregation of 1121, 16S rDNA sequences of 10 different Bacillus species in to 89 clusters enabled us to develop a phylogenetic frame work of 34 representative sequences. Using this phylogenetic framework, 305 out of 1025, 16S rDNA sequences presently classified as Bacillus sp. could be identified up to species level. This identification was supported by 20 to 30 nucleotides long signature sequences and in silico restriction enzyme analysis specific to the 10 Bacillus species. This integrated approach resulted in identifying around 30% of Bacillus sp. up to species level and revealed that B. subtilis strains can be segregated into two phylogenetically distinct groups, such that one of them may be renamed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some macrophytes from Lake Manzalah (Egypt).
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of aqueous and organic solvents (chloroform, ethanol and methanol) extracts of four plants Ceratophyllum demersum L., Eichhornia crassipes, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton pectinatus were tested in vitro against seventeen different microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Nine of these identified organisms were obtained from different sources, Bacillus subtilis 1020, Bacillus cereus 1080, Staphylococcus aureus, Erwinia carotovora NCPPB 312, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. The other eight organisms were isolated from Manzalah lake water and identified using API 20E strip system (BioMereux). One hundred pathogenic bacterial isolates representing eight genera were identified to species level. These organisms are Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Salmonella colerasuis (13%), Shigella sp. (11%), Serratia liquefaciens (10%), Proteus vulgaris (9%) and Brenneria nigrifluens (7%). The extracts of all tested plants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the used organisms. The efficiency of the extracts varied with, solvent used in the extraction as well as plant species and the part of plant used. The aqueous extract appeared to be the highly effective extract against all tested organisms especially Fusarium oxysporum causing inhibition zone 48 +/- 0.01 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 +/- 0.02 mm and Salmonella cholerasuis 55 +/- 0.01 mm when using P. crispus, P. pectinatus and C. demersum, respectively. Ethanol extracts of C. demersum, P. crispus and E. crassipes root showed antimicrobial activities against all tested organisms except Aspergillus niger. At the same time the extract of P. pectinatus had no effect also on Fusarium oxysporum and the extract of E. crassipes leaves have no effect on Penicillium italicum. On using chloroform extracts Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum showed resistance. Comparing the effect of different plants extracts C. demersum appeared to be the most effective followed by P. pectinatus. Furthermore, the extracts of E. crassipes leaves being more effective than that, of its roots. Elemental analysis were also takes place in water and plant samples and the results revealed the presence of Mn and Pb in higher concentration in P. pectinatus (Mn 603 +/- 4.243 ppm and Pb 44 +/- 2.828 ppm), at the same time the highest values of Fe 1680 +/- 2.2 ppm, Zn 31.5 +/- 2.1 ppm and Cu 26.5 +/- 2.1 ppm were recorded for C. demersum. Comparing the two parts of E. crassipes (leaves and roots), the roots have the highest values of all studied metals.
TI  - Mercury stable isotope fractionation during reduction of Hg(II) by different microbial pathways.
AB  - Mercury (Hg) stable isotope fractionation has recently been developed as a tool in biogeochemistry. In this study, the extent of Hg stable isotope fractionation during reduction of ionic mercury [Hg(II)] by two Hg(II)-resistant strains, Bacillus cereus 5 and the thermophile Anoxybacillus sp. FB9 [which actively detoxify Hg(II) by the mer system] and a Hg(II)-sensitive metal-reducing anaerobe, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [which reduces Hg(II) at low concentrations], was investigated. In all cases, barring suppression of fractionation that is likely due to lower Hg(II) bioavailability, the Hg(II) remaining in the reactor became progressively enriched with heavy isotopes with time and underwent mass-dependent Rayleigh fractionation with alpha202/198 values of 1.0016 +/- 0.0004 (1 SD). Based on a multistep framework for the Hg(II) reduction pathways in the three strains, we constrain the processes that could contribute toward fractionation and suggest that for Hg(II)-resistant strains, reduction by mercuric reductase is the primary step causing fractionation. The proposed framework helps explain the variation in the extent of Hg stable isotope fractionation during microbial reduction of Hg(II), furthering the promise of Hg isotope ratios as a tool in determining the role of microbial Hg transformations in the environment.
TI  - Spontaneous fermentation of traditional sago starch in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Sago starch is an important dietary carbohydrate in lowland Papua New Guinea (PNG). An investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes play a role in its preservation using traditional methods. In 12 stored sago samples collected from PNG villages, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were present (> or = 3.6 x 10(4)cfu/g) and pH ranged from 6.8 to 4.2. Acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and valeric acids were present in six or more. In freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees C, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of sago starch was observed. This was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and pH reducing from 4.9 to 3.1: both LAB and yeasts were involved. Survival of potential bacterial pathogens was monitored by seeding sago starch with approximately 10(4)/g of selected organisms. Numbers of Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus fell to < 30/g within 7 days. Salmonella sp. was present only in low numbers after 7 days (< 36/g), but Escherichia coli was still detectable after three weeks (> 10(2)/g). Fermentation appeared to increase the storability and safety of the product.
TI  - Improvement of plant growth and nickel uptake by nickel resistant-plant-growth promoting bacteria.
AB  - In this study, among a collection of Ni-resistant bacterial strains isolated from the rhizosphere of Alyssum serpyllifolium and Phleum phleoides grown on serpentine soil, five plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) were selected based on their ability to utilize 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) as the sole N source and promote seedling growth. All of the strains tested positive for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production and phosphate solubilization. In addition, four of the strains exhibited significant levels of siderophores production. Further, the efficiency of PGPB in enhancing Ni solubilization in soils was analyzed. Compared with control treatment, inoculation of PGPB strains significantly increased the concentrations of bioavailable Ni. Furthermore, a pot experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of inoculating Ni-resistant PGPB on the plant growth and the uptake of Ni by Brassica juncea and B. oxyrrhina in soil contaminated with 450 mg kg(-1) Ni. Psychrobacter sp. SRA2 significantly increased the fresh (351%) and dry biomass (285%) of the B. juncea test plants (p<0.05), whereas Psychrobacter sp. SRA1 and Bacillus cereus SRA10 significantly increased the accumulation of Ni in the root and shoot tissues of B. juncea compared with non-inoculated controls. This result indicates that the strains SRA1 and SRA10 facilitated the release of Ni from the non-soluble phases in the soil, thus enhancing the availability of Ni to plants. A significant increase, greater than that of the control, was also noted for growth parameters of the B. oxyrrhina test plants when the seeds were treated with strain SRA2. This effect can be attributed to the utilization of ACC, solubilization of phosphate and production of IAA. The results of the study revealed that the inoculation of Ni mobilizing strains Psychrobacter sp. SRA1 and B. cereus SRA10 increases the efficiency of phytoextraction directly by enhancing the metal accumulation in plant tissues and the efficient PGPB, Psychrobacter sp. SRA2 increases indirectly by promoting the growth of B. juncea and B. oxyrrhina.
TI  - Efficiency of KrCl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the killing efficiency of UV KrCl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) were treated by KrCl excilamp in sterile Ringer's solution with and without H(2)O(2). The number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 h. At estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) CFU ml(-1) E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100% disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mJ cm(-2)). Bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to UV treatment than B. cereus. The UV/H(2)O(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for UV treatment alone. No effect of H(2)O(2) was observed at 10(7) CFU ml(-1) for Bacillus sp. and Strep. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The narrow-band UV radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: KrCl excilamps represent UV sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.
TI  - Biodegradation of phenol in batch culture by pure and mixed strains of Paenibacillus sp. and Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The bacterial strains, Paenibacillus sp. (AY952466) and Bacillus cereus (DQ002384), have proven capacity to degrade lignin and pentachlorophenol. In the present study, both strains were screened at different concentrations of phenol on mineral salt agar medium in the presence of glucose. At optimized condition (pH 7.5 +/- 0.2, 37 +/- 1 degrees C, 120 rpm, 1% glucose w/v), it was observed that both Paenibacillus sp., B. cereus and its mixed culture degraded phenol (500 mg/l) up to 53.86%, 91.63% and 67.76% within 168 h of incubation, respectively. Phenol degradation was routinely monitored spectrophotometrically and further confirmed by HPLC. Catechol and 2-hydroxy muconic semialdehyde were identified as intermediate products from degraded samples using GC-MS. It was also observed that, in the absence of glucose, bacterial strains were unable to utilize phenol indicating the phenomenon of co-metabolism.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid from an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont  of Amoeba proteus.
AB  - A new cryptic plasmid pAP3.9 was discovered in symbiotic alpha-proteobacteria present in the cytoplasm of Amoeba proteus. The plasmid is 3869bp with a GC content of 34.66% and contains replication origins for both double-strand (dso) and single-strand (sso). It has three putative ORFs encoding Mob, Rep and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGPase). The pAP3.9 plasmid appears to propagate by the conjugative rolling-circle replication (RCR), since it contains all required factors such as Rep, sso and dso. Mob and Rep showed highest similarities to those of the cryptic plasmid pBMYdx in Bacillus mycoides. The PGPase was homologous to that of Bacillus cereus and formed a clade with those of Bacillus sp. in molecular phylogeny. These results imply that the pAP3.9 plasmid evolved by the passage through Bacillus species. We hypothesize that the plasmid-encoded PGPase may have contributed to the establishment of bacterial symbiosis within the hostile environment of amoeba cytoplasm.
TI  - Induced Systemic Resistance and Promotion of Plant Growth by Bacillus spp.
AB  - ABSTRACT Elicitation of induced systemic resistance (ISR) by plant-associated bacteria was initially demonstrated using Pseudomonas spp. and other gram-negative bacteria. Several reviews have summarized various aspects of the large volume of literature on Pseudomonas spp. as elicitors of ISR. Fewer published accounts of ISR by Bacillus spp. are available, and we review this literature for the first time. Published results are summarized showing that specific strains of the species B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, B. pasteurii, B. cereus, B. pumilus, B. mycoides, and B. sphaericus elicit significant reductions in the incidence or severity of various diseases on a diversity of hosts. Elicitation of ISR by these strains has been demonstrated in greenhouse or field trials on tomato, bell pepper, muskmelon, watermelon, sugar beet, tobacco, Arabidopsis sp., cucumber, loblolly pine, and two tropical crops (long cayenne pepper and green kuang futsoi). Protection resulting from ISR elicited by Bacillus spp. has been reported against leaf-spotting fungal and bacterial pathogens, systemic viruses, a crown-rotting fungal pathogen, root-knot nematodes, and a stem-blight fungal pathogen as well as damping-off, blue mold, and late blight diseases. Reductions in populations of three insect vectors have also been noted in the field: striped and spotted cucumber beetles that transmit cucurbit wilt disease and the silver leaf whitefly that transmits Tomato mottle virus. In most cases, Bacillus spp. that elicit ISR also elicit plant growth promotion. Studies on mechanisms indicate that elicitation of ISR by Bacillus spp. is associated with ultrastructural changes in plants during pathogen attack and with cytochemical alterations. Investigations into the signal transduction pathways of elicited plants suggest that Bacillus spp. activate some of the same pathways as Pseudomonas spp. and some additional pathways. For example, ISR elicited by several strains of Bacillus spp. is independent of salicylic acid but dependent on jasmonic acid, ethylene, and the regulatory gene NPR1-results that are in agreement with the model for ISR elicited by Pseudomonas spp. However, in other cases, ISR elicited by Bacillus spp. is dependent on salicylic acid and independent of jasmonic acid and NPR1. In addition, while ISR by Pseudomonas spp. does not lead to accumulation of the defense gene PR1 in plants, in some cases, ISR by Bacillus spp. does. Based on the strains and results summarized in this review, two products for commercial agriculture have been developed, one aimed mainly at plant growth promotion for transplanted vegetables and one, which has received registration from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for disease protection on soybean.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic and genetic profiles of Bacillus cereus strains of food origin in Brazil.
AB  - In Brazil, the incidence of Bacillus cereus outbreaks is unknown, and there is little information about B. cereus occurrence in food. In addition, data on toxin production and genetic characterization of the B. cereus isolates cannot be found. This pathogen causes two distinct types of toxin-mediated foodborne illnesses known as diarrheal and emetic syndromes. Diarrheal syndrome has been linked to three different enterotoxins: two protein complexes, hemolysin BL (HBL) and nonhemolytic enterotoxin (NHE); and an enterotoxic protein, cytotoxin K (cytK). Emetic syndrome is related to cereulide, a toxin encoded by the ces gene. In this study, NHE and HBL production capacities of 155 strains of B. cereus isolated from Brazilian food products were evaluated with an immunoassay. Strains were also tested for the presence of the genes of the HBL and NHE complexes, cytK, cytK-1, cytK-2, and ces, using PCR. HBL was detected in 105 (67.7%) strains and NHE in 154 (99.4%) strains. All the strains harbored at least one gene of the NHE complex, while 96.1% of them were positive for at least one of those of the HBL complex. Genes cytK1 and ces were not detected. All strains showed toxigenic capacity and could represent a risk for consumers if good practices are not followed. This is the first report on toxigenic and genetic profiles of B. cereus strains isolated in Brazil.
TI  - Interactions of Bacillus spp. and plants--with special reference to induced systemic resistance (ISR).
AB  - Biological control of soil-borne pathogens comprises the decrease of inoculum or  of the disease producing activity of a pathogen through one or more mechanisms. Interest in biological control of soil-borne plant pathogens has increased considerably in the last few decades, because it may provide control of diseases that cannot or only partly be managed by other control strategies. Recent advances in microbial and molecular techniques have significantly contributed to new insights in underlying mechanisms by which introduced bacteria function. Colonization of plant roots is an essential step for both soil-borne pathogenic and beneficial rhizobacteria. Colonization patterns showed that rhizobacteria act as biocontrol agents or as growth-promoting bacteria form microcolonies or biofilms at preferred sites of root exudation. Such microcolonies are sites for bacteria to communicate with each other (quorum sensing) and to act in a coordinated manner. Elicitation of induced systemic resistance (ISR) by plant-associated bacteria was initially demonstrated using Pseudomonas spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria. Several strains of the species Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, B. pasteurii, B. cereus, B. pumilus, B. mycoides, and B. sphaericus elicit significant reductions in the incidence or severity of various diseases on a diversity of hosts. Elicitation of ISR by these strains has been demonstrated in greenhouse or field trials on tomato, bell pepper, muskmelon, watermelon, sugar beet, tobacco, Arabidopsis sp., cucumber, loblolly pine, and two tropical crops (long cayenne pepper and green kuang futsoi). Protection resulting from ISR elicited by Bacillus spp. has been reported against leaf-spotting fungal and bacterial pathogens, systemic viruses, a crown-rotting fungal pathogen, root-knot nematodes, and a stem-blight fungal pathogen as well as damping-off, blue mold, and late blight diseases. This progress will lead to a more efficient use of these strains which is worthwhile approach to explore in context of biocontrol strategies.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 in fermented crop straw. METHODS: Total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. All these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of SFC-2. RESULTS: (1) Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16S rDNA gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacterfreundii, Klebsiella terrigena and Citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) Indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of SFC-2 cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that: SFC-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from SFC-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) Antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from the culture of SFC-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease K.
TI  - Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos in soil by enriched cultures.
AB  - Three aerobic bacterial consortia, AC, BC, and DC, developed from pesticide-contaminated soils of Punjab were able to degrade chlorpyrifos after 21 days of incubation in basal medium by 54, 46, and 61% and chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in soil after 30 days by 50, 56, and 64%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella sp., and Serratia marscecens obtained from these consortia showed 84, 84, 81, and 80% degradation of chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in liquid medium after 20 days and 92, 60, 56, and 37% degradation of chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in soil after 30 days. Populations of Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella sp., and Serratia marscecens remained steady in soil experiments except for P. aeruginosa, where the population showed a substantial increase. Formation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, the major metabolite of chlorpyrifos degradation, was observed during the degradation of chlorpyrifos by P. aeruginosa, which disappeared to negligible amounts.
TI  - Investigating the effect of patulin, penicillic acid and EDTA on biofilm formation of isolates from dental unit water lines.
AB  - This study investigated the effect of patulin and penicillic acid, two known quorum-sensing inhibitors, and the common biocide ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the biofilm formation and auto-inducer (AI)-2 production of three isolates from dental unit water lines, Klebsiella sp., Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Penicillic acid on its own had no effect on the biofilm formation of all isolates, whereas in combination with EDTA, it enhanced biofilm formation significantly in Klebsiella sp. and B. cereus. EDTA at concentrations greater than 10 microM promoted biofilm formation in B. cereus and B. subtilis. Patulin was found to promote biofilm formation in B. cereus up to 25 microM. A significant increase in biofilm formation was observed in B. cereus and B. subtilis at concentrations greater than 10 microM of patulin when combined with EDTA. The Vibrio harveyi BB170 AI-2 bioassay showed a positive response for Klebsiella sp. AI-2 production with a maximum fold induction at the late exponential growth phase. Addition of glucose prolonged the AI-2 production phase considerably. No significant effect of patulin, penicillic acid alone as well as in combination with EDTA was observed on AI-2 production by Klebsiella sp. The findings have important implications for the design of biofilm prevention and eradication strategies.
TI  - [Analysis of microbial community of a Beijing simulator water distribution system].
AB  - Identification of compositions of the biofilm in a Beijing simulator water distribution system pipe networks by PCR and single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique and analysis of its heterotrophic bacterial by heterotrophic plate count (HPC) were performed. Results showed that when the water velocities were same, the count of heterotrophic bacterial on the zinficated steel wall was about five times of the PVC. On the other hand, when the pipe materials were zinficated steel, the count of heterotrophic bacterial in the deadwater pipe wall was about 1/5 of the 0.6 m/s region. The difference of the bacterial count maybe related to the smooth of the water pipe surface and the velocity of flow which affected the attachment of the microorganisms and the quantity of O2 and nourishment, respectively. Same SSCP electrophoresis profiles were observed between samples from different material pipes and water velocities. After sequencing and contrasting with the GenBank, the identity of three bands from the SSCP gel with Bacillus cereus (GenBank AB190077), Peudomonas sp. yged143 (GenBank EF419342) and a unclassified bacteria, Bacterium UASWS0134 (GenBank DQ190347) were 100%, 99% and 94%, respectively. The sameness of the microbial community structure may be induced by the samples which were from the same simulator system and the sampling regions were near and the microorganisms could transform in these regions easily. The observed potential pathogens of Bacillus cereus and Peudomonas sp. should lead to a consideration of the microbiology safety of drinking water.
TI  - Ecological consequences of ingestion of Bacillus cereus on Bacillus thuringiensis infections and on the gut flora of a lepidopteran host.
AB  - The Bacillus cereus group comprises a diverse array of non-pathogenic bacteria as well as pathogens such as Bacillus thuringiensis. Their spores are found together in soil and leaves and are therefore likely to commonly interact within hosts. Mixed infections of pathogenic B. thuringiensis and non-pathogenic strains have been little studied, despite their potential impact on biological control and the evolutionary ecology of virulence. Antibiotic secreting strains of B. cereus have been shown to be able to synergize B. thuringiensis (Bt) infections. We explored the ecology of these mixed infections more broadly in the diamondback moth (DBM). We tested whether antibiotic-expressing B. cereus can synergize Bt infections initiated with spores, investigated whether ingestion of antibiotic-expressing B. cereus had any consequences for the larval gut flora and whether synergistic interactions with B. cereus increase Bt reproduction. Ingestion of high-antibiotic secreting B. cereus synergized infections of B. thuringiensis in diamondback moth larvae, but at a lower level than previously reported. Coinfection also increased slightly the number of Bt spores found in cadavers. Culture independent analysis of gut homogenates indicated that ingestion of an antibiotic-expressing strain of B. cereus reduced the abundance of the gut flora and led to gut communities being dominated bacteria with DGGE profiles very similar to pure B. cereus cultures. Ingestion of B. cereus, regardless of genotype, reduced densities of an enteric isolate of Enterobacter sp. These findings support the hypothesis that antibiotic secretion in the gut synergizes B. thuringiensis infections by reducing the abundance of the commensal gut flora and facilitating invasion by bacteria in the B. cereus group.
TI  - Response of endophytic bacterial communities in banana tissue culture plantlets to Fusarium wilt pathogen infection.
AB  - Endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without having pathogenic effects,  and various endophytes have been found to functionally benefit plant disease suppressive ability. In this study, the influence of banana plant stress on the endophytic bacterial communities, which was achieved by infection with the wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, was examined by cultivation-independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA directly amplified from plant tissue DNA. Community analysis clearly demonstrated increased bacterial diversity in pathogen-infected plantlets compared to that in control plantlets. By sequencing, bands most similar to species of Bacillus and Pseudomonas showed high density in the pathogen-treated pattern. In vitro screening of the isolates for antagonistic activity against Fusarium wilt pathogen acquired three strains of endophytic bacteria which were found to match those species that obviously increased in the pathogen infection process; moreover, the most inhibitive strain could also interiorly colonize plantlets and perform antagonism. The evidence obtained from this work showed that antagonistic endophytic bacteria could be induced by the appearance of a host fungal pathogen and further be an ideal biological control agent to use in banana Fusarium wilt disease protection.
TI  - A small-scale, low-cost isolation system for the incubation and rearing of low bacterial load chicks as a model to study microbial-intestinal interactions.
AB  - A small-scale, economical isolator system was adapted to hatch and raise chicks in a bacteria-free environment as a means to observe bacterial interactions with the intestinal mucosa during early development. The design and construction of flexible plastic isolators for incubation and brooding are described along with methodologies for preparation of eggs for entry into the isolators, incubation and hatching. Two trials were conducted, the first in August 2005 and the second in March 2006. Results from both trials showed no differences in body weights of chicks raised in isolation when compared with those raised conventionally. Growth of bacteria was detected from rectal swabs at day 2 post-hatch, with both trials, showing a light growth of Bacillus sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci and haemolytic streptococcus in trial 1, and a light growth of Bacillus cereus only in trial 2. Although not germfree, the growth of bacteria in chicks raised in isolation was decreased or absent when compared with chicks raised conventionally. Feed was negative for contamination and surface swabs of equipment were also negative until day 3 post-hatch, suggesting possible contamination within the eggs themselves. Despite the presence of bacterial species, the isolator system was successful in producing low bacterial load chicks for comparison studies with conventionally raised chicks.
TI  - Effects of Rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of pulverized petal of Rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. Growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. However, the growth of Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. In liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. But the growth of E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. Hydrolyzable tannins isolated from R. rugosa, rugosin D, and tellimagradin II showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp., but little or no effect against Bif. breve and L. salivarius. R. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. Hydrolyzable tannins in R. rugosa, such as rugosin D and tellimagradin II, must be active constituents.
TI  - Biosorption of nickel, chromium and zinc by MerP-expressing recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli hosts able to over-express metal-binding proteins (MerP) originating from Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus RC607) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas sp. K-62) bacterial strains were used to adsorb Ni(2+), Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) in aqueous solutions. The initial adsorption rate and adsorption capacity were determined to evaluate the performance of the biosorbents. With the expression of MerP protein, the metal adsorption capacity of the recombinant strains for Ni(2+), Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) significantly improved. The cells carrying Gram-positive merP gene (GB) adsorbed Zn(2+) and Cr(3+) at a capacity of 22.3 and 0.98 mmol/g biomass, which is 121% and 72% higher, respectively, over that of the MerP-free host cells. Adsorption capacity of the cells carrying Gram-negative merP gene (GP) also increased 144% and 126% for Zn(2+) and Cr(3+), respectively. Both recombinant strains also exhibited 24% and 5% enhancement in adsorption of Ni(2+) for GB and GP, respectively. The initial adsorption rate of the recombinant biosorbents was also higher than that of the MerP-free host, suggesting an increased metal-binding affinity with MerP expression. Severe cell damage on GB biosorbent was observed after Cr(3+) adsorption, probably due to the metal toxicity effect on the cells.
TI  - Two new members of streptothricin class antibiotics from Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov.
AB  - Four streptothricin-group antibiotics (1~4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov. Along with the known antibiotics streptothricins F (1) and D (3), two new members of this class (2, 4) were identified as 12-carbamoyl derivatives of 1 and 3, respectively, mainly by analysis of the IR, HR-MS and NMR spectral data. The antibacterial activities of 1~4 against Escherichia coli (MICs 3.1, 25.0, 3.1 and 12.5 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MICs 6.3, 25.0, 3.1 and 50 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 12.5, >100.0, 6.3, >100.0 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MICs 25.0, 50.0, 25.0 and 50.0 microg/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 50.0, >100.0, 50.0, >100.0 microg/ml) were assayed by micro-broth dilution. The results based on MIC data indicated that 2 and 4 exhibited significantly less potent antibacterial activities when compared to that of 1 and 3.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro Cr(VI) reduction potential in cytosolic extracts of three  indigenous Bacillus sp. isolated from Cr(VI) polluted industrial landfill.
AB  - Three efficient Cr(VI) reducing bacterial strains were isolated from Cr(VI) polluted landfill and characterized for in vitro Cr(VI) reduction. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the newly isolated strains G1DM20, G1DM22 and G1DM64 were closely related to Bacillus cereus, Bacillus fusiformis and Bacillus sphaericus, respectively. The suspended cultures of all Bacillus sp. exhibited more than 85% reduction of 1000 microM Cr(VI) within 30 h. The suspended culture of Bacillus sp. G1DM22 exhibited an ability for continuous reduction of 100 microM Cr(VI) up to seven consecutive inputs. Assays with the permeabilized cells and cell-free extracts from each of Bacillus sp. demonstrated that the hexavalent chromate reductase activity was mainly associated with the soluble fraction of cells and expressed constitutively. The Cr(VI) reduction by the cell-free extracts of Bacillus sp. G1DM20 and G1DM22 was maximum at 30 degrees C and pH 7 whereas, Bacillus sp. G1DM64 exhibited maximum Cr(VI) reduction at pH 6. Addition of 1mM NADH enhanced the Cr(VI) reductase activity in the cell-free extracts of all three isolates. Amongst all three isolates tested, crude cell-free extracts of Bacillus sp. G1DM22 exhibited the fastest Cr(VI) reduction rate with complete reduction of 100 microM Cr(VI) within 100 min. The apparent K(m) and V(max) of the chromate reductase activity in Bacillus sp. G1DM22 were determined to be 200 microM Cr(VI) and 5.5 micromol/min/mg protein, respectively. The Cr(VI) reductase activity in cell-free extracts of all the isolates was stable in presence of different metal ions tested except Hg(2+) and Ag(+).
TI  - Biodegradability of commercial and weathered diesel oils.
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the capability of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the groundwater at a petrol station. Two microbiological methods were used for the biodegradability assessment: the technique based on the redox indicator 2,6 -dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) and soil respirometric experiments using biometer flasks. In the former we tested the bacterial cultures Staphylococcus hominis, Kocuria palustris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI, Ochrobactrum anthropi and Bacillus cereus, a commercial inoculum, consortia obtained from soil and groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons and a consortium from an uncontaminated area. In the respirometric experiments it was evaluated the capability of the native microorganisms present in the soil from a petrol station to biodegrade the diesel oils. The redox indicator experiments showed that only the consortia, even that from an uncontaminated area, were able to biodegrade the weathered diesel. In 48 days, the removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the respirometric experiments was approximately 2.5 times greater when the commercial diesel oil was used. This difference was caused by the consumption of labile hydrocarbons, present in greater quantities in the commercial diesel oil, as demonstrated by gas chromatographic analyses. Thus, results indicate that biodegradability studies that do not consider the weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection of consortia, because even cultures with recognised capability of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.
TI  - Hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate producing abilities of microbes from diverse habitats by dark fermentative process.
AB  - Thirty five bacterial isolates from diverse environmental sources such as contaminated food, nitrogen rich soil, activated sludges from pesticide and oil refineries effluent treatment plants were found to belong to Bacillus, Bordetella, Enterobacter, Proteus, and Pseudomonas sp. on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Under dark fermentative conditions, maximum hydrogen (H(2)) yields (mol/mol of glucose added) were recorded to be 0.68 with Enterobacter aerogenes EGU16 followed by 0.63 with Bacillus cereus EGU43 and Bacillus thuringiensis EGU45. H(2) constituted 63-69% of the total biogas evolved. Out of these 35 microbes, 18 isolates had the ability to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which varied up to 500 mg/l of medium, equivalent to a yield of 66.6%. The highest PHB yield was recorded with B. cereus strain EGU3. Nine strains had high hydrolytic activities (zone of hydrolysis): lipase (34-38 mm) -Bacillus sphaericus strains EGU385, EGU399 and EGU542; protease (56-62 mm) -Bacillus sp. strains EGU444, EGU447 and EGU445; amylase (23 mm) -B. thuringiensis EGU378, marine bacterium strain EGU409 and Pseudomonas sp. strain EGU448. These strains with high hydrolytic activities had relatively low H(2) producing abilities in the range of 0.26-0.42 mol/mol of glucose added and only B. thuringiensis strain EGU378 had the ability to produce PHB. This is the first report among the non-photosynthetic microbes, where the same organism(s) -B. cereus strain EGU43 and B. thuringiensis strain EGU45, have been shown to produce H(2) - 0.63 mol/mol of glucose added and PHB - 420-435 mg/l medium.
TI  - Biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial Streptomycetes.
AB  - The strain ANU 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as Streptomyces sp. closely related to Streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16S rRNA analysis. The cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain were recorded. The strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. It had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. A bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PPA) by FT-IR, EI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral studies. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. flourescens, Staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udum and Penicillium citrinum. The antifungal activity of 3-PPA of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro conditions against Fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. The compound 3-PPA is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide) to control wilt caused by F. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.
TI  - Establishment and characterization of dual-species biofilms formed from a 3,5-dinitrobenzoic-degrading strain and bacteria with high biofilm-forming capabilities.
AB  - In this study, the possibility of establishing a dual-species biofilm from a bacterium with a high biofilm-forming capability and a 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (3,5-DNBA)-degrading bacterium, Comamonas testosteroni A3, was investigated. Our results showed that the combinations of strain A3 with each of five strains with a high biofilm-forming capability (Pseudomonas sp. M8, Pseudomonas putida M9, Bacillus cereus M19, Pseudomonas plecoglossicida M21 and Aeromonas hydrophila M22) presented different levels of enhancement regarding biofilm-forming capability. Among these culture combinations, the 24-h dual-species biofilms established by C. testosteroni A3 with P. putida M9 and A. hydrophila M22 showed the strongest resistance to 3,5-DNBA shock loading, as demonstrated by six successive replacements with DMM2 synthetic wastewater. The degradation rates of 3,5-DNBA by these two culture combinations reached 63.3-91.6% and 70.7-89.4%, respectively, within 6 h of every replacement. Using the gfp-tagged strain M22 and confocal laser scanning microscopy, the immobilization of A3 cells in the dual-species biofilm was confirmed. We thus demonstrated that, during wastewater treatment processes, it is possible to immobilize degrader bacteria with bacteria with a high biofilm-forming capability and to enable them to develop into the mixed microbial flora. This may be a simple and economical method that represents a novel strategy for effective bioaugmentation.
TI  - [Effects of rhamnolipid on the biodegradation of n-hexadecane by microorganism and the cell surface hydrophobicity].
AB  - The experiments were made in laboratory to analyze the effects of rhamnolipid on  the biodegradation of n-hexadecane and the cell surface hydrophobicity using the microorganism ( Bacillus cereus DQ01 and Bacillus sp. DQ02). The results show that the optimal concentrations range of rhamnolipid were 0.4 mmol/L and 0.2 mmol/L, respectively, which can obviously enhance BATH(bacterial adherence to hydrocarbon). The degradation of n-hexadecane by Bacillus cereus DQ01 and Bacillus sp. DQ02 were increased 8.1% and 11.6%, respectively, within 48 h in the presence of the rhamnolipid than that of in the absence of the rhamnolipid. The growth of two strains and BATH increased with obviously in the presence of the rhamnolipid. Especially BATH of Bacillus sp. DQ02 was 44% in the presence of rhamnolipid, which was better than BATH of Bacillus cereus DQ01 without rhamnolipid. In contrast, glucose experiments showed that addition of rhamnolipid did not have much impact on growth of both strains and cell surface hydrophobicity. Moreover, the interfacial tension decreased with the addition of rhamnolipid. The rhamnolipid-treated cells had a rougher texture than the untreated cell.
TI  - InhA-like protease secreted by Bacillus sp. S17110 inhabited in turban shell.
AB  - A strain producing a potent protease was isolated from turban shell. The strain was identified as Bacillus sp. S17110 based on phylogenetic analysis. The enzyme was purified from culture supernatant of Bacillus sp. S17110 to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, SP-Sepharose, and DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography. Protease activity of the purified protein against casein was found to be stable at pH 7 to pH 10 and around 50 degrees . Approximately 70% of proteolytic activity of the enzyme was detected either in the presence of 100 mM SDS or Tween 20. The enzyme activity was enhanced in the presence of Ca2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, but was inhibited by EDTA, indicating that it requires metal for its activity. The purified enzyme was found to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 75 kDa, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme was analyzed through peptide fingerprint mass spectra generated from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and a BLAST search, and identified as immune inhibitor A (inhA) deduced from nucleotide sequence of B. cereus G9241. Since InhA was identified as protease that cleave antibacterial proteins found in insect, inhA-like protease purified from Bacillus sp. S17110 might be pathogenic to sea invertebrates.
TI  - Biosorption and bioreduction of Cr(VI) by locally isolated Cr-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Cr(VI) biosorption and bioreduction ability of locally isolated Cr-resistant bacteria was investigated using the shake-flask technique. A mixture of S. epidermidis and B. cereus showed the highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) level at 750 mg/L Cr(VI) followed by S. aureus and Bacillus sp. of 250 mg/L, and A. haemolyticus of 70 mg/L. From the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, the treatment of cells with heat-acid resulted in the highest amount of Cr(VI) adsorped (78.25 mg/g dry wt. for S. epidermidis) compared to heat-acetone (67.93 mg/g dry wt. Bacillus sp.), heat only (36.05 mg/g dry wt. S. epidermidis) or untreated cells (45.40 mg/g dry wt. S. epidermidis and B. cereus). FTIR analysis showed the involvement of amine groups in Cr(VI) adsorption. In the bioreduction study, A. haemolyticus was able to completely reduce Cr(VI) up to 50 mg/L.
TI  - Efficacy of enterocin AS-48 against bacilli in ready-to-eat vegetable soups and purees.
AB  - The broad-spectrum bacteriocin enterocin AS-48 was tested for biopreservation of  ready-to-eat vegetable foods (soups and purees) against aerobic mesophilic endospore-forming bacteria. By adding AS-48 (10 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus LWL1 was completely inhibited in all six vegetable products tested (natural vegetable cream, asparagus cream, traditional soup, homemade-style traditional soup, vegetable soup, and vichyssoise) for up to 30 days at 6, 15, and 22 degrees C. A collection of strains isolated from spoiled purees showed slightly higher resistance to AS-48 in the order Paenibacillus sp. > Bacillus macroides > B. cereus, although they were also completely inhibited in natural vegetable cream by AS-48 at 10 microg/ml. However, cocktails of five or eight strains composed of B. cereus (three strains), B. macroides (two strains), and Paenibacillus sp., Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Paenibacillus amylolyticus showed higher bacteriocin resistance with AS-48 of up to 50 microg/ml required for complete inactivation in natural vegetable cream stored at 22 degrees C. Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR) analysis showed that paenibacilli (along with some B. cereus) was the predominant survivor in the cocktails after bacteriocin treatment. To increase the effectiveness of enterocin AS-48, the bacteriocin was tested (at 20 microg/ml) against the eight-strain cocktail in natural vegetable cream in combination with other antimicrobials. The combination of AS-48 and nisin had a slight but significant additive effect. Bactericidal activity was greatly enhanced by phenolic compounds (carvacrol, eugenol, geraniol, and hydrocinnamic acid), achieving a rapid and complete inactivation of bacilli in the tested puree at 22 degrees C.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a bacteriocin-like substance produced by Bacillus sp. P34 that targets the bacterial cell envelope.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the mode of action of BLS P34, a bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) produced by a novel Bacillus sp. strain P34 isolated from the Amazon basin. The effect of the BLS was tested against Listeria monocytogenes, showing a bactericidal effect at 200 AU (activity units) ml(-1), while no inhibition of spore outgrowth of Bacillus cereus was observed with a dose of 1,600 AU ml(-1). Growth of Escherichia coli and Salmonella Enteritidis was inhibited, but only when the chelating agent EDTA was co-added with the BLS. The effect of BLS P34 on L. monocytogenes was also investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Treated cells showed an important frequency increase in 1,452 and 1,397 cm(-1) and decrease in 1,217 and 1,058 cm(-1), corresponding assignments of fatty acids and phospholipids. Transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell envelope and loss of protoplasmic material. BLS P34 was bactericidal to Gram-positive, and also showed inhibitory effect against Gram-negative bacteria. There is evidence that its mode of action corresponds to that of a membrane-active substance. The knowledge about the mode of action of this BLS is essential to determine its effective application as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial compound produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced higher antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and could be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent were located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Anaerobic biodegradation of fluoranthene under methanogenic conditions in presence of surface-active compounds.
AB  - Bacillus cereus isolated from municipal wastewater treatment plant was used as a  model strain to assess the efficiency of two anionic surfactants, a chemical surfactant and a biosurfactant during fluoranthene biodegradation under anaerobic methanogenic conditions. The surfactants selected for the study were linear alkyl benzene sulphonates (LAS) and rhamnolipid-biosurfactant complex from Pseudomonas sp. PS-17. Biodegradation of fluoranthene was monitored by GC/MS for a period up to 12th day. No change in the fluoranthene concentration was registered after 7th day. The presence of LAS enhanced the cell growth as well as the fluoranthene biodegradation. The rhamnolipid-biosurfactant at both used concentrations inhibited the cell growth and had no effect on the biodegradation rate. It was shown that LAS did not affect the microbial cell permeability and its positive effect on fluoranthene biodegradation was most likely as a result of the increased fluoranthene solubility. The results indicate that LAS can be considered as a promising agent for facilitation of the process of anaerobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) biodegradation under methanogenic conditions.
TI  - Bacillus acidiceler sp. nov., isolated from a forensic specimen, containing Bacillus anthracis pX02 genes.
AB  - Research at the Center for Biological Defense identified plasmid-borne forms of Bacillus anthracis pXO2 genes in a Gram-positive, endospore-forming rod, isolated from a forensic specimen considered a credible threat of harbouring anthrax. Conventional, commercial and molecular-based methods indicated that the isolate (CBD 119(T)) was not B. anthracis and considered not to be a member of the Bacillus cereus group. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, strain CBD 119(T) was most closely related to Bacillus luciferensis LMG 18422(T) (99.3 %). Phenotyping and fatty acid methyl ester analysis of the isolate were conducted alongside B. luciferensis JCM 12212(T). The major cellular fatty acids (anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0), and >7 iso or anteiso forms) supported inclusion of the isolate in the genus Bacillus. Strain CBD 119(T) was inconsistent with B. luciferensis JCM 12212(T) for 18 of 96 traits evaluated including motility, degree of endospore-driven swelling and pH optimum; the two were linked by fatty acid methyl ester analysis as separate but closely related species. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain CBD 119(T) and B. luciferensis JCM 12212(T) resulted in less than 20 % hybridization. The results of biochemical and physiological characterization, chemotaxonomic analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization differentiated strain CBD 119(T) both phenotypically and genotypically from the only species with validly published name with greater than 97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The isolate has an accelerated doubling time when grown in aerated broth at pH 5.9 relative to that at pH 7.1. Therefore, it is proposed that strain CBD 119(T) represents a novel species, Bacillus acidiceler sp. nov. The type strain is strain CBD 119(T) (=NRRL B-41736(T)=DSM 18954(T)).
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Site-specific and asymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral 2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol diacetate by a bacterial esterase from an isolated strain.
AB  - Bacillus cereus 809A and Burkholderia sp. 711C were isolated from soil. These strains demonstrate hydrolysis activity towards prochiral 2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol diacetate and accumulated the corresponding chiral monoacetates into the reaction mixture. When 2-phenyl 1,3-propanediol diacetate was used as a substrate, the produced monoacetates with Burkholderia sp. 711C were obtained in a racemic form but that produced by Bacillus cereus 809A showed an excess of the (S)-form. The resting cell reaction revealed that for Bacillus cereus 809A, there was an enrichment of one of the enantiomers of the monoacetate such that the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of the (S)-form was over 95%. The purified enzyme from Bacillus cereus 809A hydrolyzed diacetate to monoacetate, and the e.e. value of the (S)-form increased by prolonged reaction in a way similar to the resting cell reaction. From N-terminal amino acids, this esterase is conserved in some strains of Bacillus for which the genomic sequences have been reported.
TI  - Characterization of acetanilide herbicides degrading bacteria isolated from tea garden soil.
AB  - Three different green manures were added to the tea garden soils separately and incubated for 40 days. After, incubation, acetanilide herbicides alachlor and metolachlor were spiked into the soils, separately, followed by the isolation of bacteria in each soil at designed intervals. Several bacterial strains were isolated from the soils and identified as Bacillus silvestris, B. niacini, B. pseudomycoides, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. simplex, B. megaterium, and two other Bacillus sp. (Met1 and Met2). Three unique strains with different morphologies were chosen for further investigation. They were B. megaterium, B. niacini, and B. silvestris. The isolated herbicide-degrading bacteria showed optimal performance among three incubation temperatures of 30 degrees C and the best activity in the 10 to 50 microg/ml concentration of the herbicide. Each bacterial strain was able to degrade more than one kind of test herbicides. After incubation for 119 days, B. cereus showed the highest activity to degrade alachlor and propachlor, and B. thuringiensis to degrade metolachlor.
TI  - Walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  - Different cultivars of walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves (Cv. Lara, Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise and Parisienne) grown in Portugal, were investigated in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. The antimicrobial capacity was screened against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria, being B. cereus the most susceptible one (MIC 0.1mg/mL). Gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/mL. Lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus sp. Antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. In a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (EC(50) values lower than 1mg/mL), being Cv. Lara the most effective one.
TI  - Bacterial, fungal and yeast contamination in six brands of irreversible hydrocolloid impression materials.
AB  - This study assessed the level of contamination of six commercially available irreversible hydrocolloids (two containing chlorhexidine) and identified the contamination present in the materials. Petri dishes containing selective and enriched culture media were inoculated with alginate powder (0.06 g), in triplicate. After incubation (37 degrees C/7 days), the colony-forming units (CFU) were counted and Gram stained. Biochemical identification of the different morphotypes was also performed. The contamination levels for the materials were: Jeltrate--389 CFU/g; Jeltrate Plus--516 CFU/g; Jeltrate Chromatic--135 CFU/g; Hydrogum--1,455 CFU/g; Kromopan--840 CFU/g; and Greengel--59 CFU/g. Gram staining revealed the presence of Gram-positive bacillus and Gram-positive cocci. The bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus sp., Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, and Nocardia sp.; the filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizopus sp., Neurospora sp.; and the yeast Candida sp. were isolated. The contamination detected in the impression materials points out the need for adopting measures to improve the microbiological quality of these materials. The use of contaminated materials in the oral cavity goes against the basic principles for controlling cross-contamination and may represent a risk for debilitated or immunocompromised patients.
TI  - The identification of antibacterial compounds for the development of enhanced media for the detection of foodborne fungi.
AB  - In an effort to identify a more suitable antibiotic for utilization in mycological media, 12 food borne fungal species from various genera including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Eurotium chevalieri, Fusarium moniliforme, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis, Geotrichum candidum, Rhodotorula glutinis and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans along with 21 chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial isolates from fresh produce and ATCC cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, E. coli, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus spp. were tested for their abilities to grow on dichloran rose bengal agar containing various levels of gentamicin, chlortetracycline or chloramphenicol. Results indicated that all fungal isolates except for Rh. glutinis and R. stolonifer grew well on all media tested. Rh. glutinis did not grow on media containing gentamicin whereas R. stolonifer produced very restricted or no growth on these media. All bacterial isolates from fresh produce, P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and P. fluorescens (ATCC BAA-477) grew well at 100, 125 and 150 mg chloramphenicol/liter medium, but they did not grow on media containing chlortetracycline (100, 125, or 150 mg/L) or gentamicin (15, 25, or 35 mg/L). P. aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) grew well on media containing chloramphenicol or gentamicin, but not in the presence of chlortetracycline. P. carotovorum, E. coli, B. cereus and Staphylococcus spp. did not grow on any of the selective media tested.
TI  - Microbial consortium bioaugmentation of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contaminated soil.
AB  - In this study we evaluated the capacity of a defined microbial consortium (five bacteria: Mycobacterium fortuitum, Bacillus cereus, Microbacterium sp., Gordonia polyisoprenivorans, Microbacteriaceae bacterium, Naphthalene-utilizing bacterium; and a fungus identified as Fusarium oxysporum) isolated from a PAHs contaminated landfarm site to degrade and mineralize different concentrations (0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg kg(-1)) of anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene in soil. PAHs degradation and mineralization was evaluated by gas chromatography and respirometry, respectively. The microbial consortium degraded on average, 99%, 99% and 96% of the different concentrations of anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene in the soil, in 70 days, respectively. This consortium mineralized 78%, on average, of the different concentrations of the 3 PAHs in soil after 70 days. Contrarily, the autochthonous soil microbial population showed no substantial mineralization of the PAHs. Bacterial and fungal isolates from the consortium, when inoculated separately to the soil, were less effective in anthracene mineralization compared to the consortium. This signifies synergistic promotion of PAHs mineralization by mixtures of the monoculture isolates (the microbial consortium).
TI  - Differentiation and characterization by molecular techniques of Bacillus cereus group isolates from poto poto and degue, two traditional cereal-based fermented foods of Burkina Faso and Republic of Congo.
AB  - Poto poto (a maize sourdough) and degue (a pearl millet-based food) are two traditional African fermented foods. The molecular biology of toxigenic and pathogenic bacteria found in those foods is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to study the phylogenetic relatedness and toxigenic potential of 26 Bacillus cereus group isolates from these traditional fermented foods. The relatedness of the isolates was evaluated with repetitive element sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR) and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis. A multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting the lef and capC genes of B. anthracis pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and the sspE chromosomal gene of B. cereus and B. anthracis also was carried out. Melting curve analysis of the sspE amplification product was used to differentiate B. cereus from B. anthracis, and the presence of the B. cereus enterotoxin genes was determined with PCR amplification. Isolates had 15 different REP-PCR profiles, according to which they could be clustered into four groups. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis identified 23 isolates as B. cereus or B. anthracis and three isolates as B. cereus or Bacillus sp. Multiplex real-time PCR amplification indicated the absence of the lef and capC genes of B. anthracis pXO 1 and pXO2 plasmids, and melting curve analysis revealed amplification of the 71-bp sspE product typical of B. cereus in all isolates instead of the 188-bp amplicon of B. anthracis, confirming the identity of these isolates as B. cereus. Four isolates had amylolytic activity. All isolates had lecithinase activity and beta-hemolytic activity. Enterotoxin production was detected in two isolates. The emetic toxin gene was not detected in any isolate. The nheB toxin gene was detected in 19 isolates by PCR amplification; one of these isolates also contained the hblD (L1) gene. The cytotoxin K cytK-1 gene was not detected, but the cytK-2 gene was clearly detected in six isolates.
TI  - Characterization of a broad range antibacterial substance from a new Bacillus species isolated from Amazon basin.
AB  - A Bacillus sp. strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance was characterized by biochemical profiling and 16S rDNA sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that this strain has low sequence similarity with most Bacillus spp., suggesting a new species was isolated. The antimicrobial activity was detected starting at the exponential growth phase, and maximum activity was observed at stationary phase. The substance was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, B. cereus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Erwinia carotovora, Pasteurella haemolytica, Salmonella Gallinarum, among other. The antibacterial substance was stable over a wide pH range, but it was sensitive to pronase E and lipase. The antibacterial substance was bactericidal and bacteriolytic to L. monocytogenes and B. cereus at 160 AU ml(-1). The identification of a broad range bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against L. monocytogenes addresses an important aspect of food protection against pathogens and spoilage microorganisms.
TI  - Large-scale production and efficient recovery of PHB with desirable material properties, from the newly characterised Bacillus cereus SPV.
AB  - A newly characterised Bacillus strain, Bacillus cereus SPV was found to produce PHB at a concentration of 38% of its dry cell weight in shaken flask cultures, using glucose as the main carbon source. Polymer production was then scaled up to 20 L batch fermentations where 29% dry cell weight of PHB was obtained within 48 h. Following this, a simple glucose feeding strategy was developed and the cells accumulated 38% dry cell weight of PHB, an increase in the overall volumetric yield by 31% compared to the batch fermentation. Sporulation is the cause of low PHB productivity from the genus Bacillus [Wu, Q., Huang, H., Hu, G.H., Chen, J., Ho, K.P., Chen, G.Q., 2001. Production of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate by Bacillus sp. JMa5 cultivated in molasses media. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 80, 111-118]. However, in this study, acidic pH conditions (4.5-5.8) completely suppress sporulation, in accordance with Kominek and Halvorson [Kominek, L.A., Halvorson, H.O., 1965. Metabolism of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoin in Bacillus cereus. J. Bacteriol. 90, 1251-1259], and result in an increase in the yield of PHB production. This observation emphasises the potential of the use of Bacillus in the commercial production of PHB and other PHAs. The recovery of the PHB produced was optimised and the isolated polymer characterised to identify its material properties. The polymer extracted, was found to have similar molecular weight, polydispersity index and lower crystallinity index than others reported in literature. Also, the extracted polymer was found to have desirable material properties for potential tissue engineering applications.
TI  - Biomedical evaluation of black lemurs (Eulemur macaco macaco) in Lokobe Reserve,  Madagascar.
AB  - Complete medical evaluations were performed on 25 wild black lemurs (Eulemur macaco macaco) in Lokobe Reserve, northwestern Madagascar. Each animal received a complete physical examination. Weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded. Blood samples were collected for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count, hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin analysis, trace mineral analysis, and Toxoplasma gondii and viral serology. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite examination. Ectoparasites were collected and identified. Values were compared to established ranges from captive black lemurs in North American zoos. Significant differences exist between captive and wild animals for total white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, band neutrophil count, eosinophil count, monocyte count, and basophil count, and for serum biochemistry values of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase, total protein, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, potassium, and creatine phosphokinase. One animal had a positive Toxoplasma titer. Detected endoparasites were identified as Lemuricola and Callistroura. Two ectoparasite mites were identified, one within the Psoroptes genus and one within the Laelapidae family. Enteric bacterial flora included Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Klebsiella ozaenae and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Detection of enterotoxic Bacillus cereus producing hemolytic and non hemolytic enterotoxins by PCR test.
AB  - Nine strains belonging to Bacillus cereus group has been isolated from food and environmental samples. Their taxonomic position was confirmed by RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA gene digested with TaqI. The detection of DNA sequences encoding the hemolysin BL complex and enterotoxin NHE, was studied in Bacillus sp. isolates. Set of primers was used to amplify fragment of hblD gene by PCR. For the detection of nheB gene a new primer set was developed which allowed to amplify 273 bp fragment from wide number of strains belonging to B. cereus group. The hblD gene was present in 7 out of 9 isolates whereas nheB gene occurred in all of them. Reference strains of B. cereus LOCK 0807, and B. thuringiensis NCAIM 01262 contained both genes. Strains of B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and B. pumilus LOCK 0814 do not contain both genes. Obtained results showed that B. thuringiensis NCAIM 01262 contains both genes and therefore may be harmful for human beings.
TI  - Properties of bacterial corrosion of stainless steel and its inhibition by protamine coating.
AB  - We investigated characteristics of the corrosion of stainless steel specimens by  bacteria and the effects of using antimicrobial coating on the surface for inhibiting corrosion. Bacillus sp. 2-A and Staphylococcus sp. 2-1 cells adhered tightly to a stainless steel SUS304 specimen, formed a microcolony or biofilm, and had highly corrosive activities. Microbially influenced corrosion (MC) was observed under or around adhering cells. However, dead cells were markedly less active than viable cells not only in corroding the specimen but also in adhering to its surface. The culture supernatant was not able to induce the corrosion of SUS304 effectively. A protamine coating on the specimen killed bacterial cells only on its surface, interfered with cell adhesion, and inhibited MC. From these results, adhesion of viable cells to the surface of a SUS304 specimen led to the outbreak of MC. Protamine was also found to be an effective substance tested for protecting the specimen from both cell adhesion and surface MC. We suggest that a protamine coating can be applied as a convenient and inexpensive corrosion prevention method.
TI  - A detailed analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene segments for the diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes contain nine "hypervariable regions" (V1-V9) that demonstrate considerable sequence diversity among different bacteria. Species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1-V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1-V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterium species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the "MEGALIGN" files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.
TI  - Chromosomal-gene-mediated inhibition of intestinal and foodborne pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced a more antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-Butanol. 12 % SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Microbial load and antimicrobial property of two Nigerian herbal remedies.
AB  - The use of herbal remedies had increased significantly in the last one decade in  Nigeria. This has led to the production of herbal products with bogus claims. The microbial quality and antibacterial properties of two Nigerian herbal remedies with such claimed efficacy of curing all manners of microbial diseases were assessed. The herbal remedies were discovered to be contaminated with the following microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus cereus, Basidiobotrytis sp, Oedocephalum sp, Varicosporium sp and Articulospora inflata. Antibacterial analysis using the killing rate revealed that the herbal remedies had bacteriostatic and not bacteriocidal effect. Qualitative phytochemical screening of the herbal remedies revealed the presence of saponin, tannins, alkaloids, anthraquinone and cardiac glycosides which suggest possible antimicrobial effect. However, the presence of microbial contaminants in the herbal remedies suggests that they may serve as source of infection to end users.
TI  - Insight in to the phylogeny of polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis: horizontal gene transfer.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are gaining more and more importance the world over  due to their structural diversity and close analogy to plastics. Their biodegradability makes them extremely desirable substitutes for synthetic plastics. PHAs are produced in organisms under certain stress conditions. Here, we investigated 253 sequenced (completely and unfinished) genomes for the diversity and phylogenetics of the PHA biosynthesis. Discrepancies in the phylogenetic trees for phaA, phaB and phaC genes of the PHA biosynthesis have led to the suggestion that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may be a major contributor for its evolution. Twenty four organisms belonging to diverse taxa were found to be involved in HGT. Among these, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 seem to have acquired all the three genes through HGT events and have not been characterized so far as PHA producers. This study also revealed certain potential organisms such as Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Brucella suis 1330, Burkholderia sp., DSMZ 9242 and Leptospira interrogans serovar lai str. 56601, which can be transformed into novel PHA producers through recombinant DNA technology.
TI  - Involvement of cytoplasmic membrane damage in the copper (II)-dependent cytotoxicity of a novel naturally occurring tripyrrole.
AB  - In the presence of a nonlethal concentration of Cu(II), washed Escherichia coli ATCC8739 cells were killed by a novel tripyrrole 1, isolated as a red pigment from the Serratia sp. Cell killing was accompanied by a depletion in the potassium pools of the cells due to the damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, without any detectable DNA damage as revealed by the transformed plasmid DNA and phage induction assay. This revealed that the bactericidal activity of compound 1 in the presence of Cu(II) results from membrane damage. Induction of endogenous catalase in the E. coli cells increased their resistance against the combination of compound 1 and Cu(II). Although compound 1 alone generated large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it did not show any cell killing against E. coli in the absence of Cu(II). The Cu(II)-dependent bactericidal activity of compound 1 was suppressed by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, bathocuproine, catalase and superoxide disumutase (SOD), but not by dimethyl sulfoxide. These findings suggest that recycling redox reactions between Cu(II) and Cu(I), involving compound 1 and hydrogen peroxide on the cell surface, must be important in the mechanism of the killing. Compound 1 alone showed selective bactericidal activity against the gram positive bacterium, Bacillus cereus ATCC 6630, possibly due to its differential cellular transport.
TI  - Differential identification of Bacillus anthracis from environmental Bacillus species using microarray analysis.
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether microarray analysis could be employed for the differential identification of a range of environmental Bacillus sp. from four strains of Bacillus anthracis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oligonucleotide probes were designed that were specific to virulence factor genes of B. anthracis (pag, lef and cap), the variable number tandem repeat region of the B. anthracis vrrA gene and to the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer region (ITS) and pleiotropic regulator (plcR) regions of the Bacillus cereus subgroup species. Generic probes were also designed to hybridize with conserved regions of the 16S rRNA genes of Bacillus (as a positive control), Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas sp., Streptococcus sp., Mycobacterium sp. and to all members of the Enterobacteriaceae to allow simultaneous detection of these bacteria. Identification of B. anthracis was found to rely entirely on hybridization of DNA specific to regions of the pag, lef and cap genes. Cross-reaction was observed between B. anthracis and other Bacillus species with all the other Bacillus probes tested. Results obtained using microarray hybridizations were confirmed using conventional microbiological techniques and found to have very high comparability. CONCLUSIONS: Microarray-based assays are an effective method for the identification of B. anthracis from mixed-culture environmental samples without problems of false-positivity that have been observed with conventional PCR assays. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Identification of environmental Bacillus sp. by conventional PCR is prone to potential for reporting false-positives. This study provides a method for the exclusion of such isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sp.: structure-activity relationship.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sativa, M. arborea and M. arabica against a selection of medically important yeasts, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was investigated. Structure-activity growth inhibitory effects of related prosapogenins and sapogenins are also described. Increasing antibiotic activity was observed going from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples, suggesting that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy. Activity was especially high against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) with M. arabica being the species showing a broader spectrum of action. Discrete antifungal activity was also observed, mainly against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The observed antimicrobial properties of M. sativa and M. arborea were related to the content of medicagenic acid, while hederagenin seems to contribute to the bioactivity of M. arabica total sapogenins.
TI  - Use of single-point genome signature tags as a universal tagging method for microbial genome surveys.
AB  - We developed single-point genome signature tags (SP-GSTs), a generally applicable, high-throughput sequencing-based method that targets specific genes to generate identifier tags from well-defined points in a genome. The technique yields identifier tags that can distinguish between closely related bacterial strains and allow for the identification of microbial community members. SP-GSTs are determined by three parameters: (i) the primer designed to recognize a conserved gene sequence, (ii) the anchoring enzyme recognition sequence, and (iii) the type IIS restriction enzyme which defines the tag length. We evaluated the SP-GST method in silico for bacterial identification using the genes rpoC, uvrB, and recA and the 16S rRNA gene. The best distinguishing tags were obtained with the restriction enzyme Csp6I upstream of the 16S rRNA gene, which discriminated all organisms in our data set to at least the genus level and most organisms to the species level. The method was successfully used to generate Csp6I-based tags upstream of the 16S rRNA gene and allowed us to discriminate between closely related strains of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. This concept was further used successfully to identify the individual members of a defined microbial community.
TI  - Identification of nif genes in N2-fixing bacterial strains isolated from rice fields along the Yangtze River Plain.
AB  - The aim of this research was to identify nifH and nifHDKYE ' genes in twenty strains of N2-fixing heterotrophic bacteria isolated from rice fields in the Yangtze River Plain. Southern hybridization of the total DNA from each strain was performed with the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifHDKYE ' gene probe (6.2 kb Eco RI fragment from pSA30) and the Azospirillum brasilense nifH gene probe (0.6 kb Eco RI-Hin dIII fragment from pHU8). We found that Eco RI fragments of total DNA from Aeromonas hydrophila HY2, Bacillus azotoformans FD, Bacillus licheniformis NCH1, NCH5, WH4, Bacillus brevis NC2, Bacillus pumilus NC12, Bacillus cereus NCH2, Citrobacter freundii HY5, HY9, Derxia gummosa HZ5, Pseudomonas mendocina HZ1 and Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes WH3 were positively hybridized with both of the probes. Agrobacterium radiobacter HY17, Corynebacterium sp. HY12, YZ and Pseudomonas sp. HY11 had Eco RI fragments hybridized with the K. pneumoniae nifHDKYE ' gene probe. An Eco RI fragment of total DNA from Bacillus megaterium YY4 was positively hybridized to the A. brasilense nifH gene probe. No hybridization sign was found in the total DNA fragments from Alcaligenes cupidus YY6 and Corynebacterium sp. NC11 hybridized with either of the gene probes. The data provide the number and size of EcoRI fragments of the total DNA hybridized with the nif gene probes for these strains of rarely studied species, suggesting additional evidence for N2 fixing and nif gene diversity of N2-fixing bacteria in rice fields along the Yangtze River Plain.
TI  - Attachment of different soil bacteria to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal extraradical hyphae is determined by hyphal vitality and fungal species.
AB  - Attachment of certain bacteria to living arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal extraradical hyphae may be an important prerequisite for interactions between these microorganisms, with implications for nutrient supply and plant health. The attachment of five different strains of gfp-tagged soil bacteria (Paenibacillus brasilensis PB177 (pnf8), Bacillus cereus VA1 (pnf8), Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 :: gfp/lux, Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6G, and Paenibacillus peoriae BD62 (pnf8)) to vital and nonvital extraradical hyphae of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus sp. MUCL 43205 and Glomus intraradices MUCL 43194 was examined. Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus did not attach to hyphae, whereas the other bacterial strains did to a varying degree. Only P. brasilensis showed greater attachment to vital hyphae than nonvital hyphae of both Glomus species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens showed a higher attachment to vital compared with nonvital Glomus sp. MUCL 43205 hyphae, whereas this relationship was opposite for attachment to G. intraradices. Both B. cereus and P. peoriae showed higher attachment to nonvital hyphae. This study provides novel evidence that under laboratory conditions soil bacteria differ in their ability to colonize vital and nonvital hyphae and that this can also be influenced by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species involved. The significance of bacterial attachment to mycorrhizal fungal extraradical hyphae is discussed.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from the different developmental stages and larval organs of the obligate parasitic fly, Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae).
AB  - Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is the major myiasis-causing fly species in the whole of Eurasia for most important domestic animals. The aim of the present work was to obtain data on the culturable bacteria isolated under aerobic conditions from this fly: bacteria were isolated from all developmental stages (larvae, pupa, and imago) of Wohlfahrtia magnifica, and the third-stage larval organs were also sampled. To determine the possible antagonistic effects between the dominant bacterial groups, an antibiosis assay was carried out. Plating and isolation of bacteria was performed by classical microbiological methods. Characterization of the isolated strains was carried out via a polyphasic approach; classical phenotypic tests, chemotaxonomical examinations, and 16S rDNA sequence analyses were also applied. In the case of maggot macerate samples, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were characteristic. Members of a new genus (Schineria) belonging to the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria were also isolated. According to our data, the shifts in the Schineria and Proteus populations within the larvae are strongly influenced by their interactions with each other and among the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The pupa and imago samples contained several other Gram-negative bacteria (Stenotrophomonas, Brevundimonas, etc.). Among Gram-positive bacteria, in all maggot macerate samples, members of the genus Bacillus and the Arthrobacter-Micrococcus group of actinobacteria were dominant (neither of them was a producer or sensitive to the compounds of other microorganisms), and bacteria related to the genus Corynebacterium were also found. From the larvae Aureobacterium liquefaciens and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated, and from the pupae Dietzia maris and Enterococcus faecalis. In the samples of third-stage larval organs, the dominant groups were the same as in the third-stage larval macerate sample; however, several additional genera/species were observed (Rhodococcus fascians, Streptomyces sp., Rathayibacter sp., Bacillus thuringiensis/cereus).
TI  - Characterization of contamination in and toxicities of a shipyard area in Hong Kong.
AB  - This is the first integrated study on the contaminant characterization and toxicities of a shipyard area. This site in Hong Kong contained 3.6-33.4 mg kg(-1) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and 5-79 g kg(-1) oil and grease. Other pollutants exceeding the Dutch intervention values were total polyaromatic hydrocarbons, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals Cu, Pb and Zn. These pollutants persisted partially owing to the poor fertility with <125 mg N kg(-1) and <530 mg P kg(-1) typical of coastal soil. Sediments collected within 100 m also showed contamination exceeding the China and Hong Kong intervention levels. The shipyard soil killed two bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Acinetobacter sp. isolated from a clean coastal soil, inhibited germination of three exogenous plants Triticum aestivum, Brassica chinense and Lolium perenne, and inhibited proliferation of three indigenous bacteria: Methylobacterium sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Thus, ex situ remediation was needed.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Investigations on bacteria as a potential biological control agent of summer chafer, Amphimallon solstitiale L. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).
AB  - Studying the bacteria of hazardous insects allows the opportunity to find potentially better biological control agents. Therefore, in this study, bacteria from summer chafer (Amphimallon solstitiale L., Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) we isolated and identified the insecticidal effects of bacteria isolated from A. solstitiale and Melolontha melolontha L. (common cockchafer, Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and the mixtures of these bacterial isolates were investigated on A. solstitiale larvae. Crystals from Bacillus sp. isolated from M. melolontha were also purified, and tested against the second and third-stage larvae of A. solstitiale. The bacterial isolates of A. solstitiale were identified as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus, based on their morphology, spore formation, nutritional features, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. The insecticidal effects of the bacterial isolates determined on the larvae of A. solstitiale were 90% with B. cereus isolated from A. solstitiale, and 75% with B. cereus, B. sphaericus and B. thuringiensis isolated from M. melolontha within ten days. The highest insecticidal effects of the mixed infections on the larvae of A. solstitiale were 100% both with B. cereus+B. sphaericus and with B. cereus+B. thuringiensis. In the crystal protein bioassays, the highest insecticidal effect was 65% with crystals of B. thuringiensis and B. sphaericus isolated from M. melolontha within seven days. Finally, our results showed that the mixed infections could be utilized as microbial control agents, as they have a 100% insecticidal effect on the larvae of A. solstitiale.
TI  - Mercury tolerance of thermophilic Bacillus sp. and Ureibacillus sp.
AB  - Although resistance of microorganisms to Hg(II) salts has been widely investigated and resistant strains have been reported from many eubacterial genera, there are few reports of mercuric ion resistance in extremophilic microorganisms. Moderately thermophilic mercury resistant bacteria were selected by growth at 62 degrees C on Luria agar containing HgCl(2). Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes of two isolates showed the closest matches to be with Bacillus pallidus and Ureibacillus thermosphaericus. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for HgCl(2) were 80 microg/ml and 30 microg/ml for these isolates, respectively, compared to 10 microg/ml for B. pallidus H12 DSM3670, a mercury-sensitive control. The best-characterised mercury-resistant Bacillus strain, B. cereus RC607, had an MIC of 60 microg/ml. The new isolates had negligible mercuric reductase activity but removed Hg from the medium by the formation of a black precipitate, identified as HgS by X-ray powder diffraction analysis. No volatile H(2)S was detected in the headspace of cultures in the absence or presence of Hg(2+), and it is suggested that a new mechanism of Hg tolerance, based on the production of non-volatile thiol species, may have potential for decontamination of solutions containing Hg(2+) without production of toxic volatile H(2)S.
TI  - Treatment of hypersaline-containing wastewater with salt-tolerant microorganisms.
AB  - Two salt-tolerant bacteria were isolated from soil samples to treat a high-salt-content wastewater from a pickled plum production plant. The strains, which were identified as Staphylococcus sp. and Bacillus cereus, grew well in a medium containing 0 to 15% NaCl. When wastewater in a flask was treated with the strains for 72 h, the COD removal was about 70%, and this was increased to about 90% when they were used in a pilot plant (working volume 1 m3) in a batch culture carried out for 7 d. The Staphylococcus sp. and Bacillus cereus strains occupied almost all of the pilot plant, in which they were present in a ratio of 3:1 (at 23-27 degrees C).
TI  - An active-site mutation causes enhanced reactivity and altered regiospecificity of transglucosylation catalyzed by the Bacillus sp. SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase.
AB  - Bacillus sp. SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase catalyzes the transglucosylation of sucrose to produce three regioisomers of the glucosylsucroses, with theanderose (6-O(G)-glucosylsucrose) as the most abundant transfer product. To find the active-site amino acid residues which can affect the reactivity and regiospecificity of the glucosyl transfer, 16 mutants with amino acid substitutions near the active site were allowed to react with 1.75 M sucrose at 60 degrees C, pH 6.0, and the course of transglucosylation as well as the product specificity were analyzed. The sites of the amino acid substitutions were selected by comparing the conserved amino acid sequences located near the active site of the SAM1606 enzyme with those of the Bacillus oligo-1,6-glucosidases (O16G), which have very high amino acid sequence similarities near the active site but have a distinct substrate specificity. The results showed that, among the mutated SAM1606 enzymes examined, only the mutants with substitution of Gly273 with Pro showed an altered reactivity and specificity of transglucosylation; these mutants exhibited a significantly enhanced initial velocity of glucosyl transfer, yielding isomelezitose (6-O(F)-glucosylsucrose) instead of theanderose as the major transfer product. These results indicate that the substitution of Gly273 with Pro critically governs the enhanced reactivity and altered specificity of the transglucosylation. The notion that the amino acid residue at this position is the determinant of the glucosyl-transfer specificity was further confirmed by observation that the Bacillus cereus O16G, which has a proline at the corresponding position, produced isomelezitose as the major transfer product during transglucosylation with sucrose.
TI  - [Microbiologic evaluation of enteral diets handled in a hospital].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the microbiological quality of open enteral feeding system manipulated in a specialized hospital in oncology in the city of Natal-RN. METHODS: 20 samples of industrialized enteral feeding in open system had been analyzed. The searched microrganisms had been: Bacillus cereus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, mesophilic aerobic bacteria and coagulase positive Staphylococci. The methodology used for accomplishment of the microbiological analyses was the praised one for the Food and Drug Administration--FDA. RESULTS: It was evidenced total coliforms, Escherichia coli and mesophilic aerobic bacteria contamination in 25%, 10% and 20% of the analyzed samples, respectively. It was not identified the presence of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, and coagulase positive Staphylococci in none of the analyzed samples. CONCLUSION: The gotten results show that the enteral feedings are in unsatisfactory hygienic-sanitary conditions, evidencing the necessity of a bigger control in the manipulation of the same ones.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in Brazil.
AB  - Sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in Brazil. Thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of Minas Gerais. The samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, Bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). Lactobacillus perolans and Lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. Galactomyces geothricum and Issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). A species similar to Candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. Mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. B. cereus was found at low numbers in product at both factories. The spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  - Biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (HDM). We characterized biosurfactant producing microbial populations from a Long Beach soil, California (USA) and a Hong Kong soil (China), contaminated with diesel oil. A total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. Twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. The highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of L1, L2 and L3 isolates from a Long Beach soil (41.4mN m(-1)). Isolate L1 (Acinetobacter junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5 mN m(-1)). The emulsifying capacity evaluated by the E24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate L5 (74%). No substantial emulsification was achieved with the cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. Based on surface tension and the E24 index results, isolates F1, F2, F3, F4, L1, L2, L3 and L4 were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus sphaericus, B. fusiformis, Acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. and B. pumilus, respectively. Cluster analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. Five isolates (isolates F1, F2, F3, F4 and L4) belong to the Firmicutes order, two isolates (L1 and L3) belong to the Proteobacteria order and one isolate (L2) is an Actinomyces sp. Simpson's index (1 - D) and the Shannon-Weaver index (H) revealed more diversity of HDM in the Hong Kong soil, while evenness (E) and the equitability (J) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. Bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.
TI  - [Expression and bioactive characterization of bacteriophage lysin gene of Bacillus anthracis in Escherichia coli].
AB  - The lysin gene of Bacillus anthracis-diagnosing bacteriophage, obtained by PCR amplification,was cloned into the Escherichia coli exepression vector pET22b which has been cleaved by EcoR I and Nde I. The recombinant vector pET22b-gamma lysin was verified to be correctly constructed by PCR, sequencing and enzyme digestion, and highly expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), which accounted for about 40 percent of total protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3), while in the 5L fermentor the expression level reached 15g/L. After expression, disruption and purification with three-step chromatography, Streamline SP, SP HP and Sephacryl S-100, the recombinant gamma lysin was finally obtained with purity of higher than 95 percent as determined by gel scan. The final yield following SP HP was 19.1 percent, with a greater-than-350-fold increase in specific activity. The pure enzyme has been shown active to Bacillus anthracis, and not to E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Its specific activity was about 1400 u/mg.
TI  - Chromium-resistant bacteria and cyanobacteria: impact on Cr(VI) reduction potential and plant growth.
AB  - Two chromium-resistant bacterial strains, Bacillus cereus S-6 and Ochrobactrum intermedium CrT-1, and two cyanobacterial strains, Oscillatoria sp. and Synechocystis sp., were used in this study. At initial chromate concentrations of 300 and 600 microg K2CrO4 mL(-1), and an inoculum size of 9.6 x 10(7) cells mL(-1), B. cereus S-6 completely reduced Cr(VI), while O. intermedium CrT-1 reduced Cr(VI) by 98% and 70%, respectively after 96 h. At 100 microg K2CrO4 mL(-1), Synechocystis sp. MK(S) and Oscillatoria sp. BJ2 reduced 62.1% and 39.9% of Cr(VI), respectively, at 30 degrees C and pH 8. Application of hexavalent chromate salts adversely affected wheat seedling growth and anatomical characters. However, bacterial inoculation alleviated the toxic effects, as reflected by significant improvements in growth as well as anatomical parameters. Cyanobacterial strains also led to some enhancement of various growth parameters in wheat seedlings.
TI  - Eremophilane-type sesquiterpene derivatives from Senecio aegyptius var. discoideus.
AB  - Investigation of a CH(2)Cl(2) extract of the aerial parts of Senecio aegyptius var. discoideus afforded nine eremophilane compounds, of which six are new (1-6), namely, 1beta-hydroxy-8alphaH-eremophil-7(11),9-dien-8beta,12-olide (1), 1beta,8alpha-dihydroxyeremophil-7(11),9-dien-8beta,12-olide (2), 1beta-hydroxy-8alpha-methoxyeremophil-7(11),9-dien-8beta,12-olide (3), 1-oxo-8alpha-methoxy-10alphaH-eremophil-7(11)-en-8beta,12-lactam (4), 1beta,10beta-epoxy-8alpha-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-8beta,12-olide (5), and 1beta,10beta-epoxy-8alpha-methoxyeremophil-7(11)-en-8beta,12-olide (6). The structures of 1-6 were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and by comparison with literature data. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds was tested against Bacillus cereus and a Serratia sp.
TI  - Antagonistic effects of several bacteria on Fusarium oxysporum, the causal agent  of root and crown rot of onion under field conditions.
AB  - Onion (Allium cepa) is one of the most important vegetable crop which is commonly used as a food supplement. This plant is found to be vulnerable to various pathogenic infections during its growth development. Among different onion diseases, root and crown rot,caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cepa, s considered an importantfungal disease. In this study, the inhibitory effect of Bacillus cereus (isolates 22 and 52), B. subtilis (isolate 126), Pseudomonas fluorescens (isolates 48 and CHAO), benomyl fungicide and a combination of isolates CHAO and 22 and isolate 52 and benomyl were investigated on disease development under the field condition. This experiment was carried out in a randomize complete blocks with 10 treatments and three repetitions. Grouping of treatments was done at 5% level using Duncan multiple comparison test. It was also demonstrated that isolate 126 was the most effective antagonist with regard to crop yield but other treatments despite showing significant on plant growth factors were less effective in increasing crop yield.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16.
AB  - The strain Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (Bac217; approximately 7 kDa). The onset of Bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees C, respectively, when culture entered the early stationary phase. Biochemical characterization showed that Bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of pH 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees C for 6 months or -20 degrees C for up to 12 months. However, Bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. BGBUK2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. Plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for Bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. Bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Interestingly, Bac217 showed activity against Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853. The inhibitory effect of BGBUK2-16 on the growth of S. aureus in mixed culture was observed. S. aureus treatment with Bac217 led to a considerable decrease (CFU/ml) within a short period of time. The mode of Bac217 action on S. aureus was identified as bactericidal. It should be noted that the strain BGBUK2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.
TI  - Cloning, recombinant expression and biochemical characterisation of novel esterases from Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba.
AB  - Two novel esterases (EstB1 and EstB2) were isolated from a genomic library of Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba. EstB1 shows low identity (26-44%) with the published hydrolases of the genus Bacillus, whereas EstB2 shows high identity (73-74%) with the carboxylesterases from B. cereus and B. anthracis. Both esterases were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of T7 promoter using the vector pET-22b(+). Recombinant EstB1 was purified in a single step to electrophoretic homogeneity by IMAC. A method for the refolding of inclusion bodies formed by the recombinant EstB2 was established to obtain active enzyme. Substrate specificity of the two enzymes towards p-nitrophenyl and methyl esters and the respective kinetic parameters K(m) and V(max) were determined. The temperature optima of EstB1 and EstB2 were determined to be in the range of 30-50 degrees C and 20-35 degrees C, respectively. The pH optima were found to be in the range of 6.5-7.5 and 6.5-8.0, respectively. Both enzymes showed the highest stability in up to 50% (v/v) DMSO followed by methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. The influence of high NaCl and KCl concentrations was tested. The inhibition effect of 10-50 mM Zn(2+) and 50 mM Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) ions was observed for both esterases. One to five millimolar PMSF deactivated the enzymes, whereas beta-mercaptoethanol, DTT and EDTA had no effect on the enzymes activity.
TI  - Description of heterotrophic bacteria occurring in paper mills and paper products.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate aerobic mesophilic bacilli and thermophilic bacteria from different paper mill samples and to evaluate their potential harmfulness. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 109 mesophilic and 68 thermophilic isolates were purified and characterized by automated ribotyping and partial 16S rDNA sequencing. The mesophilic isolates belonged to the genera Bacillus (13 taxa), Brevibacillus (three taxa) and Paenibacillus (five taxa). The thermophilic bacteria represented seven taxa of Bacillus, Geobacillus or Paenibacillus, four of proteobacteria and one of actinobacteria. The most frequently occurring bacteria were Bacillus cereus, B. licheniformis, Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis and bacteria closely related to Paenibacillus stellifer, P. turicensis or Leptothrix sp. One mill was contaminated throughout with bacteria of a novel mesophilic genus most closely related to Brevibacillus centrosporus and another with bacteria of a novel thermophilic genus most closely related to Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus. One B. cereus isolate producing haemolytic diarrhoeal enterotoxin was detected and all the tested B. licheniformis isolates produced a metabolite toxic to boar sperm cells. CONCLUSIONS: The bacilli and thermophilic bacteria isolated represent species which should not present occupational hazards in paper mill environments. The most harmful bacterium detected was B. licheniformis and potentially also B. cereus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge of the microbial diversity in a paper mill provides a rational basis for development of an effective controlling programme. A database constructed from the fingerprints generated using automated ribotyping helps to identify and trace the contamination routes of bacteria occurring in paper mills.
TI  - [Microbiological quality of minimally processed vegetable salads].
AB  - The microbiological condition of minimally processed vegetable salads (7-days durability) purchased in the retail network of Szczecin has been assessed. The study included 14 kinds of salads manufactured by two producers. The total count of mesophilic aerobic bacteria and their spores, aid-forming bacteria (lactobacilli), titre of coliforms, occurrence of pathogenic bacteria and counts of moulds and yeast were determined. No pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus) was detected in all salads. However contamination by saprophytic microorganisms was high in salads of both producers. Total count of mesophilic aerobic bacteria was higher than recommended level (> 10(5) cfu/g) in majority of salads. The high quantities of yeast (> 10(3) jtk/g) and lactobacilli (10(3)-10(5) fu/g) were also stated. The titre of coliforms was reduced (down to 0.01-0.0001 g). The count of moulds did not exceed 100 cfu/g in a most of samples. Moulds occurring in tested samples were represented mainly by Penicillium sp.
TI  - Quorum quenching: enzymatic disruption of N-acylhomoserine lactone-mediated bacterial communication in Burkholderia thailandensis.
AB  - Many species of gram-negative bacteria communicate by synthesizing, secreting, and responding to N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), a mechanism termed quorum sensing. Several investigations have characterized numerous AHL-degrading enzymes (AiiA lactonases) encoded by environmental isolates of Bacillus spp. The Burkholderia thailandensis quorum system is comprised of at least three AHL synthases (AHSs) and five transcriptional regulators belonging to the LuxIR class of proteins. Expression of the Bacillus anthracis (Ames strain) AiiA lactonase in B. thailandensis completely abolished the accumulation of N-decanoylhomoserine lactone (C(10)-HSL) and N-octanoylhomoserine lactone (C(8)-HSL), reduced N-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (C(6)-HSL) levels, altered both swarming and twitching motility, caused a significant increase in generation time, and affected carbon metabolism. In contrast, heterologous expression of the Bacillus cereus strain A24 AiiA lactonase in B. thailandensis reduced the concentrations of C(6)-HSL, C(8)-HSL, and C(10)-HSL to nondetectable levels; altered both swarming and twitching motility; and caused fluctuations in carbon utilization. Individual disruption of the B. thailandensis AHSs, specifically disruption of the btaI1 and btaI3 genes, which encode the proteins that direct the synthesis of C(8)-HSL and C(6)-HSL, respectively, caused the hyper-beta-hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes on blood agar plates. In contrast, AHL cleavage in B. thailandensis by the Bacillus AiiA lactonases failed to enhance beta-hemolytic activity. The results of this study demonstrate that heterologous expression of Bacillus sp. AiiA lactonases in B. thailandensis reduced AHL accumulation, affected both swarming and twitching motility, increased generation time, altered substrate utilization, and prevented the beta-hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes.
TI  - Thermophilic, reversible gamma-resorcylate decarboxylase from Rhizobium sp. strain MTP-10005: purification, molecular characterization, and expression.
AB  - We found the occurrence of thermophilic reversible gamma-resorcylate decarboxylase (gamma-RDC) in the cell extract of a bacterium isolated from natural water, Rhizobium sp. strain MTP-10005, and purified the enzyme to homogeneity. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be about 151 kDa by gel filtration, and that of the subunit was 37.5 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; in other words, the enzyme was a homotetramer. The enzyme was induced specifically by the addition of gamma-resorcylate to the medium. The enzyme required no coenzyme and did not act on 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 2-hydroxybenzoate, or 3-hydroxybenzoate. It was relatively thermostable to heat treatment, and its half-life at 50 degrees C was estimated to be 122 min; furthermore, it catalyzed the reverse carboxylation of resorcinol. The values of k(cat)/K(m) (mMu(-1) . s(-1)) for gamma-resorcylate and resorcinol at 30 degrees C and pH 7 were 13.4 and 0.098, respectively. The enzyme contains 327 amino acid residues, and sequence identities were found with those of hypothetical protein AGR C 4595p from Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 (96% identity), 5-carboxyvanillate decarboxylase from Sphingomonas paucimobilis (32%), and 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylases from Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 (26%), Rattus norvegicus (26%), and Homo sapiens (25%). The genes (graA [1,230 bp], graB [888 bp], and graC [1,056 bp]) that are homologous to those in the resorcinol pathway also exist upstream and downstream of the gamma-RDC gene. Judging from these results, the resorcinol pathway also exists in Rhizobium sp. strain MTP-10005, and gamma-RDC probably catalyzes a reaction just before the hydroxylase in it does.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Mesophilic aerobic degradation of a metal lubricant by a biological consortium.
AB  - The metal-forming industries require the use of greases to lubricate metal surfaces during manufacturing operations, and the residues of these lubricants must be removed prior to finishing processes to protect and improve the appearance of the final product. An aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (pH 9, 42 degrees C) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. This process was characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. The metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. The maximum degradation rate Vmax and the apparent Km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively. Mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the evolved CO2 and Cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant concentration). The active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were identified as Bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3, 5, and 7.5 vol%), Bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhizobiaceae strain M100, and Achromobacter sp. LMG 5431 at 0.3 vol%.
TI  - Cloning and partial characterization of zwittermicin A resistance gene cluster from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD1.
AB  - AIM: The study seeks to shed light on the aminopolyol, broad-spectrum antibiotic  zwittermicin A gene cluster of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD1 and to identify any new uncharacterized genes with an eventual goal to establish a better understanding of the resistance gene cluster. METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened 51 serovars of B. thuringiensis by PCR and identified 12 zmaR-positive strains. The zmaR-positive B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD1 strain displayed inhibition zones against indicator fungal strain Phytophthora meadii and bacterial strain Erwinia herbicola as well as against Rhizopus sp., Xanthomonas campestris and B. thuringiensis subsp. finitimus. The zmaR gene cluster of strain HD1 was partially cloned using a lambda library and was extensively characterized based on the information available from a study performed on a similar group of genes in Bacillus cereus. CONCLUSIONS: Three of the five genes in the zwittermicin gene cluster, including the zmaR gene, had counterparts in B. cereus, and the other two were new members of the B. thuringiensis zmaR gene cluster. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The two new genes were extensively analysed and the data is presented. Understanding antifungal activity of B. thuringiensis may help us to design suitable Cry toxin delivery agents with antifungal activity as well as enhanced insecticidal activity.
TI  - [Organic extracts with antimicrobian activity from Penicillium sp. (Moniliales) isolated from the sponge Ircinia felix (Porifera: Demospongiae)].
AB  - This research expresses the potential of the bacterial activity present in the organic extracts obtained from Penicillium sp., isolated from the esponge Irciniafelix. This activity was evaluated through agar diffusion test and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). The susceptibility trials of organic fractions were carried out against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis. The use of the chromatographic techniques (CLV and TLC), permitted to obtain bioactive organic extracts of different polarities, of which only the EtOAc and MeOH fractions inhibited the growth of the bacteria used. Of the EtOAc fractionation, only fraction number 3 EtOAc/Hex presented greatest activity against the Gram-positive bacteria. Number 1 EtOAc/Hex fraction increased its activity against S. aureus (24 mm) and S. epidermidis (25 mm), which can be explained by the loss of possible antagonistic effect during the fractionation process. The CMI trials were carried out for the EtOAc number I subfraction against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus and B. subtilis, wich was clinical interest, and shows the potential of this organic extract as antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Cytoplasmic membrane polarization in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria grown in the absence and presence of tetracycline.
AB  - The ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to estimate membrane polarization values. However, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. The cytoplasmic membrane polarization values for Arthrobacter sp. ATCC 21908, Bacillus cereus NRC 3045, Pseudomonas fluorescens R2F, Pseudomonas putida NRC 2986 and Escherichia coli C600 bacterial cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees C, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. At an assay temperature of 10 degrees C, E. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for B. cereus, Arthrobacter sp., P. fluorescens and P. putida. At an assay temperature of 30 degrees C, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. B. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. Regardless of the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees C. To our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Rugulotrosins A and B: Two new antibacterial metabolites from an Australian isolate of a Penicillium sp.
AB  - Two new antibacterial agents, rugulotrosin A (1) and B (2), were obtained from cultures of a Penicillium sp. isolated from soil samples acquired near Sussex Inlet, New South Wales, Australia. Rugulotrosin A (1) is a chiral symmetric dimer, and its relative stereostructure was determined by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Rugulotrosin B (2) is a chiral asymmetric dimer isomeric with 1. Its structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis with comparison to the co-metabolite 1 and previously reported fungal metabolites. Both rugulotrosins A and B displayed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, while rugulotrosin A was also strongly active against Enterococcus faecalis and B. cereus.
TI  - [Microbiological quality of muesli samples purchased in retail network].
AB  - The estimation of microbiological quality of muesli samples was the aim of this investigation. The study included 40 samples which represented various consignments of muesli, produced in 2002 year. Total number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and moulds, and also occurrence of pathogenic bacteria, coliforms and enterococci were determined. The systematic units of muesli fungal flora have been identified. It was stated that microbiological quality of all tested muesli was good. No pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) was detected and also coliforms and enterococci titre was correct (> 0.1 g). A majority of samples characterized low contamination levels of mesophilic aerobic bacteria and fungi, and their total number did not exceed, suitably 10(3) and 10(2) cfu/g. The mesophilic aerobic bacteria were mainly represented by vegetative forms. The average share of these bacteria spores in total number of bacteria received 30%. The Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp. were regular elements of muesli fungal flora.
TI  - Deciphering the molecular basis of the broad substrate specificity of alpha-glucosidase from Bacillus sp. SAM1606.
AB  - The alpha-glucosidase of Bacillus sp. strain SAM1606 is a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 13, and shows an extraordinarily broad substrate specificity and is one of very few alpha-glucosidases that can efficiently hydrolyze the alpha-1,1-glucosidic linkage of alpha,alpha'-trehalose (trehalose). Phylogenetic analysis of family-13 enzymes suggests that SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase may be evolutionally derived from an alpha-1,6-specific ancestor, oligo-1,6-glucosidase (O16G). Indeed, replacement of Pro(273*) and Thr(342*) of B. cereus O16G by glycine and asparagine (the corresponding residues in the SAM1606 enzyme), respectively, was found to cause 192-fold enhancement of the relative catalytic efficiency for trehalose, suggesting that O16G may easily "evolved" into an enzyme with an extended substrate specificity by substitution of a limited number of amino acids, including that at position 273* (an asterisk indicates the amino-acid numbering of the SAM1606 sequence). To probe the role of the amino acid at position 273* of alpha-glucosidase in determination of the substrate specificity, the amino acid at position 273 of SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase was replaced by all other naturally occurring amino acids, and the resultant mutants were kinetically characterized. The results showed that substitution of bulky residues (e.g., isoleucine and methionine) for glycine at this position resulted in large increases in the K(m) values for trehalose and maltose, whereas the affinity to isomaltose was only minimally affected by such an amino-acid substitution at this position. Three-dimensional structural models of the enzyme-substrate complexes of the wild-type and mutant SAM1606 alpha-glucosidases were built to explore the mechanism responsible for these observations. It is proposed that substitution by glycine at position 273* could eliminate steric hindrance around subsite +1 that originally occurred in parental O16G and is, at least in part, responsible for the acquired broad substrate specificity of SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase.
TI  - Microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  - Bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. It is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signals. In this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of AHL-producing and AHL-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. We showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter agglomerans, produced AHL signals. We also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., Agrobacterium tumefaciens XJ01, Bacillus cereus XJ08, and Ralstonia sp. XJ12, expressed AHL degradation enzymes. Furthermore, we showed that P. aeruginosa isolate HL43 was virulent against animal model Caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than P. aeruginosa strains PA01 and PA14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. These data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.
TI  - [Studies on the parasites of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis].
AB  - Two bacteria and three fungi were isolated from the hypogeal stems of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis. The bacteria were identified as Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas alcaligenes, and the fungi were identified as Periconia sp., Pachnocybe albida and Hormomyces paridiphilus. The results on liquid culture of B. cereus, P. alcaligenes and H. paridiphilus indicated that the colloidization and polysaccharide content increasing in hypogeal stems of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis were due to the extracellular polysaccharide secretion of the parasitical fungus H. paridiphilus.
TI  - Lethal factor to mice produced by Escherichia coli isolated from chickens with swollen head syndrome.
AB  - A lethal toxin similar to Bacillus cererus lethal toxin was detected in the culture supernatants of Escherichia coli isolated from chickens with swollen head syndrome. The lethal activity was heat-labile, protease-sensitive and killed mice within 10 min. The light microscopy of the histopathological studies revealed that the principal organ affected by this toxin was the lung but the liver and kidneys also showed lesions. The relevance of this lethal activity from E. coli remains to be determined.
TI  - Cytotoxic potential of industrial strains of Bacillus sp.
AB  - The cytotoxic potential of selected strains of Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Bacillus subtilis, used in the production of industrial enzyme products, has been assessed. Cytotoxicity was determined in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells by measuring total cellular metabolic activity using the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Initially the MTT assay was validated against toxigenic strains of Bacillus cereus, to define the exact criteria for a toxigenic versus a nontoxigenic response. The assay proved sensitive to culture broths of both a diarrheagenic strain and an emetic strain of B. cereus. The enzyme-producing strains tested were nontoxic to CHO-K1 cells. Additionally it was demonstrated that our industrial strains did not react with antibodies against B. cereus enterotoxins by use of commercial antibody-based kits from Oxoid and Tecra. A short survey of the literature concerning the toxigenic potential of species within the subtilis group is included, as is a database search of known B. cereus enterotoxins against B. subtilis and B. licheniformis DNA sequences.
TI  - Diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with Xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  - Citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) is caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all Citrus sinensis cultivars. The endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and CVC-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. The endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as Bacillus pumilus, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Methylobacterium spp. (including Methylobacterium extorquens, M. fujisawaense, M. mesophilicum, M. radiotolerans, and M. zatmanii), Nocardia sp., Pantoea agglomerans, and Xanthomonas campestris. We observed a relationship between CVC symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of Methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. In contrast, we isolated C. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of CVC while P. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (Citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (C. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of CVC. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total plant DNA resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that DGGE profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. However, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. A specific band with a high G+C ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. The higher frequency of C. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to CVC.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Detection of enterotoxin genes in mosquito-larvicidal Bacillus species.
AB  - The presence of the B component of hemolysin BL (hblA), enterotoxin BceT (bceT),  and enterotoxin S (entS) genes in mosquito-larvicidal Bacillus sp., including 25 B. sphaericus and 4 B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis strains, has been analyzed by multiplex PCR in this study. The results showed that all four B. thuringiensis strains contain the hblA gene and the sequences of bceT and entS genes. However, none of the enterotoxin gene sequences were detected in the B. sphaericus strains. The enterotoxin production in all strains has also been analyzed by using two commercial immunoassay kits (TECRA and RPLA), and it has been proved that all the B. thuringiensis strains and one B. cereus strain can produce enterotoxins during growth. No enterotoxin activity could be detected in B. sphaericus strains.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated Bacillus sp. Strain 8 A.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by Bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus 8 A was identified. The antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. A crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and several species of Bacillus. Clinically relevant bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. Bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees C, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees C. It was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase K and pronase E. Bacteriocin activity was observed in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. CONCLUSIONS: A bacteriocin produced by Bacillus cereus 8 A was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - Large-scale screening of nasal swabs for Bacillus anthracis: descriptive summary  and discussion of the National Institutes of Health's experience.
AB  - In October 2001, a letter containing a large number of anthrax spores was sent through the Brentwood post office in Washington, D.C., to a United States Senate office on Capitol Hill, resulting in contamination in both places. Several thousand people who worked at these sites were screened for spore exposure by collecting nasal swab samples. We describe here a screening protocol which we, as a level A laboratory, used on very short notice to process a large number of specimens (3,936 swabs) in order to report preliminary results as quickly as possible. Six isolates from our screening met preliminary criteria for Bacillus anthracis identification and were referred for definitive testing. Although none of the isolates was later confirmed to be B. anthracis, we studied these isolates further to define their biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA sequences. Four of the six isolates were identified as Bacillus megaterium, one was identified as Bacillus cereus, and one was an unidentifiable Bacillus sp. Our results suggest that large-scale nasal-swab screening for potential exposure to anthrax spores, particularly if not done immediately postexposure, may not be very effective for detecting B. anthracis but may detect a number of Bacillus spp. that are phenotypically very similar to B. anthracis.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in Latin American patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (ReA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the 16S ribosomal RNA-PCR method was used to identify bacterial DNA in synovial fluid (SF) and tissue (ST) in a well defined group of patients with chronic ReA. In addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. METHODS: We examined 15 ST and 5 SF samples of 15 patients with ReA, 5 ST samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and 8 SF from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested PCR with universal 16S rRNA primers. In addition, a nested PCR was developed to detect DNA sequences of Salmonella sp. and Mycoplasma sp. Automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (GenBank) were also performed to identify the species. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was identified in 8 cases, 5 ST and 3 SF; Chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), Pseudomonas sp. (n = 3), and Bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. A variety of microorganisms including Clostridium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Pseudomonas migulae, P. fluorescens, and P. putida, and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B were also identified. In half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3 bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. CONCLUSION: Bacterial DNA is present in the joints in patients with chronic ReA. A wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with ReA were identified. Further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of ReA and related arthritides.
TI  - Purification, characterization and cloning of a chitinase from Bacillus sp. NCTU2.
AB  - A chitin-degrading Bacillus strain, designated as NCTU2, was screened from soil and identified. An extracellular chitinase was purified to >90% homogeneity from the culture filtrate. The purification involved hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatographic separations with a yield of 58%. The purified enzyme (ChiNCTU2) is a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular mass of 36.5 kDa and a pI of 6.3. It is thermally stable at 60 degrees C and pH 6-8 for more than 3 h. The optimal activity is in the range of 50-60 degrees C at pH 7.0. Chitobiose is the predominant product throughout the enzymic hydrolysis of the colloidal chitin, indicating that the purified chitinase is an exo-chitinase. Chito-oligosaccharides [with degree of polymerization (DP) values of 4-6] are good substrates of the purified enzyme, whereas a DP3 oligomer was slowly hydrolysed to form DP1 and DP2 sugars. The first 15 N-terminal amino acids of the enzyme were determined to be ANNLGSKLLVGYWHN, which is highly homologous to that of ChiA from Bacillus cereus. A PCR cloning technique was employed to obtain the corresponding gene from Bacillus NCTU2. The gene sequence was determined to be 1080 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with the first 27 amino acids as the signal peptide.
TI  - Screening of soil bacteria for production of biocleaner.
AB  - Soil bacteria were studied for the production of biodegradable cleaning agents. Among 86 bacterial strains resistant to liquid paraffin, 58 showed hemolytic activity. These strains were cultured, and the supernatant of culture broths was evaluated for cleaning activity against a dirty porcelain tile. Potent activity was exhibited in 18 strains. The lowest value of surface tension was obtained from Bacillus sp. NKB03 suggesting the presence of a biosurfactant. Aeromonas sp. NKB26c and Bacillus cereus NKB46b exhibited enzymatic cleaning activity. A cleaning efficiency of 82% was achieved when using a mixture of supernatants from culture broths of Bacillus sp. NKB03 and Aeromonas sp. NKB26c in synthetic minimal media. The cleaning efficiency using this mixture was higher than that of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results suggest that a mixture of supernatants from culture broths of Bacillus sp. NKB03 and Aeromonas sp. NKB26c has potential for commercial use as a biocleaner.
TI  - Identification of quorum-quenching N-acyl homoserine lactonases from Bacillus species.
AB  - A range of gram-negative bacterial species use N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules as quorum-sensing signals to regulate different biological functions, including production of virulence factors. AHL is also known as an autoinducer. An autoinducer inactivation gene, aiiA, coding for an AHL lactonase, was cloned from a bacterial isolate, Bacillus sp. strain 240B1. Here we report identification of more than 20 bacterial isolates capable of enzymatic inactivation of AHLs from different sources. Eight isolates showing strong AHL-inactivating enzyme activity were selected for a preliminary taxonomic analysis. Morphological phenotypes and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis indicated that these isolates probably belong to the species Bacillus thuringiensis. Enzymatic analysis with known Bacillus strains confirmed that all of the strains of B. thuringiensis and the closely related species B. cereus and B. mycoides tested produced AHL-inactivating enzymes but B. fusiformis and B. sphaericus strains did not. Nine genes coding for AHL inactivation were cloned either by functional cloning or by a PCR procedure from selected bacterial isolates and strains. Sequence comparison of the gene products and motif analysis showed that the gene products belong to the same family of AHL lactonases.
TI  - Modified blasticidin S resistance gene (bsrm) as a selectable marker for construction of retroviral vectors.
AB  - Retroviral vectors are commonly used in ex vivo gene therapy protocols. The structure of vectors basically consists of one gene of interest and a selectable marker gene. Fast selection without damaging cells is a critical step for ex vivo gene therapy protocols. Blasticidin S deaminase isolated from Bacillus cereus has a neutralizing action on the highly toxic antibiotic blasticidin S (BS). A commercially available gene coding for blasticidin S deaminase (bsr) when used to construct retroviral vectors, LBSN and LNSB, provided very low levels of BS deaminase activity, precluding their routine use in gene transfer experiments. However, with the introduction of specific mutations into the bsr gene based on the Kozak consensus sequences and deletion of a 5' untranslated sequence to generate bsrm, we were able to construct a retroviral vector encoding resistance to high doses of BS (at least 16-fold above the usual lethal dose in NIH3T3 cells), showing that bsrm/BS may provide a useful system for selection of transduced mammalian cells.
TI  - Selective enrichment and characterization of a phosphorus-removing bacterial consortium from activated sludge.
AB  - Under alternating aerobic/anaerobic conditions and without additional carbon sources, a bacterial consortium consisting initially of 18 bacterial strains was obtained in a sequence batch reactor. The phosphorus removal capability could only be maintained using sterile filtrate of activated sludge as medium. The addition of calcium and magnesium salts, as well as vitamins and trace elements, to autoclaved sterile filtrate of activated sludge was not sufficient to achieve stable phosphorus removal. A further enrichment by subcultivation on solid, agar, freezing, and shortening of the aerobic and anaerobic phases led to a defined bacterial consortium consisting of four strains. On the basis of physiological and chemotaxonomic characterization, and partial 16S rRNA sequencing, one of the organisms was identified as Delftia acidovorans. A further isolate belonged to the Bacillus cereus group, and the third isolate was identified as Microbacterium sp.. The remaining strain seems to represent a new genus within the Flavobacteriaceae. Under continuous chemostat conditions, this consortium was able to remove up to 9.6 mg P/l phosphate in the aerobic phase and released up to 8.5 mg/l in the anaerobic phase. Up to 25 mg P-polyphosphate/g dry mass was stored under aerobic conditions.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of Mn(2+)-dependent sphingomyelinase/hemolysin of an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4. The sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. The recombinant 57.7-kDa enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase C. The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at pH 8.0 and activated by Mn(2+). The enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and NBD-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. Significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria ivanovii, and Leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical protein encoded in Chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the C terminus of the TK4 enzyme. Interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain TK4 lacking 186 amino acids at the C-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the C-terminal region of the TK4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.
TI  - [Dynamic of the volume and structure of the soil bacterial complex in the presence of azobenzene].
AB  - Azobenzene exerted no significant effect on the dynamics and the species composition of the saprophytic soil bacterial complex, which remained almost the same as in the control and was characterized by the predominance of Curtobacterium sp., Arthrobacter globiformis, and Bacillus megaterium in all stages of succession. Some heterotrophic bacteria were found to be able to accumulate azobenzene. Bac. cereus and Bac. polymyxa degraded azobenzene during their cultivation in nutrient media.
TI  - Molecular microbial diversity of a spacecraft assembly facility.
AB  - In ongoing investigations to map and archive the microbial footprints in various  components of the spacecraft and its accessories, we have examined the microbial populations of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF). Witness plates made up of spacecraft materials, some painted with spacecraft qualified paints, were exposed for approximately 7 to 9 months at JPL-SAF and examined the particulate materials collected for the incidence of total cultivable aerobic heterotrophs and heat-tolerant (80 degrees C for 15-min.) spore-formers. The results showed that the witness plates coated with spacecraft qualified paints attracted more dust particles than the non-coated stainless steel witness plates. Among the four paints tested, witness plates coated with NS43G accumulated the highest number of particles, and hence attracted more cultivable microbes. The conventional microbiological examination revealed that the JPL-SAF harbors mainly Gram-positive microbes and mostly spore-forming Bacillus species. Most of the isolated microbes were heat resistant to 80 degrees C and proliferate at 60 degrees C. The phylogenetic relationships among 23 cultivable heat-tolerant microbes were examined using a battery of morphological, physiological, molecular and chemotaxonomic characterizations. By 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the isolates fell into seven clades: Bacillus licheniformis, B. pumilus, B. cereus, B. circulans, Staphylococcus capitis, Planococcus sp. and Micrococcus lylae. In contrast to the cultivable approach, direct DNA isolation, cloning and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis revealed equal representation of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Kinetic study of two novel enantiomeric tricyclic beta-lactams which efficiently  inactivate class C beta-lactamases.
AB  - A detailed kinetic study of the interaction between two ethylidene derivatives of tricyclic carbapenems, Lek 156 and Lek 157, and representative beta-lactamases and D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidases (DD-peptidases) is presented. Both compounds are very efficient inactivators of the Enterobacter cloacae 908R beta-lactamase, which is usually resistant to inhibition. Preliminary experiments indicate that various extended-spectrum class C beta-lactamases (ACT-1, CMY-1, and MIR-1) are also inactivated. With the E. cloacae 908R enzyme, complete inactivation occurs with a second-order rate constant, k(2)/K', of 2 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), and reactivation is very slow, with a half-life of >1 h. Accordingly, Lek 157 significantly decreases the MIC of ampicillin for E. cloacae P99, a constitutive class C beta-lactamase overproducer. With the other serine beta-lactamases tested, the covalent adducts exhibit a wide range of stabilities, with half-lives ranging from long (>4 h with the TEM-1 class A enzyme), to medium (10 to 20 min with the OXA-10 class D enzyme), to short (0.2 to 0.4 s with the NmcA class A beta-lactamase). By contrast, both carbapenems behave as good substrates of the Bacillus cereus metallo-beta-lactamase (class B). The Streptomyces sp. strain R61 and K15 extracellular DD-peptidases exhibit low levels of sensitivity to both compounds.
TI  - Class II broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in Gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.
AB  - We have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among Bacillus and related species. This mer determinant was first described in Bacillus cereus RC607 from Boston Harbor, USA, and was then found in various Bacillus and related species in Japan, Russia and England. We have shown that the mer determinant can either be located at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the Bacillus species, and is carried by class II mercury resistance transposons: Tn5084 from B. cereus RC607 and B. cereus VKM684 (ATCC10702) and Tn5085 from Exiguobacterium sp. TC38-2b. Tn5085 is identical in nucleotide sequence to TnMERI1, the only other known mer transposon from Bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like TnMERI1. Tn5085 is functionally active in Escherichia coli. Tn5083, which we have isolated from B. megaterium MK64-1, contains an RC607-like mer determinant, that has lost some mercury resistance genes and possesses a merA gene which is a novel sequence variant that has not been previously described. Tn5083 and Tn5084 are recombinants, and are comprised of fragments from several transposons including Tn5085, and a relative of a putative transposon from B. firmus (which contains similar genes to the cadmium resistance operon of Staphylococcus aureus), as well as others. The sequence data showed evidence for recombination both between transposition genes and between mer determinants.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity to UV-B radiation of two Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies and other Bacillus sp.
AB  - Susceptibility of Bacillus thuringiensis spores and toxins to the UV-B range (280--330 nm) of the solar spectrum reaching Earth's surface may be responsible for its inactivation and low persistence in nature. Spores of the mosquito larvicidal B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis were significantly more resistant to UV-B than spores of the lepidopteran-active subsp. kurstaki. Spores of subsp. israelensis were as resistant to UV-B as spores of B. subtilis and more resistant than spores of the closely related B. cereus and another mosquito larvicidal species B. sphaericus. Sensitivity of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis spores to UV-B radiation depended upon their culture age; 24-h cultures, approaching maximal larvicidal activity, were still sensitive. Maximal resistance to UV-B was achieved only at 48 h.
TI  - Variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  - Fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. The principal bacterial species isolated were Alcaligenes sp., Bacillus spp. (including B. cereus, B. lentus, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and B. subtilis), Burkholderia cepacia, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Methylobacterium extorquens, and Pantoea agglomerans, with P. agglomerans and B. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. The most abundant fungal species were Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Guignardia citricarpa, and Cladosporium sp. Genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, which indicated that B. pumilus isolates were more diverse than P. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. In vitro interaction studies between G. citricarpa isolates and the most frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by G. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some Bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on P. agglomerans.
TI  - Microbiological survey of retail herbs and spices from Mexican markets.
AB  - In the present study, 304 samples of herbs and spices (garlic powder, cumin seeds, black pepper, oregano, and bay leaves) widely used in Mexico were analyzed for the presence of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli, total and fecal coliforms, total mesophilic aerobic organisms, and fungi. Samples were nonpackaged or packaged in polyethylene bags or glass containers. High levels (10(5) to 10(7) CFU/g) of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms were found in most of the samples of garlic powder, cumin seed, and black pepper. Lower levels (<102 CFU/g) were found in oregano and bay leaves. Total and fecal coliforms counts were dependent on the type of packaging. More than 70% of the polyethylene-packaged samples had less than 10(3) CFU/g of microorganisms. Glass and nonpackaged spices showed lower levels of these microorganisms. B. cereus was present in 32 samples of which most were polyethylene packaged. The other pathogenic bacteria were not detected. Aspergillus niger was detected in 29% of the samples, Rhizopus sp. in 19%, and Penicillum sp. and Cunninghamella in 8%.
TI  - Bioactivity studies of extracts from Tridax procumbens.
AB  - An updated review on the biological activity of Tridax procumbens is presented. A detailed biological screening comprised of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi using crude extracts of this plant was undertaken. The n-hexane extract of the flowers showed activity against Escherichia coli. The same extract of the whole aerial parts was active against Mycobacterium smegmatis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Salmonella paratyphi. The ethyl-acetate extract of the flowers was active against Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella sp. The aerial parts extract also showed activity only against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus, while the aqueous extract showed no antimicrobial activity. None of the tested extracts was active against the yeasts, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula rubra; or the fungi: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp. and Trichophyton rubrum.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new adamantane derivatives II.
AB  - A series of new derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. The new compound 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantaneethanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride, as well as 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride, appeared very useful for preparation of a number of N-substituted phthalimides. Antimicrobial activity of newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-phenylalanyl)phthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-leucyl)-phthalimide was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus flavus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for these compounds against Bacillus cereus were 15 and 8 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial spore inhibition and inactivation in foods by pressure, chemical preservatives, and mild heat.
AB  - Sucrose laurates, sucrose palmitate, sucrose stearates, and monolaurin (Lauricidin) were evaluated for inhibitory effects against spores of Bacillus sp., Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and Alicyclobacillus sp. in a model agar system. The combined treatment of sucrose laurate, high hydrostatic pressure, and mild heat was evaluated on spores of Bacillus and Alicyclobacillus in foods. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the sucrose esters were higher than that of Lauricidin for all spores tested in the model agar system, but Lauricidin was not the most readily suspended in the test media. The sucrose laurates and sucrose palmitate were more effective and more readily suspended than the sucrose stearates. A combined treatment of sucrose laurate (<1.0%), 392 megaPascals (MPa) at 45 degrees C for 10 to 15 min provided 3- to 5.5-log10 CFU/ml reductions from initial populations of 10(6) CFU/ml for Bacillus subtilis 168 in milk, Bacillus cereus 14579 in beef, Bacillus coagulans 7050 in tomato juice (pH 4.5), Alicyclobacillus sp. N1089 in tomato juice (pH 4.5), and Alicyclobacillus sp. N1098 in apple juice. The most notable change in the appearance of the products was temporary foaming during mixing of the sucrose laurate in the foods. The effect of sucrose laurate appeared to be inhibitory rather than lethal to the spores. The inhibitory effects observed on Bacillus and Alicyclobacillus spores by the combined treatment of pressure, mild heat, and sucrose laurate appear promising for food applications where alternatives to high heat processing are desired.
TI  - Improvement of the detection of Listeria monocytogenes by the application of ALOA, a diagnostic, chromogenic isolation medium.
AB  - A new selective agar medium, ALOA, for the selective and differential isolation of Listeria monocytogenes has been evaluated. All stressed cultures of L. monocytogenes serovars tested grew on the medium as bluish colonies surrounded by a distinctive opaque halo and gave a productivity ratio of at least 0.95. Non-pathogenic Listeria sp. produced bluish colonies without a halo as was also the case for some enterococci and bacilli. Special attention must be paid to some Bacillus cereus strains and L. ivanovii since their colony appearance can be misleading. Only some unidentified listeria-like bacteria gave false-positive results. ALOA detected 4. 3% more positives from naturally contaminated dairy and meat samples compared with the ISO procedure when used with GenprobeTM or VidasTM for confirmation of presumptive colonies; 13.9% false negatives were found compared with 38.9% using PALCAM/Oxford. ALOA was also clearly superior to Oxford and PALCAM when samples containing both L. monocytogenes and L. innocua were examined. The introduction of ALOA in standard isolation procedures as an additional medium would enhance the detection ratio and reduce the time and cost of analysis for L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Two-enzyme system for the synthesis for 1-lauroyl-rac-glycerophosphate (lysophosphatidic acid) and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate.
AB  - A combination of two enzymes, phospholipase D (PL D) and C (PL C), was investigated for the production of two lysophospholipids, 1-lauroyl-rac-glycerophosphate (1-LGP) and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (1-LDHAP). The high transphosphatidylation ability of phospholipase D from Streptomyces sp. allowed the formation of 1-lauroyl-phosphatidylglycerol (1-LPG) and 1-lauroyl-phosphatidyldihydroxyacetone (1-LPDHA) from phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 1-monolauroyl-rac-glycerol (1-MLG) and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetone (1-MDHA), respectively. A two-phase system, diethyl ether/water, was chosen for the convenience of the recovery of the water insoluble products. A similar two-phase system was used for hydrolysis of the complex phospholipids by phospholipase C form Bacillus cereus, which released both lysophospholipids. Only trace amounts of phosphatidic acid (PA) were detected showing that the enzyme is highly selective for the release of the diacylglycerol and 1-lauroyl-rac-glycerophosphate and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Orobanche cernua extract.
AB  - The effect of the parasitic plant Orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; microgram/ml) of the extract was as follows: Staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; Streptococcus sp.-3125; Streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. Data indicated that the MIC of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against Streptococcus sp. and S. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against S. pyogenes and B. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against E. coli. It can be concluded that the O. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.
TI  - The Ba813 chromosomal DNA sequence effectively traces the whole Bacillus anthracis community.
AB  - Plasmid genes that are responsible for virulence of Bacillus anthracis are important targets for the DNA-based detection of anthrax. We evaluated the distribution of the Ba813 chromosomal DNA sequence (Ba813) within closely related Bacillus species. Ba813 was systematically identified from 47 strains or isolates of B. anthracis tested, thus indicating its reliability as a tracer for that species. From the 60 strains of closely related Bacillus spp. examined, three bona fide B. cereus and one bona fide B. thuringiensis were found to harbour Ba813. This marker was also detected in Bacillus sp. isolates that were present at high levels in soil samples collected in a place where an anthrax outbreak had occurred. The significance and the possible function of the Ba813 locus is discussed.
TI  - [Development from actions of bacterial phospholipases C on eucaryotic plasma membranes to molecular biology of GPI-anchored proteins].
AB  - Bacterial phospholipases C are known to act on biomembranes, since they can cleave the phosphodiester linkage between the polar head and the hydrophobic moiety of each phospholipid in these membranes. These enzymes have been classified into three groups; phosphatidylcholine (PC)-, sphingomyelin (SM)- and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-degrading phospholipases C. Enzymatic properties and toxicities of these phospholipases C are reviewed, in relation to author's research. Studies on the hemolytic phospholipases of Clostridium sp., Bacillus cereus etc., revealed that hydrolysis of choline-containing phospholipids such as PC and SM was responsible for the hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes by these enzymes in the presence of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+. Also, the studies on a structure-activity correlation of SM-hydrolyzing phospholipase C from B. cereus disclosed the similarity of active sites between this enzyme and bovine pancreatic DNase I. By action of PI-degrading phospholipases C, several membrane proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, VSG (protozoal surface glycoprotein) etc., were shown to be released from the plasma membranes of eucaryotic cells. From structural analysis, these proteins have been revealed to be glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins bound to the plasma membranes with carboxyl terminal-attached glycolipid. Biochemistry and molecular biology of GPI-anchored proteins, including the structures and biosynthetic routes of GPI glycolipids as well as the process of GPI attachment to proteins, requirements of C-terminal signal peptide for the protein modification by GPI, and distribution of GPI-anchored proteins in living world, are described in relation to our studies.
TI  - Characterization, production, and purification of leucocin H, a two-peptide bacteriocin from Leuconostoc MF215B.
AB  - Leuconostoc MF215B was found to produce a two-peptide bacteriocin referred to as  leucocin H. The two peptides were termed leucocin Halpha and leucocin Hbeta. When acting together, they inhibit, among others, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens. Production of leucocin H in growth medium takes place at temperatures down to 6 degrees C and at pH below 7. The highest activity of leucocin H in growth medium was demonstrated in the late exponential growth phase. The bacteriocin was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion-exchange (SP Sepharose) and reverse phase chromatography. Upon purification, specific activity increased 10(5)-fold, and the final specific activity was 2 x 10(7) BU/OD280. Amino acid composition analyses of leucocin Halpha and leucocin Hbeta indicated that both peptides consisted of around 40 amino acid residues. Their N-termini were blocked for Edman degradation, and the methionin residues of leucocin Hbeta did not respond to Cyanogen Bromide (CNBr) cleavage. Absorbance at 280 nm indicated the presence of tryptophan residues and tryptophan-fracturing opened for partial sequencing by Edman degradation. From leucocin Halpha, the sequence of 20 amino acids was obtained; from leucocin Hbeta the sequence of 28 amino acid residues was obtained. No sequence homology to other known bacteriocins could be demonstrated. It also appeared that the two peptides themselves shared little or no sequence homology. The presence of soy oil did not affect the activity of leucocin H in agar.
TI  - Evaluation of a modified enzymatic test for the detection of tetracyclines in milk.
AB  - The tetracycline galactosidase (TG) test, a new method for the detection of tetracycline residues in raw milk based on the inhibition of beta-galactosidase biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, was previously validated with spiked milk samples. It has now been applied to milk from cows treated with oxytetracycline. In view of the occurrence of false positives, related to highly elevated somatic cell counts (>10(6)/ml), the improved TG test was developed, in which a heating step (80 degrees C, 15 min) preceded the original TG test protocol. A good agreement with other assays (Delvotest SP, the Bacillus cereus microtiter test, the LacTek tetracycline milk screening test, the Charm HVS-8100 tetracycline test) as well as with high-pressure liquid chromatography was obtained. No false negatives were observed with reference to the established maximum residue limit for tetracyclines of 100 microg/kg milk.
TI  - Dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  - A total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. Several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: Sphingomonas, Brevibacterium, Nocardiopsis, Deinococcus and Rhodococcus/Gordona. A new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. The indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the Gram-negative genera Pseudomonas, Pantoea, Flavobacterium and Xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by Bacillus, Micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. The dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, Gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably Bacillus cereus, Brevibacillus brevis, B. licheniformis, B. subtilis and species of Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Rhodococcus/Gordona, Nocardiopsis sp., Deinococcus, Staphylococcus and Micrococcus. Indoor air and dust contained Klebsiella oxytoca, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Ac. lwoffi, Bacillus cereus and Nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group II. Indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). The 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl C16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. The dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-D-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.
TI  - Bacillus weihenstephanensis sp. nov. is a new psychrotolerant species of the Bacillus cereus group.
AB  - The Bacillus cereus group comprises the four valid species Bacillus cereus, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus anthracis. Some isolates of B. cereus are known to be psychrotolerant (growth at 7 degrees C or below). Here, specific sequence differences are described between the 16S rDNA, the 23S rDNA, the 16S-23S rDNA spacer region and the genes of the major cold-shock protein homologue cspA in a variety of psychrotolerant and mesophilic B. cereus and B. mycoides strains. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis using three different primers clearly separated psychrotolerant strains of both species from the rest of the B. cereus group, as did inverse PCR patterns of the rDNA operons. These data strongly support a hitherto unrecognized fifth sub-group within the B. cereus species group comprising psychrotolerant, but not mesophilic, B. cereus strains. Despite the latter finding, the DNA sequences investigated exhibited a high degree of sequence similarity indicating a close relationship between the species of the B. cereus group. Considering the unusual importance of B. cereus in both food poisoning and food spoilage and to avoid merging all species of the group, a new species, Bacillus weihenstephanensis sp. nov., comprising psychrotolerant 'cereus' strains, is proposed. Isolates of the new species grow at 4-7 degrees C but not at 43 degrees C and can be identified rapidly using rDNA or cspA targeted PCR. The type strain is B. weihenstephanensis WSBC 10204T (= DSM 11821T).
TI  - Bacillus pseudomycoides sp. nov.
AB  - Previous DNA relatedness studies showed that strains identified as Bacillus mycoides segregated into two genetically distinct yet phenotypically similar groups, one being B. mycoides sensu stricto and the other, an unclassified taxon. In the present study, the taxonomic position of this second group was assessed by measuring DNA relatedness and determining phenotypic characteristics of an increased number of B. mycoides strains. Also determined was the second group's 16S RNA gene sequence. The 36 B. mycoides strains studied segregated into two genetically distinct groups showing DNA relatedness of about 30%; 18 strains represented the species proper and 18 the second group with intragroup DNA relatedness for both groups ranging from 70 to 100%. DNA relatedness to the type strains of presently recognized species with G+C contents of approximately 35 mol% (Bacillus alcalophilus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus lentus, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus sphaericus) ranged from 22 to 37%. Although shown to be genetically distinct taxa, the two B. mycoides groups exhibited highly similar (98%) 16S RNA sequences. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both B. mycoides and the second group clustered closely with B. cereus. Although not distinguishable by physiological and morphological characteristics, the two B. mycoides groups and B. cereus were clearly separable based on fatty acid composition. The data established that the second B. mycoides group merits recognition as a new species for which the name Bacillus pseudomycoides is proposed. The type stain is NRRL B-617(T).
TI  - Biologically active polymers: synthesis and antimicrobial activity of modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers having a quaternary ammonium and phosphonium groups.
AB  - Polymers with antibacterial activity have been synthesized by chemical modification of poly(glycidyl methacrylate). The glycidyl methacrylate was polymerized by the free radical polymerization technique. The poly(glycidyl methacrylate) was hydrolyzed and was chloroacetylated using chloroacetyl chloride. The chloroacetylated product was modified to yield polymers with either quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts. The antimicrobial activity of the modified glycidyl methacrylate polymers has been examined against a variety of test microorganisms by the cut plug and the viable cell counting methods using shake flask of ten times diluted nutrient broth medium. All three polymers obtained were inhibitory to the growth of Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomones aeruginosa, Shigella sp. and Salmonella typhae) and Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and B. cereus) as well as the fungus (Trichophytun rubrum). It was found that the growth inhibitory effect varied according to the structure of the polymer and the composition of the active group and increased with increasing the concentration of the polymer. The tested polymers showed more antimicrobial activity against Gram negative bacteria and the fungus, whereas were less active against Gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.
TI  - A cysteine-dependent serine protease associated with the dormant spores of Bacillus cereus: purification of the protein and cloning of the corresponding gene.
AB  - Subtilisin-like serine protease, which is associated with the dormant spores of Bacillus cereus, was solubilized by washing the spores with 2 M KCl and purified to homogeneity by carbobenzoxy-D-phenylalanine-liganded affinity column chromatography and hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. Enzyme activity was completely inhibited by reagents for sulfhydryl groups such as HgCl2 as well as by conventional subtilisin inhibitors, suggesting the enzyme to be cysteine-dependent. The enzyme retained activity in 5 M urea at 4 degrees C for at least 2 months, and the specific activity was 50 times that of subtilisin BPN when measured for a common chromogenic substrate, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-glycyl-L-leucine p-nitroanilide. The gene encoding this protease was cloned in Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. The deduced amino acid sequence suggested that the protease is produced as a precursor comprising three portions; a signal sequence (28 amino acid residues), a prosequence (80 amino acid residues) and a mature enzyme (289 amino acid residues). The mature region of the enzyme had high similarity with a thermitase from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris (72% identity) and a thermostable alkaline protease from Thermoactinomyces sp. E79 (66% identity), which have the N-terminal sequence showing scarcely noticeable similarity with corresponding stretches of subtilisins and mercuric ion-sensitive free cysteine in the equivalent position of the primary structure.
TI  - Expression and purification of epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN) from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The expression of staphylococcal epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN), an ADP-ribosyltransferase targeting the small GTP-binding protein rho p21, was examined using Bacillus subtilis. A recombinant plasmid, containing B. licheniformis alpha-amylase promoter flanking either a beta-glucanase or a B. cereus sphingomyelinase signal sequence, and a DNA fragment corresponding to mature EDIN were constructed and used to transform B. subtilis KN2. Transformants were designated ED7 and ED8, respectively. ED7 extracellularly produced recombinant protein, which was purified to homogeneity through column chromatography using SP-Toyopearl 650 cation-exchange gel and the HA1000 hydroxyapatite HPLC column. ED8 did not grow in broth culture. Biochemical and biological studies of purified protein revealed that ED7 produced a correctly processed recombinant EDIN, indistinguishable from natural EDIN.
TI  - The Arthromitus stage of Bacillus cereus: intestinal symbionts of animals.
AB  - In the guts of more than 25 species of arthropods we observed filaments containing refractile inclusions previously discovered and named "Arthromitus" in 1849 by Joseph Leidy [Leidy, J. (1849) Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 4, 225-233]. We cultivated these microbes from boiled intestines of 10 different species of surface-cleaned soil insects and isopod crustaceans. Literature review and these observations lead us to conclude that Arthromitus are spore-forming, variably motile, cultivable bacilli. As long rod-shaped bacteria, they lose their flagella, attach by fibers or fuzz to the intestinal epithelium, grow filamentously, and sporulate from their distal ends. When these organisms are incubated in culture, their life history stages are accelerated by light and inhibited by anoxia. Characterization of new Arthromitus isolates from digestive tracts of common sow bugs (Porcellio scaber), roaches (Gromphodorhina portentosa, Blaberus giganteus) and termites (Cryptotermes brevis, Kalotermes flavicollis) identifies these flagellated, spore-forming symbionts as a Bacillus sp. Complete sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from four isolates (two sow bug, one hissing roach, one death's head roach) confirms these as the low-G+C Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus cereus. We suggest that B. cereus and its close relatives, easily isolated from soil and grown on nutrient agar, enjoy filamentous growth in moist nutrient-rich intestines of healthy arthropods and similar habitats.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of food-related Penicillium sp. against pathogenic bacteria in laboratory media and a cheese model system.
AB  - Food-related Penicillium species (n = 34) and Geotrichum candidum (n = 11) grown  on Czapek Dox and brie agar were tested for their ability to suppress growth of pathogenic bacteria. Ten out of 13 P. camemberti showed antagonistic activity while the other species did not interact significantly with the bacterial growth. The order of inhibition was: Gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus cereus > Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus sp. > Micrococcus sp. whereas Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus and some Micrococcus sp. were unaffected. When Salmonella typhimurium was inoculated together with P. camemberti P25 in brie agar, bacterial growth was inhibited during the first 6 d of incubation whereafter growth started. The inhibition of L. monocytogenes was similar but less pronounced. The antimicrobial activity produced by P. camemberti P25 and L84 was enhanced with increasing amount of sucrose in the medium. The activity was increased at low pH and destroyed at pH above 8. It was detectable at 15 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C indicating that volatile metabolites might be involved. No significant accumulation of organic acids and no secondary metabolites such as mycotoxins were detected. HSGC-MS analysis indicated that acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal and 1-octen-3-ol were produced by P. camemberti during the period when inhibitory activity was observed. Pure acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde were shown to be inhibitory to L. monocytogenes and Salm. typhimurium when grown at 15 degrees C and pH 5.5 and 7.0.
TI  - The use of Bacillus diarrhoeal enterotoxin (BDE) detection using an ELISA technique in the confirmation of the aetiology of Bacillus-mediated diarrhoea.
AB  - A commercially available ELISA kit was used for the detection of Bacillus diarrhoeal enterotoxin (BDE) in a variety of foods and faeces. The ability of isolates of Bacillus spp., including Bacillus cereus, to produce BDE in Brain Heart Infusion broth containing 0.1% glucose was also checked by use of the kit. Results show that 29 out of 31 B. cereus isolates were enterotoxigenic. Foods positive for performed BDE were always contaminated with > 10(5) B. cereus cfu g-1, but not all foods contaminated with large numbers of B. cereus were positive for BDE. Bacillus sp., other than one isolate which closely resembled B. subtilis, were negative for BDE production. Criteria for the confirmation of Bacillus-mediated diarrhoea should now include reports of symptoms and incubation periods consistent with the diarrhoeal form of food-poisoning by Bacillus spp., together with the results of tests for enterotoxigenicity of the Bacillus isolate, and detection of BDE in either the food and/or faeces.
TI  - Three Bacillus cereus bacteriophage endolysins are unrelated but reveal high homology to cell wall hydrolases from different bacilli.
AB  - The ply genes encoding the endolysin proteins from Bacillus cereus phages Bastille, TP21, and 12826 were identified, cloned, and sequenced. The endolysins could be overproduced in Escherichia coli (up to 20% of total cellular protein), and the recombinant proteins were purified by a two-step chromatographical procedure. All three enzymes induced rapid and specific lysis of viable cells of several Bacillus species, with highest activity on B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. Ply12 and Ply21 were experimentally shown to be N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases (EC 3.5.1.28). No apparent holin genes were found adjacent to the ply genes. However, Ply21 may be endowed with a signal peptide which could play a role in timing of cell lysis by the cytoplasmic phage endolysin. The individual lytic enzymes (PlyBa, 41.1 kDa; Ply21, 29.5 kDa, Ply12, 27.7 kDa) show remarkable heterogeneity, i.e., their amino acid sequences reveal only little homology. The N-terminal part of Ply21 was found to be almost identical to the catalytic domains of a Bacillus sp. cell wall hydrolase (CwlSP) and an autolysin of B. subtilis (CwlA). The C terminus of PlyBa contains a 77-amino-acid sequence repeat which is also homologous to the binding domain of CwlSP. Ply12 shows homology to the major autolysins from B. subtilis and E. coli. Comparison with database sequences indicated a modular organization of the phage lysis proteins where the enzymatic activity is located in the N-terminal region and the C-termini are responsible for specific recognition and binding of Bacillus peptidoglycan. We speculate that the close relationship of the phage enzymes and cell wall autolysins is based upon horizontal gene transfer among different Bacillus phages and their hosts.
TI  - Altering substrate specificity of Bacillus sp. SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase by comparative site-specific mutagenesis.
AB  - The Bacillus sp. SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase with a broad substrate specificity is  the only known alpha-glucosidase that can hydrolyze alpha,alpha'-trehalose efficiently. The enzyme exhibits a very high sequence similarity to the oligo-1,6-glucosidases (O16G) of Bacillus thermoglucosidasius and Bacillus cereus which cannot act on trehalose. These three enzymes share 80% identical residues within the conserved regions (CR), which have been suggested to be located near or at the active site of the alpha-amylase family enzymes. To identify by site-specific mutagenesis the critical residues that determine the broad substrate specificity of the SAM1606 enzyme we compared the CR sequences of these three glucosidases and selected five targets to be mutagenized in SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase, Met76, Arg81, Ala116, Gly273, and Thr342. These residues have been specifically replaced by in vitro mutagenesis with Asn, Ser, Val, Pro, and Asn, respectively, as in the Bacillus O16G. The 12 mutant enzymes with single and multiple substitutions were expressed and characterized kinetically. The results showed that the 5-fold mutation virtually abolished the affinity of the enzyme for alpha, alpha'-trehalose, whereas the specificity constant for the hydrolysis of isomaltose, a good substrate for both the SAM1606 enzyme and O16G, remained essentially unchanged upon the mutation. This loss in affinity for trehalose was critically governed by a Gly273 --> Pro substitution, whose effect was specifically enhanced by the Thr342 --> Asn substitution in the 5-fold and quadruple mutants. These results provide evidence for the differential roles of the amino acid residues in the CR in determining the substrate specificity of the alpha-glucosidase.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Selective killing of human monocytes and cytokine release provoked by sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin) of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The best-known activity of Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C, alias beta-toxin, is as a hemolysin that provokes hot-cold lysis of erythrocytes which contain substantial amounts of sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. Sheep erythrocytes are most susceptible, and we found that one hemolytic unit, representing the toxin concentration that elicits 50% hemolysis of 2.5 X 10(8) erythrocytes per ml, corresponds to 0.05 enzyme units or to approximately 0.25 microg of sphingomyelinase per ml. The cytotoxic action of beta-toxin on nucleated cells has not been described in any detail before, and the present investigation was undertaken to fill this information gap. We now identify beta-toxin as a remarkably potent monocytocidal agent. At a concentration of 0.001 U/ml, corresponding to approximately 5 ng/ml, beta-toxin killed over 50% of human monocytes (10(6) cells per ml) within 60 min. By contrast, 1 to 5 microg of beta-toxin per ml had no cytocidal effects on human granulocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or erythrocytes. A selective monocytocidal action was also observed with sphingomyelinase C from Bacillus cereus and a Streptomyces sp., whereas phospholipase A2 and phospholipase D at 100 U/ml were without effect. Monocytes succumbing to the action of beta-toxin processed and released interleukin-1beta, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, and soluble CD14 into the supernatant. Thus, monocyte killing by beta-toxin is associated with cytokine-related events that are important for the initiation and progression of infectious disease. These findings uncover a potentially important role for sphingomyelinase as a determinant of microbial pathogenicity.
TI  - Screening and characterization of microorganisms with glutaryl-7ADCA acylase activity.
AB  - A screening of microorganisms producing glutaryl-7ADCA acylase, an enzyme able to hydrolyse glutaric acid selectively from glutaryl-3-deacetoxy-7-aminocephalosporanic acid (glutaryl-7ADCA), has been carried out in soil samples. Five microorganisms expressing acylase activity were isolated and classified as Bacillus cereus, Achromobacter xylosooxidans, Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas paucimobilis. The screening was carried out by preparing enrichment cultures containing glutaryl-7-ADCA or cephalosporin C as the selective carbon source. Four model compounds (adipoyl-, glutamyl- and glutaryl-p-nitroanilide and glutarylcoumarin), mimicking the glutaryl-7ADCA beta-lactam moiety, were synthesized as substrates suitable for the rapid screening of the microorganisms (2500) isolated from the enrichment cultures. A total of 300 strains were active on the model substrates and only 5 displayed acylase activity on glutaryl-7ADCA. The fermentation parameters, such as pH and inducer concentration, for the optimal acylase expression and acylase specificity towards the model substrates were different for each strain.
TI  - Effects of three microbial probiotics on postprandial porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose, galactose and amino-nitrogen in the young pig.
AB  - Postprandial kinetics of porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose (G), galactose (Gal), L-lactic acid (LA) and amino-N (AN) were studied in the piglet after the ingestion of 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) Sporolactobacillus P44 (SP), or 10(6) cfu Bacillus cereus IP5832 (AC), or 10(6) cfu of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis (AB)/g feed. Sixteen fistulated piglets (portal vein and brachiocephalic trunk; mean body weight 22 (SD 2) kg) were used. The diet was based on skimmed milk (320 g/kg), barley (300 g/kg), wheat bran (110 g/kg), maize (100 g/kg) and lactose (70 g/kg). The postprandial blood kinetics, four measurements per animal at 1-week intervals, were studied for 6 h after the ingestion of test meals of 400 g basal diet (BD) or this diet supplemented with the bacteria (SP, AC and AB respectively). Areas of porto-arterial concentration differences (APACD) of G, Gal and LA were not influenced by the bacteria supplements. APACD of AN was significantly higher after the ingestion of the SP diet than that estimated for BD.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Glycan requirements of glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C from Trypanosoma brucei. Glucosaminylinositol derivatives inhibit phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C.
AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from Trypanosoma brucei and phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus sp. both cleave glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs). However, phosphatidylinositol, which is efficiently cleaved by PI-PLC, is a very poor substrate for GPI-PLC. We examined GPI-PLC substrate requirements using glycoinositol analogs of GPI components as potential inhibitors. Glucosaminyl (alpha 1-->6)-D-myo-inositol (GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins), GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate, GlcN(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-Ins, and GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate inhibited GPI-PLC. GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins was as effective as Man-(alpha 1-->4)GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins; we surmise that GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins is the crucial glycan motif for GPI-PLC recognition. Inhibition by GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate suggests product inhibition since GPIs cleaved by GPI-PLC possess a GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate at the terminus of the residual glycan. The effectiveness of GlcN(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-Ins indicates that the D-myo-inositol (Ins) 2-hydroxyl is not required for substrate recognition, although it is probably essential for catalysis. GlcN(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-L-myo-inositol, unlike GlcN(alpha 1-->6)-2- deoxy-Ins, had no effect on GPI-PLC; hence, GPI-PLC can distinguish between the two enantiomers of Ins. Surprisingly, GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate was not a potent inhibitor of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC, and GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins had no effect on the enzyme. However, both GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins 1-phosphate and GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate were competitive inhibitors of PI-PLC. These observations suggest an important role for a phosphoryl group at the Ins 1-position in PI-PLC recognition of GPIs. Other studies indicate that abstraction of a proton from the Ins 2-hydroxyl is not an early event in PI-PLC cleavage of GPIs. Furthermore, both GlcN(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-Ins 1-phosphate and GlcN(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-L- myo-inositol inhibited PI-PLC without affecting GPI-PLC. Last, the aminoglycoside G418 stimulated PI-PLC, but had no effect on GPI-PLC. Thus, these enzymes represent mechanistic subclasses of GPI phospholipases C, distinguishable by their sensitivity to GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins derivatives and aminoglycosides. Possible allosteric regulation of PI-PLC by GlcN(alpha 1-->6)Ins analogs is discussed.
TI  - Survival and growth of selected pathogens in fermented kocho (Ensete ventricosum).
AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the antagonistic potential of fermented kocho, aqueous extract of fermented kocho and spent media from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from it on Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Fermented kocho (pH 4.3) inhibited growth of the test bacteria soon after their introduction into the food. The spent media from all of the four LAB, isolated from fermented kocho, namely Pediococcus sp, Leuconostoc sp, Lactobacillus sp and Streptococcus sp prevented the survival and growth of the test bacteria. The spent medium from Streptococcus sp showed the best antagonistic effect amongst all the LAB isolates. In all cases the inhibitory effects were independent of pH.
TI  - Responses of diverse heterotrophic bacteria to elevated copper concentrations.
AB  - The influence of copper on the growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus (three strains), and an unidentified Vibrio sp. was examined in batch cultures. The effects of copper at micromolar concentrations varied from undetectable to complete growth inhibition. Each strain was able to recover from a growth lag observed after copper addition at a characteristic concentration. Copper concentrations that allowed recovery ranged from 25 to 150 microM. Extracellular proteins in the medium of cultures that had recovered from copper stress were compared with those from control cultures. Protein profiles were analyzed for the presence of proteins similar to extracellular copper-binding proteins (CuBP) previously reported in V. alginolyticus. CuBP-like proteins were found in each Vibrio sp. examined. A protein of similar molecular mass was also detected in copper-stressed cultures of P. aeruginosa and not in control cultures. Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp. did not produce CuBP-like proteins. The data show that CuBP-like proteins are not produced by all bacteria in response to copper stress and indicate that such proteins are common in marine Vibrio spp.
TI  - Structure and expression of a gene coding for thermostable alpha-glucosidase with a broad substrate specificity from Bacillus sp. SAM1606.
AB  - We cloned an alpha-glucosidase gene from thermophilic Bacillus sp. SAM1606 to overexpress it in Escherichia coli transformants. Deletion of the 5'-noncoding region as well as expression of the alpha-glucosidase gene under the control of the icp promotor of the insecticidal crystal protein gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. sotto enhanced the enzyme productivity to 23.5 U/ml, which was 12,000-fold higher than that obtained by the strain SAM1606. The open reading frame corresponding to the alpha-glucosidase encoded 587 amino acid residues including a residue coded by the initiation codon TTG, and the molecular mass of the alpha-glucosidase from N-terminal serine was calculated to be 68,886 Da. Sequence analysis revealed that the SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase belonged to the alpha-amylase family. The SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase showed extremely high sequence identity (62-65%) to the Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thermoglucosidasius oligo-1,6-glucosidases, which were 72% identical to each other. Sequence identity in the suggested active site regions were essentially the same (80-82%) among these three enzymes. However, the substrate specificity of the SAM1606 alpha-glucosidase was significantly different from those of the oligo-1,6-glucosidases. The thermostability of these three alpha-glucosidases could be correlated with the increase in the number of proline residues, whose occurrence was predicted at beta turns and coils in the enzymes.
TI  - Seasonal occurrence of psychrotrophic Bacillus species in raw milk, and studies on the interactions with mesophilic Bacillus sp.
AB  - Mesophilic and psychrotrophic isolates of Bacillus species displayed seasonal incidences in raw and pasteurised milk. The incidence of mesophilic isolates was highest in the winter and lowest in the summer/autumn while pschrotroph incidence was conversely lowest in the winter and highest in the late summer/autumn. Spores of Bacillus sp. were isolated from raw milk taken from farm milk machines and bulk tanks, milk tankers, diary silos and pasteurised milk. A consistent seasonal fluctuation in incidence throughout these samples suggested that spores of Bacillus sp. derived from the farm environment survived as important contaminants right through the milk chain to the pasteurised product. Up to seven mesophilic Bacillus sp. were isolated from a single sample with three species commonly occurring in most samples. The predominant mesophilic species isolated were B. pumilus, B. licheniformis and B. subtilis. The dominant psychrotrophic isolate was B. cereus. Selected mesophilic isolates were examined for possible antagonistic effects on the growth of psychrotropic B. cereus and B. pumilus isolates. Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis were found to produce antagonistic factors. It was considered that these factors may influence the incidence and growth of psychrotrophic isolates in the farm environment or in milk but the factors are not yet fully characterised or identified.
TI  - Phospholipids chiral at phosphorus. Stereochemical mechanism for the formation of inositol 1-phosphate catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.
AB  - The phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from mammalian sources catalyzes the simultaneous formation of both inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate (IcP) and inositol 1-phosphate (IP). It has not been established whether the two products are formed in sequential or parallel reactions, even though the latter has been favored in previous reports. This problem was investigated by using a stereochemical approach. Diastereomers of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-(1D- [16O,17O]phosphoinositol) ([16O,17O]DPPI) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-(1D-thiophosphoinositol) (DPPsI) were synthesized, the latter with known configuration. Desulfurization of the DPPsI isomers of known configurations in H2(18)O gave [16O,18O]DPPI with known configurations, which allowed assignment of the configurations of [16O,17O]DPPI on the basis of 31P NMR analyses of silylated [16O,18O]DPPI and [16O,17O]DPPI (the inositol moiety was fully protected in this operation). (Rp)- and (Sp)-[16O,17O]DPPI were then converted into trans- and cis-[16O,17O]IcP, respectively, by PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus, which had been shown to proceed with inversion of configuration at phosphorus [Lin, G., Bennett, F. C., & Tsai, M.-D. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 2747-2757]. 31P NMR analysis was again used to differentiate the silylated products of the two isomers of IcP, which then permitted assignments of IcP with unknown configuration derived from transesterification of (Rp)- and (Sp)-[16O,17O]DPPI by bovine brain PI-PLC-beta 1. The results indicated inversion of configuration, in agreement with the steric course of the same reaction catalyzed by PI-PLCs from B. cereus and guinea pig uterus reported previously. For the steric course of the formation of inositol 1-phosphate catalyzed by PI-PLC, (Rp)- and (Sp)-[16O,17O]DPPI were hydrolyzed in H2(18)O to afford 1-[16O,17O,18O]IP, which was then converted to IcP chemically and analyzed by 31P NMR. The results indicated that both B. cereus PI-PLC and the PI-PLC-beta 1 from bovine brain catalyze conversion of DPPI to IP with overall retention of configuration at phosphorus. These results suggest that both bacterial and mammalian PI-PLCs catalyze the formation of IcP and IP by a sequential mechanism. However, the conversion of IcP to IP was detectable by 31P NMR only for the bacterial enzyme. Thus an alternative mechanism in which IcP and IP are formed by totally independent pathways, with formation of IP involving a covalent enzyme-phosphoinositol intermediate, cannot be ruled out for the mammalian enzyme. It was also found that both PI-PLCs displayed lack of stereo-specifically toward the 1,2-diacylglycerol moiety, which suggests that the hydrophobic part of phosphatidylinositol is not recognized by PI-PLC.
TI  - Improved methods for purification of an enterotoxin produced by Bacillus cereus.
AB  - An enterotoxin (ET) produced by Bacillus cereus was purified by ammonium sulfate  precipitation followed by chromatography on SP-Sephadex C-25, chromatofocusing, and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. Purified ET was electrophoretically homogeneous with a molecular mass of 45,000 and with an isoelectric point of 5.5. It showed vascular permeability activity in rabbits, was lethal to mice, and caused fluid accumulation in mouse ligated intestinal loops. It showed cytotoxicity to Vero cells, but did not show any hemolytic or phospholipase C activities. These biological activities were found to be easily inactivated by heating at 56 degrees C for 5 min, by digestion with trypsin and pepsin, and by exposure to pH below 3.0 or higher than 11.
TI  - Phospholipids chiral at phosphorus. Stereochemical mechanism of reactions catalyzed by phosphatidylinositide-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus and guinea pig uterus.
AB  - (Rp)- and (Sp)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphoinositol (DPPsI) were synthesized as a mixture and their configurations assigned on the basis of the stereospecific hydrolysis catalyzed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from bee venom. PLA2 is known to be stereospecific to the Rp isomer of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphocholine (DPPsC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphoethanolamine (DPPsE). Since the configurations of (Rp)- and (Sp)-DPPsI correspond to those of (Sp)- and (Rp)-DPPsC, respectively, due to a change in priority, the isomer specifically hydrolyzed by PLA2 was assigned to (Sp)-DPPsI. The DPPsI analogues were then used to probe the mechanism and to elucidate the steric course of the reaction catalyzed by phosphatidylinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus and for both isozyme I and isozyme II of PI-PLC from guinea pig uterus. It was found that the Rp isomer of DPPsI is the preferred substrate for all three PI-PLCs. Thus PI-PLC shows the same stereospecificity as phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (PC-PLC), which prefers the Sp isomer of DPPsC. The ratio of the two products inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphorothioate (cIPs) and inositol phosphorothioate (IPs) was not significantly perturbed by the use of phosphorothioate analogue for all three PI-PLCs, which implies that IPs is not produced by enzyme-mediated ring opening of cIPs and supports a parallel pathway for the formation of both products. In order to elucidate the steric course of the cyclization reaction, exo and endo isomers of cIPs were synthesized and their absolute configurations at phosphorus were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and other techniques. It was found that exo-cIPs is the product produced by all three PI-PLCs. Thus the steric course of the conversion DPPsI to cIPs catalyzed by all three PI-PLCs was inversion of configuration at phosphorus. These results taken together suggest that the reaction catalyzed by PI-PLC most likely proceeds via direct attack by the 2-OH group to generate the cyclic product, and parallelly by water to generate the noncyclic inositol phosphates, without involving a covalent enzyme-phosphoinositol intermediate.
TI  - Biological Control of Damping-Off of Alfalfa Seedlings with Bacillus cereus UW85.
AB  - We explored the potential of biological control of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seedling damping-off caused by Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. medicaginis by screening root-associated bacteria for disease suppression activity in a laboratory bioassay. A total of 700 bacterial strains were isolated from the roots of field-grown alfalfa plants by using Trypticase soy agar. A simple, rapid assay was developed to screen the bacteria for the ability to reduce the mortality of Iroquois alfalfa seedlings that were inoculated with P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis zoospores. Two-day-old seedlings were planted in culture tubes containing moist vermiculite, and each tube was inoculated with a different bacterial culture. Sufficient P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis zoospores were added to each tube to result in 100% mortality of control seedlings. Of the 700 bacterial isolates tested, only 1, which was identified as Bacillus cereus and designated UW85, reduced seedling mortality to 0% in the initial screen and in two secondary screens. Both fully sporulated cultures containing predominantly released spores and sterile filtrates of these cultures of UW85 were effective in protecting seedlings from damping-off; filtrates of cultures containing predominantly vegetative cells or endospores inside the parent cell had low biocontrol activity. Cultures grown in two semidefined media had significantly greater biocontrol activities than cultures grown in the complex tryptic soy medium. In a small-scale trial in a field infested with P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis, coating seeds with UW85 significantly increased the emergence of alfalfa. The results suggest that UW85 may have potential as a biocontrol agent for alfalfa damping-off, thus providing an alternative to current disease control strategies.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - Screening of isoquinoline alkaloids and their derivatives for antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A screening test of antimicrobial activities for some of the isoquinoline alkaloids and their first and second Hofmann elimination products was conducted in this study. Results showed that (+)-actinodaphnine (1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), (-)-xylopine (19) and (-)-N-Me-xylopine MeI (20), had the strongest inhibitory activities against three G(+) bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus) MIC greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). Whereas anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), dicentrine methine (23), roemerine methine (26), dicentrine bismethine (29) and O-Me-armepavine methine (48) also had antibacterial effects against these same three G(+) bacteria (MIC = 50-300 micrograms/ml). However, only (+)-actinodaphnine (1) and roemerine methine (26) showed weak effects against two G(-) bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) (MIC = 300 micrograms/ml). (+)-Actinodaphnine(1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), O-Me-armepavine methine (48) and O,O-di-Et-N-Me-coclaurine methine (49) had potent antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and other Candida species (MIC = 62.5-1000 micrograms/ml).
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of the lipo-penicillinase gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170.
AB  - The lipo-penicillinase (LIPEN) gene from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170  was cloned in Escherichia coli using the vector pHSG399. A plasmid, pFAP121, was isolated from an ampicillin resistant transformant and the cloned LIPEN gene was found to be in a 2.2 kb DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of a 1.9 kb segment encoding the LIPEN was determined. This segment showed an open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide of 310 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of this LIPEN gene product has strong homology with those of the Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase III and Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase.
TI  - Microbial transformation of the pyrethroid insecticides: permethrin, deltamethrin, fastac, fenvalerate, and fluvalinate.
AB  - Pure cultures of Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Achromobacter sp.  were shown to transform five pyrethroid insecticides in the presence of Tween 80. One of the major products, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, was further transformed to 4-hydroxy-3-phenoxybenzoic acid. Permethrin was the most rapidly transformed of the pyrethroids, with a half-life of less than 5 days.
TI  - The biosynthetic implications of acetate and glutamate incorporation into (3R,5R)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid and (5R)-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid by Serratia sp.
AB  - Two new beta-lactams have been isolated from strains of Serratia and Erwinia sp.  and identified as (3R,5R)- and (3S,5R)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid. These novel carbapenams lack antibacterial activity, are resistant to both beta-lactamases I and II from Bacillus cereus and are not detected by the lactamase induction assay. Radiolabelled and stable isotope experiments have established that both metabolites together with the antibiotic 5R-carbapenem-3-carboxylic acid are glutamate and acetate derived. A number of possible pathways for the biosynthesis of these compounds as well as their relationship to the more complex members of the carbapenem family of beta-lactam antibiotics are discussed.
TI  - Surface-active agents from two bacillus species.
AB  - Two Bacillus species were studied which produced bioemulsifiers; however, they were distinctly different compounds. Bacillus sp. strain IAF 343 produced unusually high yields of extracellular biosurfactant when grown on a medium containing only water-soluble substrates. The yield of 1 g/liter was appreciably better than those of most of the biosurfactants reported previously. This neutral lipid product, unlike most lipid biosurfactants, had significant emulsifying properties. It did not appreciably lower the surface tension of water. On the same medium, Bacillus cereus IAF 346 produced a more conventional polysaccharide bioemulsifier, but it also produced a monoglyceride biosurfactant. The bioemulsifier contained substantial amounts of glucosamine and originated as part of the capsule layer. The monoglyceride lowered the surface tension of water to 28 mN/m. It formed a strong association with the polysaccharide, and it was necessary to use ultrafiltration to effect complete separation. The removal of the monoglyceride caused the polysaccharide to precipitate. It is suggested that earlier reports of biopolymers which both stabilized emulsions and lowered surface tension were actually similar aggregates of lipid and bioemulsifier.
TI  - Plaster-associated Bacillus cereus wound infection. A case report.
AB  - Plaster of Paris and nonsterile cast padding have previously been implicated in wound infections. The observation of three pin site infections with Bacillus cereus following pin placement and plaster fixation of an open forearm fracture led to an epidemiologic investigation. Two hundred sixty-one bacterial cultures were taken from materials in the Steinmann pin application and plaster fixation procedures. B. cereus with a similar antibiogram and biotype as was identified in the pin site cultures was recovered from three of the 22 (14%) plaster-impregnated gauze rolls and six of seven (81%) tapwater samples. The Bacillus sp contamination rate of plaster when dry or wetted with sterile water or tapwater was 58%, 25% and 40% respectively. All cultures of plaster samples were negative after steam or gas sterilization. These results suggest that the patient may have acquired the infection from the plaster-impregnated gauze wetted in tapwater. In this case, the Steinmann pins may have facilitated infection by guiding the plaster-associated bacteria to the pin insertion site. The use of gas sterilized plaster materials should be considered in certain circumstances.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the beta-lactamase gene of alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170.
AB  - A gene for the beta-lactamase from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 170 was cloned in a functional state on a 1.0 kb DNA fragment and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The coding sequence showed an open reading frame of 257 amino acids, which represents the beta-lactamase precursor protein. It is considered that the signal peptide consisted of 30 amino acids including 12 hydrophobic amino acids.
TI  - [Biochemical characterization of Bacillus benzoevorans sp. nov., a new filamentous, sheathed mesophilic species, degrading various aromatic acids and phenols].
AB  - The eleven strains studied were prototrophic and did not grow in media containing only 1% Bacto-peptone or Bacto-tryptone; they grew rapidly in media containing 0.4% yeast extract and 0.2% sodium acetate or benzoate. The maximal growth temperature ranged from 39 to 45 degrees C. Six aliphatic acids, four aromatic acids and five phenols were used as sole carbon and energy sources by the 11 strains. Carbohydrates and amino acids (except for glycine) were not used as carbon and energy sources. Nitrate (but not nitrite) was used anaerobically as a respiratory electron acceptor. Nitrous oxide was used and reduced to N2 by only 3 strains. The mean guanine-plus-cytosine content of the DNA was 41.3 +/- 1.1 mol %. Morphologically and nutritionally, the bacteria described are clearly different from the 5 known species of the first morphological group whose cells have a diameter greater than 1 micrometer: Bacillus megaterium, B. cereus, B. cereus var. mycoides, B. macroides, B. badius, and B. fastidiosus. Strain B1 (=CCM 3364) is the holotype of Bacillus benzoevorans sp. nov.
TI  - [Spoilage microorganisms encountered in ultra-high temperature processed milk].
AB  - 40 strains of aerobic or facultative anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from  a total of 37 spoiled ultra high temperature processed milk. 13 of them were identified as the genus Bacillus. They were 6 B. cereus, 5 B. licheniformis, 1 B. brevis and 1 B. pumilus. The other 27 strains were nonsporeforming microorganisms, which included 5 yeasts, 2 Pseudomonas sp., 3 Streptococcus sp., 12 Lactobacillus sp., 1 Shigella sp., 1 Aeromonas sp. and 3 Micrococcus sp. Results indicate that the spoilage of milk sample was caused mainly by the contamination during the filling operation. The Bacillus strains isolated were mesophilic or thermophilic, and some of them, were also psychrotrophic.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - Influence of Environmental Factors on Antagonism of Fungi by Bacteria in Soil: Clay Minerals and pH.
AB  - The soil replica plating technique was used to evaluate the influence of clay minerals and pH on antagonistic interactions between fungi and bacteria in soil. In general, the antagonistic activity of bacteria towards filamentous fungi was greater in soil than on agar. The spread of Aspergillus niger through soil was inhibited by Serratia marcescens when the organisms were inoculated into separate sites in soil, and this antagonistic effect was maintained when the soil was amended with 3, 6, 9, or 12% (vol/vol) montmorillonite, whereas the addition of kaolinite at a concentration of 3% reduced the antagonism and at 6, 9, or 12% totally eliminated it. Similar results were obtained with the inhibition of A. niger by Agrobacterium radiobacter and of Penicillium vermiculatum by either S. marcescens or Nocardia paraffinae. When A. niger and S. marcescens were inoculated into the same soil site, A. niger was inhibited in all soils, regardless of clay content, although the extent of inhibition was greater as the concentration of montmorillonite, but not of kaolinite, increased. A. niger was inhibited more when inoculated as spores than as mycelial fragments and when inoculated 96 h after S. marcescens, but a 1% glucose solution reduced the amount of inhibition when the fungus was inoculated 96 h after the bacterium. When the pH of the soil-clay mixtures was altered, the amount of antagonism usually increased as the pH increased. Antagonism appeared to be related to the cation-exchange capacity and the pH of the soil-clay mixtures. Bacillus cereus and another species of Bacillus showed no activity in soil towards A. niger under any of the environmental conditions tested, even though the Bacillus sp. significantly inhibited A. niger and seven other fungi on agar.
TI  - Continuous Cultivation for Apparent Optimization of Defined Media for Cellulomonas sp. and Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Steady-state continuous culture was used to optimize lean chemically defined media for a Cellulomonas sp. and Bacillus cereus strain T. Both organisms were extremely sensitive to variations in trace-metal concentrations. However, medium optimization by this technique proved rapid, and multifactor screening was easily conducted by using a minimum of instrumentation. The optimized media supported critical dilution rates of 0.571 and 0.467 h for Cellulomonas and Bacillus, respectively. These values approximated maximum growth rate values observed in batch culture.
TI  - Serious infections from Bacillus sp.
AB  - Serious infections caused by organisms of the genus Bacillus developed in seven patients. Five drug abusers had either endocarditis or osteomyelitis, one leukemic patient had necrotizing fasciitis, and one patient had a ventriculoatrial shunt infection with recurrent bacteremia. All patients recovered. Experience with these cases reemphasizes the importance of not dismissing Bacillus organisms as culture contaminants, especially when isolated from blood, body fluids, or closed-space infections.
TI  - Production of L-glutamic acid by a Bacillus sp.
AB  - A strain of Bacillus cereus var. mycoides isolated from Burdwan soil produces L-glutamate in the medium. The strain is able to grow and produce in a synthetic medium but supplementation with casamino acid or yeast extract improves the yield. Maintenance of pH of the fermentation medium near neutrality prolongs the active growth period and improves the yield. Glucose and ammonium nitrate were found to be most suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Cane sugar molasses (as a substitute for glucose) significantly stimulated the growth but glutamate production was less. Various B vitamins stimulate the growth and glutamate yield. The yield of glutamate under optimal condition is 5.2 g/l.
TI  - Microbiological transformations of delta6a10a-tetrahydrocannabinol.
AB  - A screening program was conducted to find microorganisms that catalyze transformation reactions with cannabinoids. Three hundred fifty-eight cultures, consisting of 97 bacteria, 175 actinomycetes, and 86 molds, were incubated in media containing 0.5 mg of Delta(6a,10a)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(6a,10a)-THC) per ml. After 120 h of cultivation, ethyl acetate extracts of the cultures were examined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for transformation products. About 18% of the cultures modified Delta(6a,10a)-THC. The ability to modify the substrate did not predominate among any particular group of microorganisms. After purification, the products from three cultures were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, 100-mHz proton magnetic resonance spectrometry, ultraviolet spectrometry, and infrared spectrometry. These spectral data indicated that a Mycobacterium sp. oxidized Delta(6a,10a)-THC to cannabinol and a diastereomeric pair of 6a-hydroxy-Delta(10,10a)-THC isomers; a Streptomyces sp. and a Bacillus sp. oxidized Delta(6a,10a)-THC to 7-keto-Delta(6a,10a)-THC and 4'-hydroxy-Delta(6a,10a)-THC, respectively. The occurrence of these products and the presence of others that have not yet been isolated or identified indicate that microbial transformation may be a useful tool for the preparation of new cannabinoids that have desirable pharmacological properties.
TI  - Effect of cadmium on fungi and on interactions between fungi and bacteria in soil: influence of clay minerals and pH.
AB  - Fungi (Rhizopus stolonifer, Trichoderma viride, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans, Cunninghamella echinulata, and several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium) tolerated higher concentrations of cadmium (Cd) when grown in soil than when grown on laboratory media, indicating that soil mitigated the toxic effects of Cd. In soil amended with clay minerals, montmorillonite provided partial or total protection against fungistatic effects of Cd, whereas additions of kaolinite provided little or no protection. Growth rates of Aspergillus niger were inhibited to a greater extent by 100 or 250 mug of Cd per g in soil adjusted to pH 7.2 than in the same soil at its natural pH of 5.1. However, there were no differences in the growth rates of Aspergillus fischeri with 100 or 250 mug of Cd per g in the same soil, whether at pH 5.1 or adjusted to pH 7.2. Growth of A. niger and A. fischeri in a soil contaminated with a low concentration of Cd (i.e., 28 mug/g), obtained from a site near a Japanese smelter, did not differ significantly from growth in a soil collected some distance away and containing 4 mug of Cd per g. Growth of A. niger in sterile soil amended with 100 mug of Cd per g and inoculated with Bacillus cereus or Agrobacterium tumefaciens was reduced to a greater extent than in the same soil containing 100 mug of Cd per g but no bacteria. The inhibitory effects of Agrobacterium radiobacter to A. niger were slightly reduced in the presence of 100 mug of Cd per g, whereas the inhibitory effects of Serratia marcescens were enhanced.
TI  - Facultative wood-digesting bacteria from the hind-gut of the termite Reticulitermes hesperus.
AB  - Among the facultative bacteria capable of growth on mesquite wood which were isolated from the asceptically dissected hind-gut of the termite Reticulitermes hesperus were two strains of Bacillus cereus, one strain each of Arthrobacter, Alcaligenes and Serratia, and a very small Gram-negative fermentative rod. The B. cereus strains, the Serratia marcescens strain and the Arthrobacter sp. grew well on a mineral salts alpha-cellusose agar. One of the Bacillus cereus strains and Serratia marcescens hydrolysed gels of carboxymethylcellulose. All isolates grew well with mesquite wood as the carbon source. The Serratia marcescens isolate produced prodigiosin but differed from a typed strain both in size and in some physiological characteristics.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of cerexin A (studies on antibiotics from the genus Bacillus. VII.
AB  - N-Bromosuccinimide cleavage reaction on cerexin A liberated allo-isoleucine. Treatment with conc. hydrochloric acid cleaved the antibiotic into two peptide fragments selectively at gamma-hydroxylysine residue. Deacylation with an enzyme preparation from Pseudomonas sp. afforded deacyl cerexin A. The amino acid sequences of these peptide fragments were examined by Edman degradation. From all the results, the entire amino acid sequence of cerexin A was deduced.

AB  - Two food bacteria, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas sp. CS-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
