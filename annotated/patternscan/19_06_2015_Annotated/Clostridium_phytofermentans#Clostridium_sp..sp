TI  == functional expression of a bacterial xylose isomerase in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  == in industrial fermentation processes, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used for ethanol production. however, it lacks the ability to ferment pentose sugars like d-xylose and l-arabinose. heterologous expression of a xylose isomerase (xi) would enable yeast cells to metabolize xylose. however, many attempts to express a prokaryotic xi with high activity in s. cerevisiae have failed so far. we have screened nucleic acid databases for sequences encoding putative xis and finally were able to clone and successfully express a highly active new kind of xi from the anaerobic bacterium clostridium phytofermentans in s. cerevisiae. heterologous expression of this enzyme confers on the yeast cells  the ability to metabolize d-xylose and to use it as the sole carbon and energy source. the new enzyme has low sequence similarities to the xis from piromyces sp. strain e2 and thermus thermophilus, which were the only two xis previously functionally expressed in s. cerevisiae. the activity and kinetic parameters of the new enzyme are comparable to those of the piromyces xi. importantly, the new  enzyme is far less inhibited by xylitol, which accrues as a side product during xylose fermentation. furthermore, expression of the gene could be improved by adapting its codon usage to that of the highly expressed glycolytic genes of s. cerevisiae. expression of the bacterial xi in an industrially employed yeast strain enabled it to grow on xylose and to ferment xylose to ethanol. thus, our findings provide an excellent starting point for further improvement of xylose fermentation in industrial yeast strains.

TI  == clostridium phytofermentans sp. nov., a cellulolytic mesophile from forest soil.
AB  == an obligately anaerobic, mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterium, strain isdgt, was isolated from forest soil. cells of this isolate stained gram-negative, despite possessing a gram-positive cell-wall ultrastructure, and were motile, straight rods that formed spherical terminal spores that swelled the sporangium. cellulose, pectin, polygalacturonic acid, starch, xylan, arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, galactose, gentiobiose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannose, ribose and  xylose supported growth. the major end products of fermentation were ethanol, acetate, co2 and h2; formate and lactate were minor products. the optimum temperature for growth was 35-37 degrees c. phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna sequence comparisons showed that strain isdgt was related to a group of anaerobes that included clostridium herbivorans, clostridium polysaccharolyticum  and clostridium populeti. the g+c content of this strain was 35.9 mol%. on the basis of numerous genotypic and phenotypic differences between strain isdgt and its close relatives, strain isdgt is proposed as a novel species in the genus clostridium, for which the name clostridium phytofermentans sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is isdgt (= atcc 700394t).
