TI  == probiotic attributes of lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human feces and dairy products.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize native lactobacillus fermentum isolates for their probiotic attributes. accordingly, 12 l. fermentum isolates selected from indigenous fermented dairy products and infant fecal samples were evaluated for their probiotic properties by in vitro and pcr methods. the cultures exhibited high tolerance to acid and bile as well as survival in simulated transit fluids (above 70 %). cell surface hydrophobicity was in the range of 0.55-57.69 % for xylene and 0.45-77.12 % for hexadecane, whereas auto-aggregation ranged between 9 and 62 %. isolates exhibited efficient binding  to mucin and fibronectin, bile salt hydrolase activity, cholesterol assimilation  (49-76 %), and radical scavenging activity (37-77 %). the isolates demonstrated antibacterial activity against listeria monocytogenes scott a and micrococcus luteus atcc 9341. molecular fingerprinting and identification of the isolates were achieved by pcr with gtg5 as well as 16s rrna, phenylalanyl-trna synthetase  alpha subunit (phes), and rna polymerase alpha subunit (rpoa) genes. this revealed the genomic diversity of the isolates from the two sources. gene-specific amplification of probiotic marker genes was attained by pcr-based methods, and resultant products were sequenced. multiple sequence alignment of the probiotic marker genes using bioinformatics revealed similarity to completely sequenced genomes of l. fermentum cect 5716 and ifo 3956 with a few variations in mucin-binding protein gene sequences. isolates designated as l. fermentum mcc 2759 and l. fermentum mcc 2760 showed the best probiotic attributes with high survival in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, in vitro adhesion, cholesterol reduction, and high antioxidative potential. thus, these cultures could be potential probiotic candidates for application as functional foods.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from canine faeces.
AB  == aims: lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated and sequenced from the faeces of healthy dogs. five of these strains were selected and further characterized to clarify the potential of these strains as probiotics for canine. methods and results: lab were found in 67% (14/21) of the canine faeces samples when plated on lactobacilli selective media without acetic acid. out of 13 species identified with partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, l. mucosae lab12, l. rhamnosus lab11, l. salivarius lab9 and weissella confusa lab10 were selected as candidate probiotic strains based on their frequency, quantity in faeces, growth density, acid tolerance and antimicrobial activity. the minimal inhibitory concentration values of these isolates were determined for 14 antibiotics. l. salivarius lab9, w. confusa lab10 and l. mucosae lab12 were viable in ph 2 for 4 h (mlbs), indicating tolerance to acidity and thus the potential to survive in gastrointestinal tract of the canine. the lab8-lab12 strains showed antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus a1 ncimb86166. conclusions: thirteen different lab species were found from the faecal microbiota of the healthy canines. five acid tolerant and antimicrobially active lab strains with the capacity to grow to high densities both aerobically and anaerobically were chosen to serve as candidate probiotics. significance and impact of the study: the selected lab strains are among the first host-specific lab with antimicrobial activity isolated from canines that could serve as potential probiotics for canine use.
