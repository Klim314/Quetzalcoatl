TI  - Enteric campylobacteria and RNA viruses associated with healthy and diarrheic humans in the Chinook health region of southwestern Alberta, Canada.
AB  - The presence of Campylobacter species and enteric RNA viruses in stools from diarrheic (n = 442) and healthy (n = 58) humans living in southwestern Alberta was examined (May to October 2005). A large number of diarrheic individuals who were culture negative for C. jejuni (n = 54) or C. coli (n = 19) were PCR positive for these taxa. Overall detection rates for C. jejuni and C. coli in diarrheic stools were 29% and 5%, respectively. In contrast, 3% and 0% of stools from healthy humans were positive for these taxa, respectively. Infection with C. jejuni was endemic over the study period. However, there was no difference in infection rates between individuals living in urban or rural locations. Stools from a large number of diarrheic (74%) and healthy (88%) individuals were positive for Campylobacter DNA. The prevalence rates of C. concisus, C. curvus, C. fetus, C. gracilis, C. helveticus, C. hominis, C. hyointestinalis, C. mucosalis, C. showae, C. sputorum, and C. upsaliensis DNA were either not significantly different or were significantly lower in stools from diarrheic than from healthy individuals. No C. lanienae or C. lari DNA was detected. Stools from 4% and 0% of diarrheic and healthy humans, respectively, were positive for rotavirus, sapovirus, or norovirus (GI/GII). Our results showed a high prevalence of diarrheic individuals living in southwestern Alberta who were infected by C. jejuni and, to a lesser extent, by C. coli. However, other Campylobacter species, norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus, and bovine enteric calicivirus were either inconsequential pathogens during the study period or are not pathogens at all.
TI  - Host attachment, invasion, and stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines by Campylobacter concisus and other non-Campylobacter jejuni Campylobacter species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Campylobacter concisus and other non-Campylobacter jejuni Campylobacter species have been implicated in the initiation of gastrointestinal diseases. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between these bacteria and the human intestinal epithelium and immune cells. METHODS: The ability of C. concisus, Campylobacter showae, Campylobacter hominis, and Bacteroides ureolyticus to invade epithelial cells was examined using scanning electron microscopy and gentamicin protection assays. Proinflammatory cytokines generated by epithelial and immune cells in response to these bacteria were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ussing Chamber, immunofluorescent stain, and Western blot were used to further elucidate the impact of C. concisus on intestinal barrier integrity and functions. RESULTS: Attachment of non-C. jejuni Campylobacter species to Caco-2 or HT-29 cells was mediated by flagellum-dependent and/or -independent processes. C. concisus was able to invade Caco-2 cells, generate a membrane-ruffling effect on the epithelial surface on entry, and damage epithelial barrier functions by preferential attachment to the cell-cell junctions. Proinflammatory cytokine profiles exhibited by epithelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages in response to C. concisus and other non-C. jejuni Campylobacter species were species and strain specific. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that C. concisus and other non-C. jejuni Campylobacter species may play a role in initiating gastrointestinal diseases.
TI  - 16S rRNA gene sequences of 'Candidatus Campylobacter hominis', a novel uncultivated species, are found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy humans.
AB  - Although some Campylobacter species are agents of gastroenteritis and periodontal disease in humans, little is known of the variety of campylobacters in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals. This paper provides evidence for the existence of a previously undescribed, uncultivated Campylobacter species that may be a commensal in the healthy human gut. Saliva and faeces from 20 healthy individuals were examined by PCR assays specific for nine species of campylobacter (C. sputorum, C. concisus, C. upsaliensis, C. helveticus, C. lari, C. fetus, C. hyointestinalis, C. jejuni and C. coli) and for the genus as a whole. Genus-specific amplicons were produced from 19 of 20 saliva samples and from 18 of 20 faecal samples. C. concisus species-specific amplicons were produced from 19 of 20 saliva samples and 3 of 20 faecal samples. The faecal samples were all PCR-negative for other Campylobacter species. Three unidentified 16S rRNA Campylobacter genus-specific amplicons of faecal origin were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these sequences were 99% similar, and clustered within the genus as a novel group which was termed HS (HS = healthy subject). A PCR primer pair specific for the HS group was designed from the sequence data and used to reexamine the original samples. Although it was not possible to culture the organism from faeces, specific PCR assay detected it in 10 of the 20 faecal samples, but not in any corresponding saliva samples. The authors propose that the source of the amplicons is a previously undescribed and so far uncultivated species, which they term 'Candidatus Campylobacter hominis'.
