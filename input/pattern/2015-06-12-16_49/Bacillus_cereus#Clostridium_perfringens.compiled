TI  - Development of intestinal microflora and occurrence of diarrhoea in sucking foals: effects of Bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almost all foals develop transient diarrhoea within the first weeks of life. Studies indicated different viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes, such as rotavirus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium are discussed. But little is known about the development of intestinal microflora in foals. The present study investigated whether the supplementation with Bacillus cereus var. toyoi would modify the developing intestinal microflora and consequently reduce diarrhoea in foals. From birth, the foals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo (10 mL isotonic NaCl, n = 8), low dosage (LD; 5 x 10(8) cfu B. cereus var. toyoi, n = 7) and high dosage (HD; 2 x 10(9) cfu B. cereus var. toyoi, n = 10). Treatment groups were supplemented orally once a day for 58 days. Faeces scoring and sampling were performed within the first 24 h after birth and on day 9, 16, 23, 30, 44, 58 of the foal's life and also on the first day of diarrhoea. Culture-plate methods were used to analyse the bacterial microflora. RESULTS: Eighty-eight per cent of the foals developed diarrhoea (placebo 7/8, LD 5/7, HD 10/10) during the first 58 days of life. Bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation had no effect on bacterial microflora. Clostridium perfringens and enterobacteria were equally prevalent in foals with diarrhoea and those who were not afflicted. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the supplementation of B. cereus var. toyoi had no effect on the occurrence of diarrhoea and health status in the foals.
TI  - Characterization of the spore-forming Bacillus cereus sensu lato group and Clostridium perfringens bacteria isolated from the Australian dairy farm environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Bacillus cereus sensu lato group and Clostridium perfringens are  spore-forming bacteria often associated with food spoilage and which can cause emetic and diarrheal syndromes in humans and ruminants. This study characterised the phenotypes and genotypes of 50 Bacillus cereus s. l. isolates and 26 Clostridium perfringens isolates from dairy farms environments in Victoria, Australia. RESULTS: Five of the seven B. cereus s. l. species were isolated, and analysis of the population diversity using Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) suggested that the populations are largely distinct to each farm. Enterotoxin production by representative isolates of each B. cereus s. l. species identified was typically found to be reduced in milk, compared with broth. Among the C. perfringens isolates, only two different toxin types were identified, type A and D. Bovine and ovine farms harbored only type A whereas both type A and D were found on two of the three caprine farms. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the B. cereus s. l. populations on the sampled farms exhibit a broad diversity in both species and genotypes. The risk of toxin-induced diarrheal illness through consumption of contaminated milk may be limited, in comparison with other food matrices. Type A strains of C. perfringens were the most abundant on dairy farms in Victoria, however type D may be of concern on caprine farms as it can cause enterotoxemia in goats.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  - The present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). Samples were screened for Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. Microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log CFU/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (P < 0.05), whereas the other FABs contained , 25 CFU/25 ml microorganisms. Unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7 to 14.1%) or pH (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. Despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and B. cereus (detected in all FABs) were present in some products. B. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (P < 0.05). The finding that spore-forming B. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality FAB products. New strategic quality management plans for various FABs are needed.
TI  - Expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in Canada.
AB  - Enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in Canada and globally. Understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. Expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously, to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information is difficult or expensive to obtain. Thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. The elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. Experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. Estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. Transmission was attributed primarily to food for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Trichinella spp., all three Vibrio spp. categories explored, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as Campylobacter spp., four Escherichia coli categories, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. Water was the primary pathway for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and Shigella spp. Consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. This study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for Canada, considering all possible transmission routes. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and E. coli subgroups in Canada.
TI  - Characterization of Deep Sea Fish Gut Bacteria with Antagonistic Potential, from  Centroscyllium fabricii (Deep Sea Shark).
AB  - The bacterial isolates from Centroscyllium fabricii (deep sea shark) gut were screened for antagonistic activity by cross-streak method and disc diffusion assay. This study focuses on strain BTSS-3, which showed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella Typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus macerans and Bacillus pumilus. BTSS3 was subjected to phenotypic characterization using biochemical tests, SEM imaging, exoenzyme profiling and antibiotic susceptibility tests. Comparative 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis indicated that this strain belonged to the genus Bacillus, with high (98 %) similarity to 16S rDNA sequences of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The chemical nature of the antibacterial substance was identified by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. The antibacterial activity was reduced by the action of these enzymes pointing out its peptide nature. It was observed from the growth and production kinetics that the bacteriocin was produced in the eighth hour of incubation, i.e., during the mid-log growth phase of the bacteria.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Effect of packaging technology on microbiological and sensory quality of a cooked blood sausage, Morcela de Arroz, from Monchique region of Portugal.
AB  - Morcela de Arroz (MA), a popular Portuguese blood sausage, with high pH and water activity (aw), is traditionally commercialized without preservatives and unpacked. This study evaluated the best packaging solution to extend MA shelf life stored at 4+/-1 degrees C for 44days: without packaging (WP), vacuum (VP) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) (80% CO2; 20% N2). Mesophilic (MTVC), psychrotrophic (PTVC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), pseudomonads, molds and yeasts, Enterobacteriaceae, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, sensory properties, pH, moisture and aw were studied. Moisture and aw decreased (p<0.05) in WP. pH decreased in WP and MAP during storage. MTVC and PTVC counts increased to values around 7logCFU/g at 44days of storage. LAB and Enterobacteriaceae counts were higher (p<0.05) in VP. Pseudomonads were inhibited (p<0.05) by MAP after 8days of storage. Sensory parameters were affected (p<0.05) by packaging and storage time. Globally, MAP performed better.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from Australian dairy farm environments.
AB  - The ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. In dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. This survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3 caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in Victoria, Australia. A total of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. The prevalence of the Bacillus cereus group, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cronobacter, Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and Yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. The 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the B. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by Cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. The highest occurrence of any pathogen was the B. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. Fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. Salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. Out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. All of the CPS were Staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. Pathogenic Listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 L. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 L. monocytogenes-positive water sample. Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a single raw milk sample. Cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms, predominantly in feed samples. No Y. enterocolitica was detected. Results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. Monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as Cl. perfringens and B. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.
TI  - Clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  - Some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. These Gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include Clostridium botulinum (C2 toxin), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile toxin or CDT), Clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or BEC), Clostridium spiroforme (C. spiroforme toxin or CST), as well as Bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or VIP). These gut-acting proteins form an AB complex composed of ADP-ribosyl transferase (A) and cell-binding (B) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. Once inside the cytosol, the A components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-ADP-ribosylation of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. Important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.
TI  - Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. Discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. As a unique class II lantibiotic, bovicin HJ50 is produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. By using its precursor BovA as a drive sequence, 16 BovA-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. From them, three representative novel lan loci from Clostridium perfringens D str. JGS1721, Bacillus cereus As 1.348 and B. thuringiensis As 1.013 were identified by PCR screening. The corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. Further analysis indicated that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin HJ50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. This study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (PLTs) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. We evaluated the BacTx assay (Immunetics, Inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis- and whole blood-derived PLT units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools, inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the BacTx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. Specificity on sterile PLTs and reproducibility across different PLT units and assay kit lots was also determined. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. In time-to-detection studies after inoculation of PLTs with 0.7 to 5.3 CFUs/mL, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 PLT units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. Specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The BacTx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) CFUs/mL threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. These findings suggest that the BacTx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in PLT units and pools near time of use.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - Inactivation and ultrastructure analysis of Bacillus spp. and Clostridium perfringens spores.
AB  - Bacterial endospores are resistant to many environmental factors from temperature extremes to ultraviolet irradiation and are generally more difficult to inactivate or kill than vegetative bacterial cells. It is often considered necessary to treat spores or samples containing spores with chemical fixative solutions for prolonged periods of time (e.g., 1-21 days) to achieve fixation/inactivation to enable electron microscopy (EM) examination outside of containment laboratories. Prolonged exposure to chemical fixatives, however, can alter the ultrastructure of spores for EM analyses. This study was undertaken to determine the minimum amount of time required to inactivate/sterilize and fix spore preparations from several bacterial species using a universal fixative solution for EM that maintains the ultrastructural integrity of the spores. We show that a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde with 1% glutaraldehyde inactivated spore preparations of Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Clostridium perfringens in 30 min, and Bacillus subtilis in 240 min. These results suggest that this fixative solution can be used to inactivate and fix spores from several major groups of bacterial spore formers after 240 min, enabling the fixed preparations to be removed from biocontainment and safely analyzed by EM outside of biocontainment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Synergistic action of cinnamaldehyde with silver nanoparticles against spore-forming bacteria: a case for judicious use of silver nanoparticles for antibacterial applications.
AB  - Silver has long been advocated as an effective antimicrobial. However, toxicity issues with silver have led to limited use of silver in nanoform, especially for food preservation. With the aim of exploring combinatorial options that could increase the antibacterial potency of silver nanoparticles and reduce the effective dosage of silver, we evaluated the extent of synergy that a combination of silver nanoparticles and an essential oil representative (cinnamaldehyde) could offer. A battery of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains was utilized for antibacterial assays, and extents of synergism were calculated from fractional inhibitory concentration indices. The activity of nanoparticles was greatly enhanced when utilized in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. We observed combinatorial effects that were strongly additive against all the bacterial strains tested, and genuine synergy was found against spore forming Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens - bacterial strains associated with release of cytotoxins in contaminated food and known for their persistence. Bacterial kill curve analysis revealed a very fast bactericidal action when a combination of two agents was used. The electron and atomic force microscopy also revealed extensive damage to the bacterial cell envelop in the presence of both agents. We also performed hemolysis assays to investigate and approximate the extent of toxicity exhibited by the two agents, and observed no adverse effect at the concentrations required for synergy. This study shows that safe levels of silver in nanoform in combination with essential oil component cinnamaldehyde can be effectively used for controlling the spore-forming bacterial species.
TI  - [Diagnosis and control of human food poisoning outbreaks].
AB  - Medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. Bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially Norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. Culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. These new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified, and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.
TI  - New derivatives of salicylamides: Preparation and antimicrobial activity against  various bacterial species.
AB  - Three series of salicylanilides, esters of N-phenylsalicylamides and 2-hydroxy-N-[1-(2-hydroxyphenylamino)-1-oxoalkan-2-yl]benzamides, in total thirty target compounds were synthesized and characterized. The compounds were evaluated against seven bacterial and three mycobacterial strains. The antimicrobial activities of some compounds were comparable or higher than the standards ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or isoniazid. Derivatives 3f demonstrated high biological activity against Staphylococcus aureus (0.03mumol/L), Mycobacterium marinum (0.40mumol/L) and Mycobacterium kansasii (1.58mumol/L), 3g shows activity against Clostridium perfringens (0.03mumol/L) and Bacillus cereus (0.09mumol/L), 3h against Pasteurella multocida (0.03mumol/L) and M. kansasii (0.43mumol/L), 3i against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and B. cereus (0.03mumol/L). The structure-activity relationships are discussed for all the compounds.
TI  - Sphingomyelin regulates the transbilayer movement of diacylglycerol in the plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.
AB  - Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a key component in lipid metabolism and signaling. Previous model membrane studies using DAG analogs suggest their rapid membrane transbilayer movement. However, little is known about the DAG distribution and dynamics in cell membranes. Using live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we monitored the transbilayer movement of DAG with the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged C1AB domain from protein kinase C-gamma (EYFP-C1AB), which selectively binds DAG. When HeLa cells were treated with Bacillus cereus phospholipase C (Bc-PLC) to produce DAG on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, intracellularly expressed EYFP-C1AB probe accumulated at the plasma membrane, indicating the transbilayer movement of the outer leaflet DAG to the inner leaflet. This Bc-PLC-induced translocation of EYFP-C1AB probe to the plasma membrane was not observed in the sphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, but was recovered after cell treatment with sphingomyelinase or preincubation with an inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis. The inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin (SM) on the transbilayer movement of DAG was reproduced in model membranes using a fluorescent short-chain DAG analog. These results demonstrate that the SM content on the outer leaflet regulates the transbilayer movement of DAG in the plasma membrane, thus providing new insights into the dynamics of DAG in cell pathophysiology.
TI  - Foodborne disease outbreaks caused by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus--United States, 1998-2008.
AB  - From 1998 to 2008, 1229 foodborne outbreaks caused by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus were reported in the United States; 39% were reported with a confirmed etiology. Vomiting was commonly reported in B. cereus (median, 75% of cases) and S. aureus outbreaks (median, 87%), but rarely in C. perfringens outbreaks (median, 9%). Meat or poultry dishes were commonly implicated in C. perfringens (63%) and S. aureus (55%) outbreaks, and rice dishes were commonly implicated in B. cereus outbreaks (50%). Errors in food processing and preparation were commonly reported (93%), regardless of etiology; contamination by a food worker was only common in S. aureus outbreaks (55%). Public health interventions should focus on these commonly reported errors to reduce the occurrence of outbreaks caused by B. cereus, C. perfringens, and S. aureus in the United States.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - Postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - The distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in Cote d'Ivoire, and their roles in the food poisoning were evaluated. Microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus spores, fungi and Clostridium perfringens. The results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged, respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter amnigenus, Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Thamnidium spp., Fusarium spp., Moniliella spp. the fungi. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not found. The occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in Cote d'Ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system during the production. Attieke is especially a well-known product in West Africa; hence, it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. Overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - Consumption of foods containing Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. Given the fact that over the past decade, Canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA on foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada. Between January 2007 and December 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). These foods were screened for: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, S. aureus, Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella spp., and Yersinia spp. S. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. The S. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. Methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. These findings indicate that the presence of S. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although MRSA was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0174-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
TI  - Foodborne outbreaks surveillance in the Piedmont Region, Italy (2002-2009).
AB  - BACKGROUND: this article summarises the results of eight years (2002-2009) of investigations on food borne disease outbreaks carried out the Regional Agency for Public Health in Piedmont, which is an Italian Region (4,432,571 citizens, 2008). METHODS: the investigations were conducted as cohort studies supported by laboratory analysis of: food and patients. The data were reported by general practitioners and hospital physicians, and were collected, evaluated and recorded in 22 Hospitals. RESULTS: it recorded 803 outbreaks of food borne disease, of which 177 mushroom outbreaks with 318 ill people and 499 outbreaks for all the others agents with 3,381 ill people. The maximum prevalence was 15.7/100,000 (2004). The most important causes for numbers of ill people have been (2002-2009): salmonellosis (34%, 1,250/3,699), mushroom poisoning (9%, 318/3,699), Escherichia coli (8%, 228/3,699), Staphyilococcus (6%, 209/3,699), virus (5%, 198/3,699), Clostridium perfringens (4%, 154/3,699), Bacillus cereus (2.1%, 76/3,699), scombrotoxin (1.8%, 65/3,699). 303 out of 304 mushrooms outbreaks occurred from consumers that picking mushrooms themselves to eat in private homes and for all others agents: 57% of 499 the outbreaks occurred in private homes, 27% in restaurants, 6% in canteens, but 39% of 3,381 ill people had eaten in restaurants and other public food facilities, 32% in private homes and 24% in canteens. After mushrooms the eggs (75 outbreaks) were the most important food recognized. CONCLUSION: the theoretical maximum prevalence which can be hypothesized with this data in Piedmont (2002-2009) is 141/100,000 (sum of the maximum prevalence recorded at least in one Piedmont Hospital district).
TI  - Oxygen measurements in platelet fluids - a new non-invasive method to detect bacterial contaminations in platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The residual risk for bacterial contamination in blood components especially in platelets is one to two orders of magnitude higher than for transfusion relevant viral infections. The majority of all bacterial transmitted fatalities occurred at the end of platelet shelf life. Therefore, the maximum shelf life of platelet concentrates (PC) was reduced to 4 days after blood donation in Germany in 2008. METHODS: A new continuous non-invasive bacterial detection method was developed by O(2) measurements in the platelet fluids and tested with 10 transfusion relevant bacteria species. RESULTS: The bacterial concentration at the time point of a positive signal of PreSense O(2) ranged between 10(2) and 10(5) CFU mL(-1) . Harmful transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection would have probably been prevented by this novel technology. Only strict anaerobic bacteria strains like Clostridium perfringens were not detected within the study period of 72 h. CONCLUSIONS: The described non-invasive bacterial detection method represents a new approach to prevent transmission of bacterial infection in platelets. The method is characterised by the advantage that all investigations can be performed until right up to the time of transfusion, and therefore, reduce the risk for sample errors to a minimum.
TI  - Assessment of microbial quality of commercial and home-made tiger-nut beverages.
AB  - AIMS: We aimed to assess the microbiological quality of Spanish commercial tiger-nut beverages as well as home-made samples collected from supermarkets, street vendors, juice bars and ice-cream parlours located in Valencia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of 44 tiger-nut beverages samples were carried out according to International Standard Organization (ISO) norms and published works which included the total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, yeasts, moulds, Yersinia enterocolitca, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. The obtained results indicated that all the commercial samples were below the detection limit for the viable microorganisms. Results of analysis of those home-made tiger-nut samples revealed that 67% (16 samples) harboured total plate counts while the rest of samples were free from these microorganisms. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 62% (15 samples). E. coli were found in only one sample (4%), yeasts and moulds were detected in 62% (15 samples) each, Shigella was found in 21% (five samples); however, all samples were free from S. aureus, Salmonella, Y. enterocolotica, C. perfringens, Vibrio spp. and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: These results reflected that there exists a rather high contamination level in home-made tiger-nut beverages indicating the need to apply correct and strict HACCP system(s) during manufacturing and storage of these food products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently in these products and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system (s). Tiger-nut beverages are especially well-known products in Spain, hence it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health.
TI  - Evaluation in broilers of the probiotic properties of Pichia pastoris and a recombinant P. pastoris containing the Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin gene.
AB  - The probiotic properties of Pichia pastoris and of a recombinant P. pastoris containing the Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin gene were evaluated in broilers. One-day-old chicks randomly divided in four groups were fed with commercial feed devoid of antibacterials. The control group (1) received plain food, while the other groups were supplemented with either P. pastoris (2), the recombinant P. pastoris (3) or Bacillus cereus var. Toyoi (4). At day 49, live weights, feed efficiency and seroconversions were higher (P<0.05) in the supplemented groups than in the control groups. Group 3 showed the best results, while group 2 had lower weight gain than groups 3 and 4 although food conversion was better than in group 4. Seroconversions were not different (P>0.05) among the supplemented groups. Adverse reactions were not observed in histopathologic evaluation. We concluded that P. pastoris and the recombinant P. pastoris could be used as probiotics in broilers.
TI  - Diversity and bioactive potential of endospore-forming bacteria cultured from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans.
AB  - AIMS: Despite the frequent isolation of endospore-formers from marine sponges, little is known about the diversity and characterization of individual isolates. The main aims of this study were to isolate and characterize the spore-forming bacteria from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans and to examine their potential as a source for bioactive compounds. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bank of presumptive aerobic spore-forming bacteria was isolated from the marine sponge H. simulans. These represented c. 1% of the total culturable bacterial population. A subgroup of thirty isolates was characterized using morphological, phenotypical and phylogenetic analysis. A large diversity of endospore-forming bacteria was present, with the thirty isolates being distributed through a variety of Bacillus and Paenibacillus species. These included ubiquitous species, such as B. subtilis, B. pumilus, B. licheniformis and B. cereus group, as well as species that are typically associated with marine habitats, such as B. aquimaris, B. algicola and B. hwajinpoensis. Two strains carried the aiiA gene that encodes a lactonase known to be able to disrupt quorum-sensing mechanisms, and various isolates demonstrated protease activity and antimicrobial activity against different pathogenic indicator strains, including Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The marine sponge H. simulans harbours a diverse collection of endospore-forming bacteria, which produce proteases and antibiotics. This diversity appears to be overlooked by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods that do not specifically target sporeformers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Marine sponges are an as yet largely untapped and poorly understood source of endospore-forming bacterial diversity with potential biotechnological, biopharmaceutical and probiotic applications. These results also indicate the importance of combining different methodologies for the comprehensive characterization of complex microbial populations such as those found in marine sponges.
TI  - [Molecular mechanism of bacterial sphingomyelinase C].
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different degree of hydrolysis of palm kernel expeller  peptides against spore-forming and non-spore-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine inhibitory effect of palm kernel expeller (PKE) peptides of different degree of hydrolysis (DH %) against spore-forming bacteria Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Clostridium perfringens; and non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli, Lisinibacillus sphaericus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A range of DH % (50-100) of PKE peptides was prepared using alcalase, and hydrolysis conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). The influence of pH (6.5-10.5), temperature (35-65 degrees C), enzyme/substrate ratio (1-5%) and substrate concentration (1-2%) were studied on the response of the DH. The antibacterial activity of different DH % of PKE peptides was tested by using disc diffusion assay and micro-broth dilution assay. According to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test on each of the PKE peptides of different DH %, the 70 DH % PKE peptide showed greater inhibitory effect compared to the 100 DH % PKE peptide against B. cereus, B. coagulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. stearothermophillus, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Cl. perfringens, Lisinibacillus sphaericus and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The 70 DH % PKE peptides exhibited greatest overall antibacterial effect of the various peptides of PKE evaluated. Further research is needed to determine the mode of action of PKE peptides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Palm kernel expeller peptides, a natural plant product, effectively inhibited the growth of spore-forming and non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Potentially, PKE peptides could be used in food preservation and developed as antibacterial agent in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Development and validation of stable reference materials for food microbiology using Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens spores.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a new type of microbiological Reference Materials (RMs), displaying long-term stability at room temperature. The purpose was to produce and validate two batches of RMs for the enumeration of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The RMs were based on spores of B. cereus and Cl. perfringens, adsorbed on calcium carbonate pellets. Two batches of 1000 units were manufactured and validated in compliance with ISO guide 35. After verification of their homogeneity, the stability of the 'RM-B. cereus' and 'RM-Cl. perfringens' batches was proven during at least 36 and 9 months, respectively, at room temperature. The validation study was completed by international collaborative trial involving 12 laboratories, allowing the validation of the assigned values. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology developed in this work enabled to produce easy-to-handle and cost-effective RMs, displaying an unprecedented stability at room temperature, a good homogeneity and a precise and validated assigned value. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed new paths for the development of stable microbiological RMs. Overcoming the intrinsic instability of the living cells makes it possible to produce valuable tools for the quality assurance of microbiology laboratories.
TI  - [Microbiological evaluation of ready-to-eat foods manufactured by small Costa Rican industries].
AB  - Ready-to-eat (RTE) foods are processed foodstuffs which have gained popularity in recent times because they can be ingested without further thermic treatments. In this work, the microbiological quality and safety of 90 samples of RTE foods manufactured by small Costa Rican industries was determined to evaluate whether they represent a Public Health risk. Twenty-six samples of pickled vegetables, 18 dips, 18 salads, and 12 sweet treats were studied. Each sample was analyzed with regard to its pH, the presence of culturable microbiological quality indicators and recognized foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes. Clostridium perfringens, C. botulinum, and Bacillus cereus) Selected genes encoding toxins of C. botulinum and C. perfringens were screened by PCR. Thirty-seven percent of the samples had a level of acidity that could allow the growth and proliferation of bacterial pathogens (pH > or = 4.5). The shelf-life indicators were acceptable but only if the RTE foods are kept at adequate conditions of temperature and humidity. Sixty-four percent of the RTE foods had total coliforms values that evidence inadequate hygiene practices during its elaboration (MPN/g >1000). This result was confirmed by the finding of fecal coliforms in 56% of the samples, which, by the way, are inacceptable for human consumption. All cultures for pathogens were negative, except for 4 samples that contained B. cereus. Toxins of C. botulinum were not detected and one single sample was positive for the PCR for C. perfringens. The elevated degree of fecal contamination detected in the RTE could be prevented by means of good manufacturing practices, better hygiene measures and a deeper attention to critical control points.
TI  - Hot water surface pasteurisation of lamb carcasses: microbial effects and cost-benefit considerations.
AB  - Although hot water pasteurisation of carcasses is accepted as a general intervention in USA, this is not the case in Europe. The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the microbiological effects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses, both after slaughtering and dressing and following subsequent chilling and storage; (ii) to discuss hot water pasteurisation from a public health and cost-benefit perspective; (iii) to discuss the benefits of hot water pasteurisation compared with use of separate meat processing streams for high-risk carcasses; (iv) to evaluate the use of recycled hot water in a hygienic context and in relation to EU regulations; and (v) to consider the technological and sensory aspects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses. Samples were collected from 420 naturally contaminated lamb carcasses, with 50% of the carcasses (n=210) subject to hot water pasteurisation at 82 degrees C for 8s immediately after slaughter. Surface swab samples from 4500 cm(2) areas on carcasses were collected at slaughter, after chilling for 24 h, and after chilling for five days. The microbial analyses included Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and aerobic plate count (APC). A resuscitation step using Tryptone Soya Agar was included in the microbiological analyses. Hot water pasteurisation significantly reduced the levels of E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, B. cereus and APC (all P<0.001). E. coli colony forming unit (CFU) reduction was 99.5%, corresponding to a reduction of 1.85 log CFU per carcass. E. coli was isolated from 66% of control carcasses and from 26% of pasteurised carcasses. After 24h storage, the reduction in E. coli was increased to 2.02 log, and after five days E. coli could not be isolated from the pasteurised carcasses. These results suggest that surface pasteurisation could be an important and efficient procedure (critical control point) for reducing generic E. coli and thereby shiga toxin-producing E. coli on carcasses, and thus the risk for disease among consumers. The recycled water had acceptable physical and chemical parameters and no spore-forming bacteria were detected. Although some carcass discolouration was observed, after 24h the colour was acceptable. Our data provide relevant input for some of the data gaps regarding hot water pasteurisation and indicate that replacing the expensive system of separate processing of high-risk carcasses with hot water surface pasteurisation should be considered as a serious option.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented West African cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  - In this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in Nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. In particular, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE fingerprints identified species related to Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. A more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the Lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the Streptococcaceae family. Interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. For example, L. plantarum, L. pantheris and L. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while W. confusa, Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. Phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Cell-based biosensor for rapid screening of pathogens and toxins.
AB  - Development and validation of a mammalian cell-based biosensor for application in food defense and food safety was investigated. Three prototypes of the biosensor capable of handling different sample types were developed and tested with food and beverages. The sensing element is a B lymphocyte Ped-2E9 cell-line, encapsulated in collagen matrix in 3D scaffold. The uniqueness of this biosensor is that it detects analyte interaction with mammalian cells and is able to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic and active from inactive toxins, rendering accurate estimation of the risk associated with the agents. This sensor gave positive signal for a broad range of bacterial pathogens; Listeria monocytogenes, enterotoxigenic Bacillus, Vibrio, Micrococcus and Serratia, and toxins; alpha-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus, phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens, cytolysin from sea anemone Stoichactis helianthus, listeriolysin O from L. monocytogenes, and enterotoxin from Bacillus. Detection limit for toxins was 10-40 ng in 2 h while for a model bacterial pathogen, L. monocytogenes, 10(3)-10(4) CFU/ml in 4-6 h, even in the presence of a mixture of higher concentrations of non-pathogenic species of the same genera or common background microflora. With inoculated food and beverage, the sensor detected L. monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus at a low initial concentration of 10(2)-10(4) CFU/g from ready-to-eat meat and rice, and only active toxins at nanogram quantities from rice, milk and water samples. Though all the three prototypes performed well with beverages, Devices II & III are most suitable for testing particulate foods. These data present promising evidence for possible application of this biosensor for rapid detection of multiple pathogens or toxins for food defense and food safety application.
TI  - Hemolysis induced by Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase.
AB  - Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase (Bc-SMase) induces hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes which contain large amounts of sphingomyelin. We investigated the mechanism of this hemolysis in comparison to that induced by Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Pertussis toxin, a Gi-specific inhibitor, N-oleoylethernolamine, a ceramidase inhibitor, and dihydrosphingosine, a sphingosine kinase inhibitor, did not inhibit the hemolysis by Bc-SMase, but did inhibit that by alpha-toxin. Bc-SMase broadly bound to whole membranes, and alpha-toxin specifically bound to the detergent-resistant membrane fractions, lipid rafts. The level of ceramide production induced by Bc-SMase in sheep erythrocytes was 6- to 15-fold that induced by alpha-toxin, when the extent of the hemolysis by Bc-SMase was the same as that by the toxin. However, the level of ceramide production induced by Bc-SMase in SM-liposomes was equal to that triggered by the toxin, when the carboxyl fluorescein-release from liposomes induced by Bc-SMase was the same as that induced by alpha-toxin. Confocal laser microscopy showed that treatment of the cells with Bc-SMase resulted in the formation of ceramide-rich domains. A photobleaching analysis suggested that treatment of the cells with Bc-SMase leads to a reduction in membrane fluidity. These results show that Bc-SMase-induced hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes is related to the formation of interface between ceramide-rich domains and ceramide-poor domains through production of ceramide from SM.
TI  - [Myonecrosis in users of injecting drugs (a clinical case)].
AB  - Myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. Clostridia (C. perfringens, C. novyi, C. septicum, C. sordellii, C. histolyticum) are dominant and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. Cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. Russia has become the largest opiate market in Europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. In the Russian Federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results in a rise of cases of Clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. Gas gangrene in HIV-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. The analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in HIV-positive patients.
TI  - Microbiological quality of saffron from the main producer countries.
AB  - A microbiological study of saffron spice was undertaken in the context of a European research project (Methodologies for Implementing International Standards for Saffron Purity and Quality, the acronym for which is SAFFIC), analyzing 79 samples obtained from the main producer countries, namely Greece, Iran, Italy, Morocco, and Spain. Current microbiological quality criteria are the same as for other spices, but saffron is added in minute quantities during the cooking process, so the health risk associated with microbial contamination might be lower. We did not detect Salmonella either by culture or by PCR methods in any sample, and Escherichia coli was only found in five samples. Enterobacteriaceae were frequently found (70.9% of the samples), but most of them belonged to species of probable environmental origin. Aerobic sporulated bacteria were also common, but only three samples contained Bacillus cereus at low levels (<200 CFU g(-1)). Clostridium perfringens counts were also very low, with only one sample reaching >100 CFU g(-1), an acceptable value. Overall, microbial contamination in saffron was markedly lower than it was in other spices.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  - AIM: To develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (RDB) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. METHODS: The 12 intestinal pathogens tested were Salmonella spp., Brucella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two universal primers were designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16S and 23S rDNA genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. Five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved RDB assay. RESULTS: The methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 CFUs. The consistent detection rate of the improved RDB assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. CONCLUSION: The hybridization results indicated that the improved RDB assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools in Wales, United Kingdom.
AB  - A survey of the general microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools was undertaken across Wales, United Kingdom. Of the 2,351 samples taken, four were identified as containing unsatisfactory counts of Escherichia coli, four contained unsatisfactory counts of Staphylococcus aureus, and one contained an unacceptable count of Bacillus cereus when compared with guidelines for the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food published by the United Kingdom Public Health Laboratory Service in 2000. No samples contained detectable levels of Salmonella, Listeria species, or Clostridium perfringens. When compared with data on the general microbiological quality of food available in Wales, the food sampled from schools was of relatively better microbiological quality.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiological safety of dried spices and herbs from production and retail premises in the United Kingdom.
AB  - A study of dried spices and herbs from retail and production premises to determine the microbiological status of such products was undertaken in the UK during 2004. According to EC Recommendation 2004/24/EC and European Spice Association specifications, 96% of 2833 retail samples and 92% of 132 production batches were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. Salmonella spp. were detected in 1.5% and 1.1% of dried spices and herbs sampled at production and retail, respectively. Overall, 3.0% of herbs and spices contained high counts of Bacillus cereus (1%, > or =10(5) cfu g(-1)), Clostridium perfringens (0.4%, > or =10(3) cfu g(-1)) and/or Escherichia coli (2.1%, > or =10(2) cfu g(-1)). Ninety percent of samples examined were recorded as being 'ready-to-use', 96% of which were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. The potential public health risk of using spices and herbs as an addition to ready-to-eat foods that potentially undergo no further processing is therefore highlighted in this study. Prevention of microbial contamination in dried herbs and spices lies in the application of good hygiene practices during growing, harvesting and processing from farm to fork, and effective decontamination. In addition, the importance of correct food handling practices and usage of herbs and spices by end users cannot be overemphasised.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of xanthorrhizol isolated from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb.  against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Xanthorrhizol, isolated from the ethanol extract of Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb., is a sesquiterpene compound with a molecular weight of 218. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of xanthorrhizol against foodborne pathogens. The antibacterial activity of xanthorrhizol was measured in terms of the MIC and the MBC. MICs and MBCs of xanthorrhizol against Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 8, 16, 8, 8, 16, 8 microg/ml and 16, 32, 16, 16, 16, 16 microg/ml, respectively. The bactericidal study, as determined by the viable cell count method, revealed that xanthorrhizol treatment at 4 x MIC reduced viable cells by at least 6 to 8 log for all six foodborne pathogens in 4 h. Xanthorrhizol maintained its antibacterial activity after thermal treatments (121 degrees C, 15 min) under various pH ranges (pH 3.0, 7.0, and 11.0). These results strongly suggest that xanthorrhizol, conferring strong antibacterial activity with thermal and pH stability, can be effectively used as a natural preservative to prevent the growth of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Erythrophore cell response to food-associated pathogenic bacteria: implications for detection.
AB  - Cell-based biosensors have been proposed for use as function-based detectors of toxic agents. We report the use of Betta splendens chromatophore cells, specifically erythrophore cells, for detection of food-associated pathogenic bacteria. Evaluation of erythrophore cell response, using Bacillus spp., has revealed that this response can distinguish pathogenic Bacillus cereus from a non-pathogenic B. cereus DeltaplcR deletion mutant and a non-pathogenic Bacillus subtilis. Erythrophore cells were exposed to Salmonella enteritidis, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum. Each bacterial pathogen elicited a response from erythrophore cells that was distinguished from the corresponding bacterial growth medium, and this observed response was unique for each bacterial pathogen. These findings suggest that erythrophore cell response has potential for use as a biosensor in the detection and toxicity assessment for food-associated pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against foodborne bacterial strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of aqueous, methanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate extracts from edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against nine foodborne pathogenic bacterial strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, Shigella sonnei, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) was screened with a disk diffusion assay. Twenty-nine of the 48 species tested had antimicrobial activity. Methanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts accounted for 92.8% of the positive assays, whereas the hexane extracts accounted for only 7.2%. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than gram-negative bacteria to fungal extracts, and C. perfringens was the most sensitive microorganism. Aqueous extracts from Clitocybe geotropa and Lentinula edodes had the highest antimicrobial activity against all the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Enteric bacteria isolated from acute diarrheal patients in the Republic of Korea  between the year 2004 and 2006.
AB  - In an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the Republic  of Korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. Among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic Escherichia coli, especially, EAEC was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Shigella species. Distinct seasonality was found in V. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed no age-specific patterns. However, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and B. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. However, both pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. Moreover, S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. In conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.
TI  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an Excel-based software program, Risk Ranger. It is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. Risk scores provided by the tool were characterized as low, medium and high. Also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. Low risk scores were obtained for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) for low risk population. High risk scores were obtained for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). Moderate risk scores for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). Scores for Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for S. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. Campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas Y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. High risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes (high risk population), EHEC (high risk population) or S. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with Campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and HEV (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). Salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. Preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. Only Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes and E. coli EHEC gave moderate risk ratings in case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. These results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a Food Safety Management System.
TI  - Levels and toxigenicity of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens from retail seafood.
AB  - For the period 1990 through 2003, seafood was the most commonly identified food linked to foodborne outbreaks in the United States. Fish as a commodity has rarely been examined for the presence of Bacillus cereus in particular. For the present study, 347 fresh and processed retail seafood samples were examined for the presence of Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, and B. cereus. The presence of C. botulinum was not confirmed in any of the isolates, but C. perfringens was confirmed in 17 samples. One of the C. perfringens isolates possessed the enterotoxin gene, as determined by PCR. In contrast, 62 confirmed B. cereus isolates were obtained from separate samples at levels ranging from 3.6 to > 1,100 CFU/g. Thirty (48%) of 62 isolates produced both the hemolysin BL (HBL) and nonhemolytic (NHE) enterotoxins, and 58 (94%) and 31 (50%) produced NHE or HBL toxins, respectively. The presence of at least one of the three genes of the NHE complex was detected in 99% of the isolates; 69% of the isolates possessed all three genes. In contrast, 71% of the isolates possessed at least one of the three genes of the HBL complex, and 37% possessed all three HBL gene components. Fifty of the 62 B. cereus isolates were from imported seafood, and 19 (38%) of these samples were at levels > 100 CFU/g. Twelve of the 14 highest enterotoxin assay results were from isolates from imported food. Only one B. cereus isolate possessed the cereulide synthetase gene, ces; this isolate also possessed the genes for the three-component HBL and NHE complexes. A majority of enterotoxin-producing isolates were resistant to 2 of 10 antibiotics tested, ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Our results demonstrate the potential of seafood as a vehicle for foodborne illness caused by B. cereus, in particular the enterotoxin-producing genotype.
TI  - Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for Qnr-like PRPs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis in Escherichia coli DH10B. MIC values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and E. coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for PRPs. RESULTS: Amino acid identity of Qnr-like PRPs in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA1, QnrB1 and QnrS1 was in the range of 16% to 22%. Recombinant plasmids coding for Qnr-like PRPs conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/L), depending on the antimicrobial agent and PRP. The PRP from B. subtilis showed no protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: The PRPs analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in E. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in quinolone resistance of PRPs from different gram-positive species. These gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.
TI  - Lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  - Twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, C. perfringens). Two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. Isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as L. crispatus or L. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of S. aureus, B. cereus and E. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. Diarrhea-causing E. coli O8K88H9 Ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of L. reuteri 12/26. Mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of sago starch in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Sago starch is an important food in lowland Papua New Guinea. Extraction of the starch from the palm and storage were performed by way of traditional methods that have been used for thousands of years. Currently, very little is known about the microbiology of sago starch. Sago samples were collected from areas of high starch utilization and analyzed for the presence of bacterial pathogens and indicator organisms. Storage methods and duration were recorded at the time of collection, and pH and water activity on arrival at the laboratory. Sago starch was found to harbor high levels of fecal contamination, as well as various food pathogens including Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. Clostridium perfringens was only present infrequently in samples and in very low numbers, while Listeria monocytogenes was not isolated from sago starch. The presence of high levels of fecal contamination in sago starch is of particular concern, and may contribute to diarrheal disease in rural Papua New Guinea.
TI  - [Investigation of a foodborne intoxication in a high-density penitentiary center].
AB  - BACKGROUND: On September 25 2005, more than 100 inmates (almost 5% of the 1,800 prison population) experienced sudden onset gastroenteritis. This outbreak was the largest foodborne outbreak described in a prison population in Spain. Our objective was to confirm the outbreak, identify risk factors, implement control measures, and provide recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a cohort analysis of a stratified random sample of all the inmates, a cohort analysis of the one of the prison blocks, and an environmental investigation. RESULTS: A total of 221 inmates were selected, of which 196 were interviewed. Twenty-eight percent had gastroenteritis and the main symptoms were abdominal pain (85%) and diarrhea (71%). All foods consumed caused similar attack rates. Factors associated with the risk of illness were eating the entire portion of seafood cocktail at lunch or all of the fried shrimp at dinner on September 24 (RR = 2; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8, and RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1). Analysis of one of the prison blocks yielded results similar to those of the random sample. Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli were isolated from a sample of the seafood cocktail. CONCLUSION: A gastroenteritis outbreak caused by several pa-thogens was confirmed. Both the reported symptoms and the calculated incubation periods corresponded to the pathogens isolated. Preparation of food in prison facilities should meet minimum safety standards, including refrigeration and training of food handlers.
TI  - A systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. DATA SOURCES: Studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. Hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. Specific organisms under review were Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus. Data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. Where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. A decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical UK population. Finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of GPs, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. RESULTS: Good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. Indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. The significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. Economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that PCR for Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli O157 is potentially very successful in identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. Less is known about the benefits of testing for B. cereus, C. perfringens and S. aureus. Further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - The use of clinical profiles in the investigation of foodborne outbreaks in restaurants: United States, 1982-1997.
AB  - Improving the efficiency of outbreak investigation in restaurants is critical to  reducing outbreak-associated illness and improving prevention strategies. Because clinical characteristics of outbreaks are usually available before results of laboratory testing, we examined their use for determining contributing factors in outbreaks caused by restaurants. All confirmed foodborne outbreaks reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1982 to 1997 were reviewed. Clinical profiles were developed based on outbreak characteristics. We compared the percentage of contributing factors by known agent and clinical profile to their occurrence in outbreaks of unclassified aetiology. In total, 2246 foodborne outbreaks were included: 697 (31%) with known aetiology and 1549 (69%) with aetiology undetermined. Salmonella accounted for 65% of outbreaks with a known aetiology. Norovirus-like clinical profiles were noted in 54% of outbreaks with undetermined aetiology. Improper holding times and temperatures were associated with outbreaks caused by Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella, and also with outbreaks of undetermined aetiology that fitted diarrhoea-toxin and vomiting-toxin clinical profiles. Poor personal hygiene was associated with norovirus, Shigella, and Salmonella, and also with outbreaks that fitted norovirus-like and vomiting-toxin clinical profiles. Contributing factors were similar for outbreaks with known aetiology and for those where aetiology was assigned by corresponding clinical profile. Rapidly categorizing outbreaks by clinical profile, before results of laboratory testing are available, can help identification of factors which contributed to the occurrence of the outbreak and will promote timely and efficient outbreak investigations.
TI  - Characteristics of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from dochi-isolated Enterococcus faecium D081821 and D081833.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) from two dochi-isolated Enterococcus faecium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium D081821 and D081833 were isolated from dochi (a traditional fermented food in Taiwan) and found to produce BLIS with inhibitory activities against Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. Strains D081821 and D081833 showed different growth temperatures and their BLIS showed different sensitivities to heat, proteolytic enzymes, and antibacterial spectra. Both BLIS were collected, partially purified, and analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SDS-PAGE showed that both partially purified BLIS were approximately 3.0 kDa in size. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that E. faecium D081821 and D081833 produce different BLIS with strong antibacterial actions against the tested pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study suggest that two different BLIS from dochi-isolated lactic acid bacteria have potential for use as food preservatives.
TI  - Changes in numbers and kinds of bacteria during a chickpea submerged fermentation used as a leavening agent for bread production.
AB  - The microflora developed during a submerged fermentation of coarsely ground chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) in water (primary starter) and during raising a dough from wheat flour (adapted starter) was studied. In the fermenting liquid, only populations of Bacillus and Clostridium developed. Bacilli increased their loads significantly (p<0.05) during fermentation for 8-12 h and then remained constant. Clostridia developed (p<0.05) subsequently to levels of 10(7) cfu/ml at 18 h, when the pH of the fermenting liquid had decreased (p<0.05) to approximately 5.4. It also seems that the rise of the adapted starter within 2 h was caused by enzymes present in the primary starter and those liberated after cell death by the declining populations of bacilli and clostridia. The principal groups of isolates in all fermentation experiments (with chickpea seeds from five different areas) seemed to have the phenotypic characteristics of Bacillus cereus group and Clostridium perfringens. SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins elucidated the taxonomic position of the B. cereus group of strains as B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis and confirmed the phenotypic allocation of C. perfringens isolates. Strains phenotypically characterized as Bacillus licheniformis and Clostridium beijerinckii were also found to belong to these same species by SDS-PAGE. In addition, results showed that the fermenting broth was not toxic to mice when inoculated intraperitoneally and the product can thus be considered as safe for consumption.
TI  - Use of high-affinity cell wall-binding domains of bacteriophage endolysins for immobilization and separation of bacterial cells.
AB  - Immobilization and magnetic separation for specific enrichment of microbial cells, such as the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, depends on the availability of suitable affinity molecules. We report here a novel concept for the immobilization and separation of bacterial cells by replacing antibodies with cell wall-binding domains (CBDs) of bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases (endolysins). These polypeptide modules very specifically recognize and bind to ligands on the gram-positive cell wall with high affinity. With paramagnetic beads coated with recombinant Listeria phage endolysin-derived CBD molecules, more than 90% of the viable L. monocytogenes cells could be immobilized and recovered from diluted suspensions within 20 to 40 min. Recovery rates were similar for different species and serovars of Listeria and were not affected by the presence of other microorganisms. The CBD-based magnetic separation (CBD-MS) procedure was evaluated for capture and detection of L. monocytogenes from artificially and naturally contaminated food samples. The CBD separation method was shown to be superior to the established standard procedures; it required less time (48 h versus 96 h) and was the more sensitive method. Furthermore, the generalizability of the CBD-MS approach was demonstrated by using specific phage-encoded CBDs specifically recognizing Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens cells, respectively. Altogether, CBD polypeptides represent novel and innovative tools for the binding and capture of bacterial cells, with many possible applications in microbiology and diagnostics.
TI  - An outbreak of foodborne diarrheal illness among soldiers in mina during hajj: the role of consumer food handling behaviors.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An investigation of the outbreak was initiated as a result of the number of cases of gastroenteritis reporting to a general hospital in Mina during the pilgrimage to Makkah (HAJJ). This study was conducted to identify the source of the outbreak, assess its extent, and make recommendations to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. METHODOLOGY: A case was defined as any individual who developed diarrhea with or without abdominal pain after eating at the camp in Mina on 3(rd) January 2006. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify food items and circumstances responsible for this outbreak. Laboratory tests included stool cultures of all diarrhea patients, and rectal swabs from all food handlers were cultured for enteric pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 50 Saudi Male Soldiers were interviewed. Out of these, 16 (39%) had developed gastroenteritis, most commonly manifested by diarrhea (100%), and abdominal colic (87.5%). The mean incubation period was 12.6 +/- 4.9 hours and the epidemic curve suggested a common point source outbreak. Out of three served meals, lunch was found to have a statistically significant association with illness (p=0.0230). Out of five food items served, rice was the only food item found to have a statistically significant association with illness (p=0.0230). No food remnants were found for sampling. All results of stool cultures of all diarrhea patients, and rectal swabs from all food handlers were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was most likely caused by eating contaminated rice served at lunch on 3(rd) January. The most likely organisms were Bacillus cereus, and/or Clostridium perfringens. Consuming food that was kept at an unsafe temperature wihout being reheated was the most probable important factor leading to this outbreak.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Thermal inactivation of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens vegetative cells and spores in pork luncheon roll.
AB  - The aim of this study was to design a thermal treatment(s) for pork luncheon roll, which would destroy Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens vegetative cells and spores. B. cereus and C. perfringens vegetative and spore cocktails were used to inoculate luncheon meat. Samples were subjected to different temperatures and removal times. The decimal-reduction times (D-values) were calculated by linear regression analysis (D = -1/slope of a plot of log surviving cells versus time). The log(10) of the resulting D-values were plotted against their corresponding temperatures to calculate (-1/slope of the curve) the thermal resistance (z-values) of each cocktail. The D-values for vegetative cells ranged from 1 min (60 degrees C) to 33.2 min (50 degrees C) for B. cereus and from 0.9 min (65 degrees C) to 16.3 min (55 degrees C) for C. perfringens. The D-values for B. cereus spores ranged from 2.0 min (95 degrees C) to 32.1 min (85 degrees C) and from 2.2 min (100 degrees C) to 34.2 min (90 degrees C) for C. perfringens. The z-values were calculated to be 6.6 and 8.5 degrees C for B. cereus vegetative and spores, respectively, and 7.8 and 8.4 degrees C for C. perfringens vegetative cells and spores, respectively. The D-values of B. cereus and C. perfringens suggest that a mild cook of 70 degrees C for 12s and 1.3 min would achieve a 6 log reduction of B. cereus and C. perfringens vegetative cells, respectively. The equivalent reduction of B. cereus and C. perfringens spores would require the pork luncheon meat to be heated for 36 s at 105 and 110 degrees C, respectively. The results of this study provide the thermal inactivation data necessary to design a cooking protocol for pork luncheon roll that would inactivate B. cereus and C. perfringens vegetative cells and spores. The data may also be used in future risk assessment studies.
TI  - Physicochemical, microbiological, and organoleptic profiles of Greek table olives from retail outlets.
AB  - The physicochemical, microbiological, and organoleptic profile of different commercial table olive products from retail outlets was studied. Average pH values were 4.00, 3.96, and 4.31 for Spanish-style green, naturally black, and dry-salted olives, respectively, while salt content was 6.21, 7.34, and 8.00% for the same commercial products. Mean values for titratable acidity were 0.53 and 0.63% (wt/vol) for green and naturally black olives. In general, mean values for pH, titratable acidity, and salt content were in accordance with the requirements established by the International Olive Oil Council (IOOC) for the trade of table olives, although considerable variation was observed within individual olive samples. Salt content of dry-salted olives did not meet the minimum limit of 10% established by the IOOC. The dominant microbiota consisted of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. Their population was less than 10(9) CFU ml(-1), as stipulated by the IOOC standard for fermented olives held in bulk in a covering liquid. These microorganisms come from the natural microbiota found in spontaneous fermentations and impose no risk to human health. No enterobacteria, pseudomonads, Bacillus cereus, or Clostridium perfringens were detected in any of the samples given the physicochemical characteristics found. The organoleptic profile varied greatly according to processing style and commercial preparation. Green olives had more uniform sensory characteristics than naturally black and dry-salted olives. The most important attributes that influenced the judgment of the panelists were salt content and crispness of the olives.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of fluorogenic substrates for phospholipase D and phospholipase C.
AB  - Fluorogenic analogues of phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine, DDPB and lysoDDPB, were synthesized by an enzyme-assisted strategy. The analogues were evaluated as substrates for phospholipases C and D and lysophospholipase D. DDPB was cleaved by bacterial and plant phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes and represents the first direct fluorogenic substrate for real-time measurement of PLD activity. Both fluorogenic substrates have potential in screening for PLD and PC-PLC inhibitors and for monitoring spatiotemporal changes in PLD activity in cells. [structure: see text]
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of Clostridium perfringens from spices in Argentina.
AB  - Spices can present high microbial counts and Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella and Shigella, among others have been isolated from spices. C. perfringens is an important pathogen agent causing, among other diseases, enteritis in humans caused by C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) which causes human food poisoning and enterotoxemia in domestic animals. The aims of the present work were (i) to establish the hygienic sanitary quality of some spices in San Luis, Argentina; (ii) to determine the presence of C. perfringens in these spices by means of the most probable number (MPN) and count on plate methods; (iii) to characterize the enterotoxigenic strains of C. perfringens by PCR and immunological methods such as reverse passive latex agglutination (RPLA) and (iv) to type by PCR C. perfringens strains isolated. A total of 115 samples of spices, 67 of which were purchased in local retail stores and 48 domestically collected were analysed. Total aerobe counts on tryptone glucose yeast extract agar medium of the 115 samples were between <10 and 10(6) CFU/g. The colifecal counts using Mac Conkey broth of the 115 samples were <4-10(3)CFU/g, with 28 samples (24.34%) exceeding the limit established by the Spanish Alimentary Code (10 CFU/g) while 2 samples (1.73%) had a sulfite reducing anaerobe load above standard limits. A total of 14 C. perfringens strains (12.17%) were isolated and characterized from 115 samples by the standard biochemical tests. Four of which (28.60%) turned out to be enterotoxigenic by PCR and RPLA. In order to type C. perfringens strains based on their main toxins, the 14 strains were analysed by PCR. All strains belonged to type A. All RPLA positive strains were cpe(+) by PCR. The percentage of enterotoxigenic strains was more elevated that those reported in other studies for this type of sample. These results indicate that sanitary conditions in different production stages of species must be improved to reduce health hazards. The high percentage (24.34%) of samples with colifecal values above standard limits is an indication of deficient sanitary conditions. These results suggest the need to provide legislation on the sanitary and hygienic quality of spices in our country.
TI  - Environmental survey for four pathogenic bacteria and closely related species using phylogenetic and functional genes.
AB  - Bacterial species with high DNA sequence similarity to pathogens could affect the specificity of assays designed to detect biological threat agents in environmental samples. The natural presence of four pathogenic bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium perfringens, Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia pestis and their closely related species, was determined for a large collection of soil and aerosol samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing were used using group-specific 16S rRNA primers to identify pathogens and related species, and pathogen-specific virulence genes. Close relatives of B. anthracis (B. cereus group species) were detected in 37% of the soils and 25% of the aerosol samples. The B. anthracis protective antigen (pag) gene or a close homolog was detected in 16 of these samples. For the other three pathogen groups, the frequency of detection was much lower, and none of the samples were positive with both the phylogenetic and virulence gene primer sets.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of nonsterile disposable gloves before use.
AB  - BACKGROUND: After Bacillus cereus recovery in opened boxes of disposable gloves,  the bacteriological contamination of disposable nonsterile gloves kept stored in native packages was investigated prospectively. METHODS: Thirty-six commercially available nonsterile nonpowdered disposable gloves made of latex, vinyl, or nitrile were cultured. RESULTS: A large variety of spore-forming and non-spore-forming bacteria was recovered, including Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. CONCLUSION: This finding must be taken into consideration for care involving gloves in very immunocompromised patients.
TI  - [Symptoms of food-borne diseases and gastroenteritis in Kyushu, Japan].
AB  - In this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: Norovirus, Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shigella sonnei/flexneri (Shigella), Staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type Bacillus cereus. The symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of Kyushu between January 2000 and December 2004 were recorded. The pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was B. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by S. aureus (3.3 h), C. perfringens (10.7 h) and V. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). All the patients infected with B. cereus and S. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. Bloody diarrhea was associated with STEC and Shigella, but rare with other pathogens. Vomiting was associated with almost all cases of S. aureus and B. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the Norovirus cases and 56.1% of the V. parahaemolyticus cases. Vomiting was less common in the C. perfringens (22.0%) and the ETEC and STEC (both about 5%). Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with STEC 0157 infection than with STEC non-0157 infection. Since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.
TI  - [Study of real-time PCR assays for rapid detection of food-borne pathogens].
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit was evaluated for detection of 8 of 19 species of food-borne pathogens, including Plesiomonas shigelloides, Providencia alcalifaciens, in five stool specimens. The time frame was within 2h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 22 pairs of specific primers. The rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes were determined by this LC-PCR assay from 10 cases of food-borne outbreaks in Shimane Prefecture from 2002 to 2005. These cases included Campylobacter jejuni (4), Clostridium perfringens (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and astA positive E. coli (1), and astA positive E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli 026, and Bacillus cereus (1 each). Rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of food-or water-borne pathogenic bacteria in fecal samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food-borne outbreaks.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  - The coordination of food sampling activities across Wales, a part of the United Kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. This surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. The food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. For all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for Escherichia coli, and 0.5% for Listeria spp. Overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. No Campylobacter-positive samples and only one Salmonella-positive sample were found. The analysis of the results show that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current United Kingdom guidelines. The information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.
TI  - Temperature effect on bacterial growth rate: quantitative microbiology approach including cardinal values and variability estimates to perform growth simulations on/in food.
AB  - Temperature effect on growth rates of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus, was studied. Growth rates were obtained in laboratory medium by using a binary dilutions method in which 15 optical density curves were generated to determine one mu value. The temperature was in the range from 2 to 48 degrees C, depending on the bacterial species. Data were analysed after a square root transformation. No large difference between the strains of a same species was observed, and therefore all the strains of a same species were analysed together with the same secondary model. The variability of the residual error, including both measurements errors and biological strain difference, was homogenous for sub-optimal temperature values. To represent this variability in bacterial kinetic simulation, the 95% confidence interval based on an asymptotic Normal distribution, around the growth rate value was determined. With this modelling approach, the behaviour of bacterial species on food, irrespective of the strain or the laboratory, was described. This growth simulation with confidence limits has several applications, such as to facilitate comparisons between a challenge-test and simulation results, and, to appreciate if the temperature change has or has not a significant effect on a bacterial growth profile, with regard to the uncontrolled factors. The integration of this piece of work in the Sym'Previus software is now in process. Results obtained in five French laboratories will be extended by working on new food and new microbial species and improved by further work on variability estimation.
TI  - Screening for bacillus isolates in the broiler gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Spores from a number of different Bacillus species are currently being used as human and animal probiotics, although their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here we describe the isolation of 237 presumptive gut-associated Bacillus spp. isolates that were obtained by heat and ethanol treatment of fecal material from organically reared broilers followed by aerobic plating. Thirty-one representative isolates were characterized according to their morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties as well as partial 16S rRNA gene sequences and screening for the presence of plasmid DNA. The Bacillus species identified included B. subtilis, B. pumilus, B. licheniformis, B. clausii, B. megaterium, B. firmus, and species of the B. cereus group, whereas a number of our isolates could not be classified. Intrinsic properties of potential importance for survival in the gut that could be advantageous for spore-forming probiotics were further investigated for seven isolates belonging to five different species. All isolates sporulated efficiently in the laboratory, and the resulting spores were tolerant to simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. They also exhibited antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including food spoilage and pathogenic organisms such as Bacillus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, the isolates were susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested, arguing that they would not act as donors for resistance determinants if introduced in the form of probiotic preparations. Together, our results suggest that some of the sporeformers isolated in this study have the potential to persist in or transiently associate with the complex gut ecosystem.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Food safety: emerging trends in foodborne illness surveillance and prevention.
AB  - Between 250 and 350 million Americans are estimated to suffer acute gastroenteritis annually, with 25% to 30% thought to be caused by foodborne illnesses. Most vulnerable to foodborne diseases are elderly people, pregnant women, immune-compromised people, and children. While bacterial causes such as Salmonella are widely recognized and monitored as foodborne infections, other important bacterial causes such as Clostridium perfringens , Bacillus cereus , and Staphylococcus aureus are less well known. While the majority of cases of foodborne diseases are of unknown cause, bacteria and viruses are the most likely causative agents. Caliciviridae (Norwalk-like) virus cases are more difficult to identify, but represent the most common cause of known and probably unknown cases. Fresh produce has to be added to the traditional list of foods requiring careful selection and handling to prevent foodborne disease. To assess the disease burden in the United States, morbidity and mortality surveillance activities are done by several networks and systems with collaboration among federal agencies and health departments. Not all important causes are being equally monitored. Critical behaviors by food processors, food retailers, foodservice personnel, and consumers can reduce the risk of foodborne illness episodes. Dietetics professionals can more readily monitor new developments and update knowledge and practice through online resources.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Glycopeptide derived from hen egg ovomucin has the ability to bind enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Ovomucin glycopeptide (OGP) was prepared by size exclusion chromatography after Pronase digestion of hen egg ovomucin, and the binding of OGP to foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus,Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was investigaed. Binding assays with biotinylated bacteria as probes in microtiter plates showed that OGP bound to only E. coli O157:H7 among these foodborne pathogens. Periodate treatment markedly reduced the binding ability, indicating that E. coli O157:H7 bound to carbohydrate moieties of OGP. Lectin blot analysis with Maackia amurensis (MAA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA), which are specific for oligosaccharides containing sialic acid, revealed their binding sites in OGP were similar to the E. coli O157:H7 binding sites that were probed with biotinylated E. coli O157:H7 after Western blotting of OGP. Sialydase treatment of OGP abolished its ability to bind E. coli O157:H7, demonstrating that sialic acid played an important role in the binding. These results suggest that OGP has E. coli O157:H7-specific binding sites that consist of sialic acid. On the basis of these properties, OGP has the potential to be an ingredient with a protective effect against E. coli O157:H7 infection and to be a novel probe for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in the food hygiene field.
TI  - Binary bacterial toxins: biochemistry, biology, and applications of common Clostridium and Bacillus proteins.
AB  - Certain pathogenic species of Bacillus and Clostridium have developed unique methods for intoxicating cells that employ the classic enzymatic "A-B" paradigm for protein toxins. The binary toxins produced by B. anthracis, B. cereus, C. botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. spiroforme consist of components not physically associated in solution that are linked to various diseases in humans, animals, or insects. The "B" components are synthesized as precursors that are subsequently activated by serine-type proteases on the targeted cell surface and/or in solution. Following release of a 20-kDa N-terminal peptide, the activated "B" components form homoheptameric rings that subsequently dock with an "A" component(s) on the cell surface. By following an acidified endosomal route and translocation into the cytosol, "A" molecules disable a cell (and host organism) via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, or inactivation of signaling pathways linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. Recently, B. anthracis has gleaned much notoriety as a biowarfare/bioterrorism agent, and of primary interest has been the edema and lethal toxins, their role in anthrax, as well as the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeting these virulence factors and ultimately B. anthracis. This review comprehensively surveys the literature and discusses the similarities, as well as distinct differences, between each Clostridium and Bacillus binary toxin in terms of their biochemistry, biology, genetics, structure, and applications in science and medicine. The information may foster future studies that aid novel vaccine and drug development, as well as a better understanding of a conserved intoxication process utilized by various gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Bacteriocins are antibacterial substances of a proteinaceous nature that are produced by different bacterial species. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce biologically active peptides or protein complexes that display a bactericidal mode of action almost exclusively toward Gram-positive bacteria and particularly toward closely related species. Generally they are active against food spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. There is an increased tendency to use natural occurring metabolites to prevent the growth of undesirable flora in foodstuffs. These metabolites could replace the use of chemical additives such as sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrite, nitrate, and others. For instance, bacteriocins produced by LAB may be promising for use as bio-preservaties. Bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are typically cationic, hydrophobic peptides and differ widely in many characteristics including molecular weight, presence of particular groups of amino acids, pI, net positive charge, and post-translational modifications of certain amino acids. This heterogeneity within the LAB bacteriocins may explain the different procedures for isolation and purification developed so far. The methods most frequently used for isolation, concentration, and purification involve salt precipitation of bacteriocins from culture supernatants, followed by various combinations of gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In this chapter, a protocol is described that combines several methods used in our laboratory for the purification of two cationic bacteriocins, Lactocin 705AL and Enterocin CRL10, produced by Lactobacillus casei CRL705 and Enterococcus mundtii CRL10, respectively.
TI  - Characterization of Bacillus cereus isolates from raw soybean sprouts.
AB  - Raw soybean sprouts, which are used as ingredients in cook-chilled products, were analyzed to evaluate the incidence of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, psychrotrophic microorganisms, anaerobic microorganisms, coliforms, and spore-forming microorganisms Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium perfringens. Mesophilic microorganisms on raw soybean sprouts were present in large populations, 5.5 x 10(6) to 1.4 x 10(8) CFU/g, and psychrotrophic microorganisms were found to be more numerous than the other groups. Coliforms accounted for 15% of mesophilic microorganism counts on average, and the average for spore-forming microorganisms was 5.2 x 10(2) CFU/g. B. cereus was isolated from 12 of 17 soybean sprout samples, whereas C. botulinum and C. perfringens were not isolated. B. cereus was isolated in greater numbers at 30 degrees C compared with other temperatures and was not isolated at 4 degrees C. Of the 55 strains isolated from soybean sprouts, 52 were positive for starch hydrolysis, and only 3 strains did not hydrolyze starch. Among the 55 strains of B. cereus isolates, 53 showed the ability to produce diarrheal enterotoxin by CRET-RPLA.
TI  - An extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor is involved in a pathway controlling beta-exotoxin I production in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis strain 407-1.
AB  - Beta-exotoxin I is an insecticidal nucleotide analogue secreted by various Bacillus thuringiensis strains. In this report, we describe the characterization and transcriptional analysis of a gene cluster, designated sigW-ecfX-ecfY, that is essential for beta-exotoxin I production in B. thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis strain 407-1. In this strain, the disruption of the sigW cluster resulted in nontoxic culture supernatants. sigW encodes a protein of 177 residues that is 97 and 94% identical to two putative RNA polymerase extracytoplasmic-function-type sigma factors from Bacillus anthracis strain Ames and Bacillus cereus strain ATCC 14579, respectively. It is also 50, 30, and 26% identical to SigW from Clostridium perfringens and SigW and SigX from Bacillus subtilis, respectively. EcfX, encoded by the gene following sigW, significantly repressed the expression of sigW when both genes were overtranscribed, suggesting that it could be the anti-sigma factor of SigW. Following the loss of its curable cry plasmid, strain 407 became unable to synthesize crystal toxins, in contrast to the mutant strain 407-1(Cry-)(Pig+), which overproduced this molecule in the absence of this plasmid. Transcriptional analysis of sigW indicated that this gene was expressed during the stationary phase and only in the 407-1(Cry-)(Pig+) mutant. This suggests that in the wild type-407(Cry+) strain, beta-exotoxin I was produced from determinants located on a cry gene-bearing plasmid and that sigW is able to induce beta-exotoxin I production in B. thuringiensis in the absence of cry gene-bearing plasmids. Although the signal responsible for this activation is unknown, these results indicate that beta-exotoxin I production in B. thuringiensis can be restored or induced via an alternative pathway that requires sigW expression.
TI  - Development and validation of experimental protocols for use of cardinal models for prediction of microorganism growth in food products.
AB  - An experimental protocol to validate secondary-model application to foods was suggested. Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella were observed in various food categories, such as meat, dairy, egg, or seafood products. The secondary model validated in this study was based on the gamma concept, in which the environmental factors temperature, pH, and water activity (aw) were introduced as individual terms with microbe-dependent parameters, and the effect of foodstuffs on the growth rates of these species was described with a food- and microbe-dependent parameter. This food-oriented approach was carried out by challenge testing, generally at 15 and 10 degrees C for L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B. cereus, and Salmonella and at 25 and 20 degrees C for C. perfringens. About 222 kinetics in foods were generated. The results were compared to simulations generated by existing software, such as PMP. The bias factor was also calculated. The methodology to obtain a food-dependent parameter (fitting step) and therefore to compare results given by models with new independent data (validation step) is discussed in regard to its food safety application. The proposed methods were used within the French national program of predictive microbiology, Sym'Previus, to include challenge test results in the database and to obtain predictive models designed for microbial growth in food products.
TI  - The role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  - Bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. Bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, E1 Tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) Escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) Shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) Clostridium difficile (toxins A and B); (f) Staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) Bacillus cereus (cytotoxin K and haemolysin BL); and (h) Aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). The mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane receptor. These effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, IP(3), Ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed Ca2+ and K+ permeable channels, which increase Ca2+ flux and augment changes in Ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane potential. Consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, are affected. The toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. Although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.
TI  - Duplex real-time SYBR green PCR assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (T(m)) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. No interference with the LC-PCR assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. The detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool. The protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. However, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.
TI  - Wessex shopping basket survey - a structured approach to local food sampling.
AB  - The shopping basket approach to food sampling, in which ready-to-eat food items from a shopping list were sampled at premises chosen at random, was adopted by 15 Environmental Health Departments in the Wessex region. A total of 2037 samples were analysed over a 30-month period. The microbiological quality varied considerably between food categories, with gravy and stock samples giving the highest proportion of satisfactory results. Sliced meats, cooked rice and sandwiches gave the poorest overall results. Whilst the majority of unsatisfactory results were due to elevated levels of indicator organisms (Aerobic Colony Count, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli), unsatisfactory or potentially hazardous levels of pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens or Listeria monocytogenes) were detected in 1% of samples. Salmonella was not detected in any sample. The shopping basket survey was considered to be a useful way of structuring local sampling, and the random selection of premises was found to be a considerable advantage over previous sampling plans. In addition, the survey drew attention to a number of microbiological problems with specific food types, leading to more detailed investigations.
TI  - Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  - To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bactericidal effects of Japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. Konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the pH of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). Konjac fluids completely inactivated Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and E. coil O26:H9, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahemolyticus. and Staphylococcus aureus. The initial level of 6 log CFU/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable S. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. On the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum type E and type A). At least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. Vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. When the initial cell count was 6 log CFU/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected after 120 days. When the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log CFU/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within I to 3 days. Repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. Our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.
TI  - Diacylglycerol-rich domain formation in giant stearoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles driven by phospholipase C activity.
AB  - We have studied the effect of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens (alpha-toxin) on giant stearoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (SOPC) vesicles. Enzyme activity leads to a binary mixture of SOPC and the diacylglycerol SOG, which phase separates into a SOPC-rich bilayer phase and a SOG-rich isotropic bulk-like domain embedded within the membrane, as seen directly by phase contrast microscopy. After prolonged enzymatic attack, all bilayer membranes are transformed into an isotropic pure SOG phase as characterized by fluorescence microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence anisotropy measurements, and small angle x-ray scattering. These domains may have biological relevance, serving as storage compartments for hydrophobic molecules and/or catalyzing cellular signaling events at their boundaries. Furthermore, in the early stages of asymmetric enzymatic attack to the external monolayer of giant vesicles, we observe a transient coupling of the second-messenger diacylglycerol to membrane spontaneous curvature, which decreases due to enzyme activity, before domain formation and final vesicle collapse occurs.
TI  - Surviving the acid test: responses of gram-positive bacteria to low pH.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria possess a myriad of acid resistance systems that can help  them to overcome the challenge posed by different acidic environments. In this review the most common mechanisms are described: i.e., the use of proton pumps, the protection or repair of macromolecules, cell membrane changes, production of alkali, induction of pathways by transcriptional regulators, alteration of metabolism, and the role of cell density and cell signaling. We also discuss the responses of Listeria monocytogenes, Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, oral streptococci, and lactic acid bacteria to acidic environments and outline ways in which this knowledge has been or may be used to either aid or prevent bacterial survival in low-pH environments.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Horizontal transfer of drug-resistant aminoacyl-transfer-RNA synthetases of anthrax and Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The screening of new antibiotics against several bacterial strains often reveals  unexpected occurrences of natural drug resistance. Two examples of this involve specific inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus isoleucyl-transfer-RNA synthetase 1 (IleRS1) and, more recently, Streptococcus pneumoniae methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (MetRS1). In both cases, resistance is due to the presence of a second gene that encodes another synthetase (IleRS2 or MetRS2). Here, we show that both S. pneumoniae MetRS2 and S. aureus IleRS2 have closely related homologues in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Furthermore, similar to drug-resistant pathogens, strains of B. anthracis and its closest relative, B. cereus, also have wild-type ileS1 and metS1 genes. Clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gangrene, also has two metS genes, whereas Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from deep-sea sediments has a single ileS2-type gene. This study shows the importance of understanding complex evolutionary networks of ancient horizontal gene transfer for the development of novel antibiotics.
TI  - Methodologies for the characterization of microbes in industrial environments: a  review.
AB  - There is growing interest in research and development to develop novel tools to study, detect, and characterize microbes and their communities in industrial environments. However, knowledge about their validity in practical industrial use is still scarce. This review describes the advantages and limitations of traditional and molecular methods used for biofilm and/or planktonic cell studies, especially those performed with Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and/or Clostridium perfringens. In addition, the review addresses the importance of isolating the microorganisms from the industrial environment and the possibilities and future prospects for exploiting the described methods in the industrial environment.
TI  - Effects of gamma ray and electron-beam irradiations on survival of anaerobic and  facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An extension of the approval for food irradiation is desired due to the increase  in the incidence of food poisoning in the world. One anaerobic (Clostridium perfringens) and four facultatively anaerobic (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella Enteritidis) bacteria irradiated with gamma ray or electron beam (E-beam) were tested in terms of survival on agar under packaging atmosphere. Using pouch pack, effects of two irradiations on survival of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were evaluated comparatively. E-beam irradiation was more effective than gamma ray irradiation in decreasing the D10 value of B. cereus at 4 degrees C, slightly more effective in that of E. coli O157, and similarly effective in that of the other three bacteria at 4 degrees C. The gamma irradiation of the bacteria without incubation at 4 degrees C before irradiation was more effective than that of the bacteria with incubation overnight at 4 degrees C before irradiation in decreasing the D10 values of these bacteria (B. cereus, E. coli O157, and L. monocytogenes). Furthermore, ground beef patties inoculated with bacteria were irradiated with 1 kGy by E-beam (5 MeV) at 4 degrees C. The inoculated bacteria in the 1-9 mm beef patties were killed by 1 kGy E-beam irradiation and some bacteria in more than 9 mm beef patties were not killed by the irradiation.
TI  - Crystal structure and site-directed mutagenesis of enzymatic components from Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin.
AB  - Iota-toxin from Clostridium perfringens type E is an ADP-ribosylating toxin (ADPRT) that ADP-ribosylates actin, which is lethal and dermonecrotic in mammals. It is a binary toxin composed of an enzymatic component (Ia) and a binding component (Ib). Ia ADP-ribosylates G-actin at arginine 177, resulting in the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we report on studies of the structure-function relationship by the crystal structures of Ia complexed with NADH and NADPH (at 1.8 A and 2.1 A resolution, respectively) and mutagenesis that map the active residues. The catalytic C-domain structure was similar to that of Bacillus cereus vegetative insecticidal protein (VIP2), which is an insect-targeted toxin, except for the EXE loop region. However, a significant structural difference could be seen in the N-domain, which interacts with Ib, suggesting an evolutionary difference between mammalian-targeted and insect-targeted ADPRT. The high resolution structure analysis revealed specific NAD conformation (a ring-like conformation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)) supported by Arg295, Arg296, Asn335, Arg352 and Glu380. Additionally, the mutagenesis study showed that the residues Tyr251, Arg295, Glu301, Ser338, Phe349, Arg352 and Glu380, including a newly identified one, are essential for NAD(+)-glycohydrolase (NADase) activity. At least one residue, Glu378, is an essential residue for ADP-ribosyltransferase (ARTase), but not for NADase. Consequently, the structural feature and these mutagenesis findings suggest that the catalytic mechanism of Ia proceeds via an Sn1-type reaction.
TI  - Role of the C-domain in the biological activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (370 residues) possesses hemolytic and lethal activities as well as the enzymatic activity of phospholipase C (PLC). In this study we examined the role of the C-domain (251-370 residues; CP251- 370) in biological activities of the toxin. The N-domain (1-250 residues; CP1- 250) of the alpha-toxin as well as the Bacillus cereus phospholipase C (BcPLC) possessed PLC activity, but did not bind to rabbit erythrocytes and lyse them. A hybrid protein (BC-CP251-370) consisting of BcPLC and CP251- 370 bound to the red cells and lysed them. Incubation of CP1-250 with CP251-370 completely complemented hemolytic and PLC activities. CP251-370 also conferred hemolytic activity on BcPLC. CP251-340 (251-340 residues) significantly stimulated PLC activity of CP1-250), but did not confer hemolytic activity on CP1-250. Kinetic analysis suggested that CP251-370 increased affinity toward the substrate of CP1-250. The results suggested that CP251-370 plays an important role in binding to erythrocytes and the hemolytic and enzymatic activities of CP1-250. Acrylodan-labeled CP251-370 variants (S263C and S365C) bound to liposomes and exhibited a marked blue shift, and in addition, an N,N'-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl)ethylene diamine (NBD)-labeled CP251-370 (S365C) variant also bound to liposomes and the fluorescence intensity significantly increased, suggesting movement of CP251-370 to a hydrophobic environment. These observations suggest that interaction of CP251-370 of alpha-toxin with fatty acyl residues of phosphatidylcholine plays an important role in the biological activities of CP1-250.
TI  - Isolation of nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis WNC 20 strain from nham, a traditional Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - A total of 14,020 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from nham and screened for bacteriocin production. One Lactococcus lactis strain WNC 20 produced a bacteriocin that not only inhibited closely related LAB, but also some food-borne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Biochemical studies revealed that the bacteriocin was heat-stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10). The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K but not other proteases. The antimicrobial spectrum and some characteristics of this bacteriocin were nearly identical to that of nisin. The gene encoding this bacteriocin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with nisin gene-specific primer. Sequencing of this gene showed identical sequences to nisin Z as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis WNC 20 may be useful in improving the food safety of the fermented product.
TI  - An investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  - In 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the UK and Ireland was reported and Clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to C. botulinum and Bacillus cereus were also reported. Because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in England during 2000 and 2002. Two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. The first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (MRD) which was inoculated directly into Clostridium Botulinum Isolation Cooked Meat Broth (CBI). The second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in CBI broth. Duplicate CBI broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min. Subcultures were made after incubation for 7 and 14 days on to eight different solid media. The methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either C. botulinum or C. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. Fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the MRD suspension technique. Fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. No fungi were isolated. Aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at least one species was isolated from each sample. B. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with B. licheniformis isolated from 40%. Between one and five samples yielded cultures of B. coagulans, B. laterosporus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and P. macerans. Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; S. warneri and S. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. One or two samples yielded cultures of S. aureus, S. capitis and S. haemolyticus. The remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with C. perfringens and two samples with either C. sordellii or C. tertium. Multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the remaining 15. In 13 samples B. cereus alone was isolated, in one B. subtilis alone and in one sample B. pumilus alone. C. botulinum and C. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. Recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.
TI  - Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of Clostridium novyi, C. perfringens and Bacillus cereus isolated from injecting drug users during 2000.
AB  - As part of the follow-up investigations associated with an outbreak of severe illness and death among illegal injecting drug users during 2000, 43 cultures of Clostridium novyi type A, 40 C. perfringens type A and 6 isolates of Bacillus cereus were characterised by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Among the 43 C. novyi isolates, 23 different AFLP profiles were detected. The same AFLP profile was detected in isolates from 18 drug users investigated during 2000 from Scotland, England, the Republic of Ireland and Norway and a wound from a patient in 2000 who was not identified as a drug user. Unique AFLP profiles were obtained from four drug users from England and the Republic of Ireland, 10 historical isolates from culture collections, an isolate from food (1989) and three isolates from wounds (1995, 1991, 1988). The 40 C. perfringens isolates were from 13 drug users, the contents of one syringe and two samples of heroin. Sixteen AFLP types of C. perfringens were distinguished and there was little evidence for commonality among the isolates. The AFLP types of C. perfringens from heroin differed and were unique. Six isolates of B. cereus were from four drug users and two samples of heroin. Four different AFLP patterns were distinguished. Three AFLP types were isolated from four drug users. B. cereus isolates from an aspirate and a heroin sample collected from the same drug user were identical, and were also indistinguishable from an isolate from a groin infection in a second drug user. The AFLP type of the isolate from a second and unrelated heroin sample was unique. The AFLP results showed no or very limited evidence for commonality between the different isolates of B. cereus and C. perfringens. In marked contrast, the C. novyi isolates from the majority of the drug users during 2000 were homogeneous, suggesting a common source or clonal selection of a C. novyi type, or both, which either had an adaptive advantage in spore germination, survival or growth following the drug preparation and the injection procedure, or produced a more severe clinical presentation.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated Bacillus sp. Strain 8 A.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by Bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus 8 A was identified. The antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. A crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and several species of Bacillus. Clinically relevant bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. Bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees C, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees C. It was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase K and pronase E. Bacteriocin activity was observed in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. CONCLUSIONS: A bacteriocin produced by Bacillus cereus 8 A was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat cooked foods from a centralized school kitchen in Argentina.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological and sensory quality as well as the safety of ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked foods prepared in and distributed from a centralized kitchen to schools in Argentina. A total of 101 cooked food samples delivered as hot RTE cooked foods (group A) and as RTE cooked foods at room temperature (group B) and 140 surface swab environment samples were collected from February to November 1999. Petrifilm plates were used for aerobic (PAC), coliform (PCC), and Escherichia coli (PEC) counts. Standard methods were used to determine Enterobacteriaceae (EntC) and thermotolerant coliform counts (TCC). Samples were also tested for the presence of Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens. Food temperatures just before samples were put into containers ranged from 80 to 98 degrees C and from 28 to 32 degrees C for group A and group B, respectively. For group A food samples, PAC ranged from 1.04 to 3.50 log CFU/g, and PCC, PEC, TCC, and EntC were not detected. For group B food samples, PAC ranged from 3.63 to 6.48 log CFU/g, PCC ranged from 1.90 to 5.36 log CFU/g, TCC ranged from 1.30 to 3.95 log CFU/g, and EntC ranged from 3.60 to 5.46 log CFU/g. Of the foodborne pathogens, only B. cereus was isolated (63.4% of samples) in both food groups (<4 log CFU/g). The microbiological and sensory quality and the safety of group A foods were satisfactory. Large numbers of PAC and EntC detected in group B foods show that better control is needed to avoid potential foodborne diseases.
TI  - Expression of a small RNA, BS203 RNA, from the yocI-yocJ intergenic region of Bacillus subtilis genome.
AB  - We isolated and characterized a novel small RNA from Bacillus subtilis. We termed this molecule BS203 RNA from the length of its mature form (203 nt) and located the corresponding gene at the yocI-yocJ intergenic region on the B. subtilis genome. Northern blotting revealed that it is transcribed in vegetative growing cells and that the amount of BS203 RNA decreased in the middle of the vegetative phase. A computer-aided prediction of the BS203 RNA secondary structure revealed three characteristic stem-loop structures. Despite active expression during the vegetative phase, growth of the knockout mutant was not affected by depletion of BS203 RNA. A phylogenetic comparison of the sequence of the BS203 RNA with other Bacillus species including B. cereus and B. halodurans C-125, or Clostridium perfringens suggests that the sequence is unique to Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Epidemiologic profiling: evaluating foodborne outbreaks for which no pathogen was isolated by routine laboratory testing: United States, 1982-9.
AB  - The objective was to evaluate foodborne outbreaks of undetermined aetiology by comparing them to pathogen-specific epidemiologic profiles of laboratory-confirmed foodborne outbreaks. National foodborne outbreak data reported to CDC during 1982-9 were categorized by clinico-epidemiologic profiles based on incubation, duration, percent vomiting, fever and vomiting to fever ratio. From the pathogen-specific profiles, five syndromes were developed: a vomiting-toxin syndrome resembling Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus; a diarrhoea-toxin syndrome characteristic of Clostridium perfringens, a diarrhaeogenic Escherichia coli syndrome, a Norwalk-like virus syndrome, and a salmonella like syndrome. Of 712 outbreaks, 624 (87.6%) matched one of five syndromes; 340 (47.8%) matched the Norwalk-like syndrome and 83 (11.7%) matched the salmonella-like syndrome. After combining information on known pathogens and epidemiologic profiles, only 88 (12.4%) outbreaks remained unclassified. Norwalk-like virus outbreaks appear as common as salmonella-like outbreaks. We conclude that profiling can help classify outbreaks, guide investigations and direct laboratory testing to help detect new and emerging pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apheresis (Cobe Leucocyte Reduction System [LRS]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (Optipress) platelet concentrates (PCs) were tested. Six organisms were used for spiking the PCs: Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. On days 0, 2 and 5, BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: The BacT/Alert Automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. In general, as the inoculum concentration increased, the detection time decreased. Rapid growth was obtained with all organisms tested except for B. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. Bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) CFU/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) CFU/ml. Growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that PCs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. Rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. Leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. Bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.
TI  - Mode of action of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins of the staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin family.
AB  - Staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin is the prototype of a family of bacterial exotoxins with membrane-damaging function, which share sequence and structure homology. These toxins are secreted in a soluble form which finally converts into a transmembrane pore by assembling an oligomeric beta-barrel, with hydrophobic residues facing the lipids and hydrophilic residues facing the lumen of the channel. Besides alpha-hemolysin the family includes other single chain toxins forming homo-oligomers, e.g. beta-toxin of Clostridium perfringens, hemolysin II and cytotoxin K of Bacillus cereus, but also the staphylococcal bi-component toxins, like gamma-hemolysins and leucocidins, which are only active as the combination of two similar proteins which form hetero-oligomers. The molecular basis of membrane insertion has become clearer after the determination of the crystal structure of both the oligomeric pore and the soluble monomer. Studies on this family of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins are important for many aspects: (i) they are involved in serious pathologies of humans and farmed animals, (ii) they are a good model system to investigate protein-membrane interaction and (iii) they are the basic elements for the construction of nanopores with biotechnological applications in various fields.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C.
AB  - While searching for a phospholipase C (PLC) specific for phosphatidylcholine in mammalian tissues, we came across such an activity originating from a contamination of Pseudomonas fluorescens. This psychrophilic bacterium was found to contaminate placental extracts upon processing in the cold. The secreted phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing PLC was purified by a combination of chromatographic procedures. As substrates, the enzyme preferred dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine over phosphatidylinositol. The active enzyme is a monomer of approximately 40 kDa. As for other bacterial PLCs, the enzyme requires Ca2+ and Zn2+ for activity; dithiothreitol affected the activity due to its chelation of Zn2+, but this inhibition could be compensated for by addition of ZnCl2. The compound D609, described to selectively inhibit phosphatidylcholine-specific PLCs, caused half-inhibition of the P. fluorescens enzyme at approximately 420 microM, while 50-fold lower concentrations similarly affected PLCs from Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. Partial peptide sequences obtained from the pure P. fluorescens enzyme after tryptic cleavage were used to clone a DNA fragment of 3.5 kb from a P. fluorescens gene library prepared from our laboratory isolate. It contains an ORF of 1155 nucleotides encoding the PLC. There is no significant sequence homology to other PLCs, suggesting that the P. fluorescens enzyme represents a distinct subclass of bacterial PLCs. The protein lacks cysteine residues and consequently contains no disulfide bonds. Interestingly, P. fluorescens reference strain DSMZ 50090 is devoid of the PLC activity described here as well as of the relevant coding sequence.
TI  - Evaluation of microbiological quality of medicinal plants used in natural infusions.
AB  - Consumption of preparations of medicinal plants has been increasing during the last decades in occidental societies. However, there are no effective sanitary controls of these products. To evaluate the nature and content of microbiological contamination, 62 samples of seven medicinal plants (chamomile, leaves of orange tree, flowers of linden, corn silk, marine alga, pennyroyal mint and garden sage) were studied, using conventional microbiological methods. Practically all samples (96.8%) were contaminated with Bacillus cereus; 19.2% of them with levels higher than 10(3) spores/g. The highest levels were found in corn silk samples (> 10(7) spores/g). Spores of Clostridium perfringens were detected in 83.9% of samples, but only 19.2% had levels greater than 10(3)/g. The mean level of fungal population was 10(5.5) cfu/g. Corn silk samples were the most contaminated, with levels above 10(6) cfu/g. Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus and Asp. niger were predominant in all samples with the exception of garden sage samples. Many yeasts were found in chamomile, flowers of linden, corn silk, pennyroyal mint and garden sage. Predominant species were Cryptococcus laurentii (28.1%) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (22.8%). The mean level of Crypt. laurentii contamination in corn silk was greater than 10(4) cfu/g.
TI  - Microbiological status of commercially available medicinal herbal drugs--a screening study.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-eight medicinal herbal drugs obtained from different suppliers were examined for microbial contaminants and for the detectability of pathogenic microorganisms. For this purpose, several microbiological standard parameters (total aerobic mesophilic count, enterobacteria, coliforms, aerobic sporeformers, yeasts and moulds, enterococci, lactobacilli, pseudomonades and aeromades) and selective methods for the detection of indicator microorganisms and pathogens (E. coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Candida albicans, potentially aflatoxigenic moulds) were applied. The microbial load of the samples varied considerably. While none of the samples contained EHEC, Salmonellae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeriae, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, four samples were E. coli positive, two samples were presumptively Campylobacter jejuni positive and nine herbal drugs contained a potentially aflatoxigenic mould flora. Further details regarding different viable count classes as well as preparation techniques are discussed.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - The effect of calcium and sodium lactates on growth from spores of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens in a 'sous-vide' beef goulash under temperature abuse.
AB  - The effect of calcium and sodium lactates on growth from spores of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens at three different concentrations (0, 1.5 and 3% w/w) and at different temperatures (10, 15 and 20 degrees C for B. cereus and 15, 20 and 25 degrees C for C. perfringens) was investigated, using beef goulash as a model system for pasteurised vacuum-packaged convenience foods. Calcium lactate at a level of 3% reduced the pH values of the samples from 6.0 to 5.5. No B. cereus growth was observed at 10 degrees C, but after 7 days at an incubation temperature of 15 degrees C, cell number increased by 1 log cfu/g in the control samples. At this temperature, lactates were seen to be effective at inhibiting growth. Calcium lactate was more inhibitory than sodium lactate as the growth of B. cereus was inhibited at 1.5 and 3% concentrations at 20 degrees C, respectively. Growth of C. perfringens was arrested in the presence of 1.5% calcium lactate at all storage temperatures, whereas growth was inhibited by 3% sodium lactate only at 15 degrees C.
TI  - Microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. For each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. Dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform counts and spore counts. Six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. The incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was also determined. In most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. In addition, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. Mean bacterial counts of water and swab samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.The predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Alcaligenes spp. Bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, Clostridium perfringens in 1%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3% and Vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were not detected. Non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.
TI  - A new cytotoxin from Bacillus cereus that may cause necrotic enteritis.
AB  - A cytotoxin (CytK) has been isolated from a Bacillus cereus strain that caused a  severe food poisoning outbreak killing three people. A protein of 34 kDa was highly cytotoxic, and the addition of other secreted proteins gave no synergistic effect. CytK was also necrotic and haemolytic. No known B. cereus enterotoxins were produced by this strain. A DNA sequence from 1.8 kb upstream to 0.2 kb downstream of the toxin gene was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the toxin showed similarity to Staphylococcus aureus leucocidins, gamma-haemolysin and alpha-haemolysin, Clostridium perfringens beta-toxin and B. cereus haemolysin II, all belonging to a family of beta-barrel channel-forming toxins. There was no sequence similarity between CytK and enterotoxins of B. cereus. The upstream sequence contained a partial sequence of a putative histidine kinase gene. A recognition site for PlcR, which regulates the transcription of enterotoxins HBL and Nhe of B. cereus, was found in the promoter region of the toxin. This new cytotoxin may be responsible for a disease that is similar to, although not as severe as, the necrotic enteritis caused by the beta-toxin of C. perfringens type C.
TI  - New developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media.
AB  - This review describes some recent developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media in microbiological diagnostic. The detection of beta-D-glucuronidase (GUD) activity for enumeration of Escherichia coli is well known. E. coli O157:H7 strains are usually GUD-negative and do not ferment sorbitol. These characteristics are used in selective media for these organisms and new chromogenic media are available. Some of the new chromogenic media make the Salmonella diagnostic easier and faster. The use of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for detection of beta-D-glucosidase (beta-GLU) activity to differentiate enterococci has received considerable attention and new media are described. Rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus are other application of enzyme detection methods in food and water microbiology.
TI  - Control of bacterial spores.
AB  - Bacterial spores are much more resistant than their vegetative counterparts. The  most dangerous spore-former is Clostridium botulinum which produces a potent neurotoxin that can prove fatal. The most common food poisoning from a spore-former is caused by C. perfringens. Other food poisoning spore-formers include Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. There are a number of non-pathogenic spore-formers including butyric and thermophilic anaerobes that cause significant economic losses to food producers. Some unusual spoilage complaints have been reported, for example, B. sporothermodurans in UHT milk, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris in apple and orange juice and Desulfotomaculum nigrificans in hot vending machines. Control of spore-formers requires an understanding of both the resistance and outgrowth characteristics of the spores.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Occurrence of nisin Z production in Lactococcus lactis BFE 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional Nigerian cheese product.
AB  - Screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various African fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing Lactococcus lactis (BFE 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. The bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related LAB, but also strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillis cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. It was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower pH range. The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K, but not by other proteases. Growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 on L. monocytogenes WS 2250 and B. cereus DSM 2301 than with the nisin A producing strain DSM 20729. Polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain BFE 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that Lc. lactis BFE 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin Z, as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The genetic determinants for bacteriocin production in strain BFE 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the African environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Turkish medicinal plants.
AB  - A total of 76 extracts from 35 plants available in the Turkish flora were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against five pathogenic bacteria and a yeast. Sixteen crude extracts from eight plant species were found to possess an activity against at least one or more test microorganisms. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the most active crude extracts was also carried out with the most active extracts. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Candida albicans (yeast) is discussed.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - Fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Food temperatures were recorded at the time of sampling. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (APCs), spore counts (SCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (CCs) for water and swab samples. In addition, Petrifilm Escherichia coli count (PC) plates were used for the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. The presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic E. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. Predominant colonies isolated from APC plates were characterized to the genus level. Holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees C. Mean APC values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log CFU/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Mean SC values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log CFU/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. A mean EC value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g for food samples and mean CC values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/ml and 1.3 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. Mean PC values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log CFU/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log CFU/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, Clostridium perfringens in 16%, Salmonella spp. in 2%, and E. coli (non-O157:H+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. E. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. The 340 isolates obtained from APC plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. It was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.
TI  - Preformed bacterial toxins.
AB  - Food poisoning syndromes caused by four different bacteria are described. For all types, food kept at a permissive temperature allows growth of the vegetative forms of the bacteria and production of a toxin or toxins. The key features of these syndromes, as well as possible new trends of concern, are summarized in Table 1.
TI  - The 105-kDa protein component of Bacillus cereus non-haemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) is a metalloprotease with gelatinolytic and collagenolytic activity.
AB  - A sequence of 91 amino acids residues, probably starting from the N-terminal of the mature protein, was determined for the 105-kDa protein of the non-haemolytic enterotoxin of Bacillus cereus. The last part of this sequence was similar to parts of the N-terminal portions of two collagenases of Clostridium histolyticum and Clostridium perfringens. Zymography, with intact collagen fibril and gelatin as substrates, showed that the 105-kDa protein had collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activity. The 105-kDa protein also showed activity against a typical collagenase substrate, azocoll, and was inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. We conclude that the 105-kDa protein is a collagenase.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with a sorghum-based fermented weaning cereal.
AB  - Microbiological surveys, to determine the quality and safety, were conducted on 45 sorghum samples comprising dry powders (n = 15) and corresponding fermented (n = 15) and cooked fermented porridge (n = 15) samples collected from households in an informal settlement of the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Mean aerobic plate counts, Gram-negative counts and bacterial spore counts of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge samples. However, mean lactic acid bacteria counts increased in fermented porridge samples, but decreased slightly in cooked fermented porridge samples. The mean pH value of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge, respectively. Bacillus (B.) cereus was detected in all 15 sorghum powder samples, while Escherichia (E.) coli was detected in 53%, Clostridium perfringens in 27%, Listeria monocytogenes in 13% and Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp., each in 7% of sorghum powder samples. Of the fermented porridge samples, 40% contained B. cereus and 7% contained E. coli. None of the pathogens tested for were detected in cooked fermented porridge samples. B. cereus (53%), B. subtilis (21%), B. thuringiensis (13%), B. licheniformis (10%) and B. coagulans (3%) were identified from 120 isolates randomly selected from spore count plates of the highest dilution showing growth.
TI  - Characterization, production, and purification of leucocin H, a two-peptide bacteriocin from Leuconostoc MF215B.
AB  - Leuconostoc MF215B was found to produce a two-peptide bacteriocin referred to as  leucocin H. The two peptides were termed leucocin Halpha and leucocin Hbeta. When acting together, they inhibit, among others, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens. Production of leucocin H in growth medium takes place at temperatures down to 6 degrees C and at pH below 7. The highest activity of leucocin H in growth medium was demonstrated in the late exponential growth phase. The bacteriocin was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion-exchange (SP Sepharose) and reverse phase chromatography. Upon purification, specific activity increased 10(5)-fold, and the final specific activity was 2 x 10(7) BU/OD280. Amino acid composition analyses of leucocin Halpha and leucocin Hbeta indicated that both peptides consisted of around 40 amino acid residues. Their N-termini were blocked for Edman degradation, and the methionin residues of leucocin Hbeta did not respond to Cyanogen Bromide (CNBr) cleavage. Absorbance at 280 nm indicated the presence of tryptophan residues and tryptophan-fracturing opened for partial sequencing by Edman degradation. From leucocin Halpha, the sequence of 20 amino acids was obtained; from leucocin Hbeta the sequence of 28 amino acid residues was obtained. No sequence homology to other known bacteriocins could be demonstrated. It also appeared that the two peptides themselves shared little or no sequence homology. The presence of soy oil did not affect the activity of leucocin H in agar.
TI  - Detection of Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin using a capture antibody ELISA.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (PLC), commonly known as alpha toxin, is  the lethal, dermonecrotic toxin produced by all strains and is considered a major virulence factor in clostridial myonecrosis. We developed a capture antibody ELISA that accurately and specifically quantitates alpha toxin produced by C. perfringens. Another PLC, derived from Bacillus cereus, and culture filtrates from various bacterial species including Clostridium bifermentans and Clostridium novyi were not cross-reactive in this ELISA. Standard curves generated with homogenous C. perfringens alpha toxin revealed detection limits of 19 ng/ml. The ELISA was more sensitive in detecting alpha toxin than techniques such as PLC enzymatic activity and mouse lethality assays.
TI  - [Microwave effect on survival of sporulated bacteria inoculated in minced meat].
AB  - Due to the current tendency of cooking and heating meat prepared foods in microwave ovens and the possibility that they transmit bacterial diseases, the survival rate of spore-forming bacteria was evaluated in minced meat samples. Meat was innoculated with a known number of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens spores, and laterly thawed and cooked in an Amana microwave oven (2450 Hz). Survival rate was determined according to the methodology described by Vanderzant & Splittstoesser, and the activity of the enzyme acid phosphatase was determined as cooking parameter. B. cereus spore showed a decrease in its number as the time of exposition increased, but without fully disappearing. C. perfringens spores also decreased in number, but showed a later increase, associated with the germination of survival spores.

TI  - Modulation of enzymatic activity and biological function of Listeria monocytogenes broad-range phospholipase C by amino acid substitutions and by replacement with the Bacillus cereus ortholog.
AB  - The secreted broad-range phosphatidylcholine (PC)-preferring phospholipase C (PC-PLC) of Listeria monocytogenes plays a role in the bacterium's ability to escape from phagosomes and spread from cell to cell. Based on comparisons with two orthologs, Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin and Bacillus cereus PLC (PLCBc), we generated PC-PLC mutants with altered enzymatic activities and substrate specificities and analyzed them for biological function in tissue culture and mouse models of infection. Two of the conserved active-site zinc-coordinating histidines were confirmed by single amino acid substitutions H69G and H118G, which resulted in proteins inactive in broth culture and unstable intracellularly. Substitutions D4E and H56Y remodeled the PC-PLC active site to more closely resemble the PLCBc active site, while a gene replacement resulted in L. monocytogenes secreting PLCBc. All of these mutants yielded similar amounts of active enzyme as wild-type PC-PLC both in broth culture and intracellularly. D4E increased activity on and specificity for PC, while H56Y and D4E H56Y showed higher activity on both PC and sphingomyelin, with reduced specificity for PC. As expected, PLCBc expressed by L. monocytogenes was highly specific for PC. During early intracellular growth in human epithelial cells, the D4E mutant and the PLCBc-expressing strain performed significantly better than the wild type, while the H56Y and D4E H56Y mutants showed a significant defect. In assays for cell-to-cell spread, the H56Y and D4E mutants had close to wild-type characteristics, while the spreading efficiency of PLCBc was significantly lower. These studies emphasize the species-specific features of PC-PLC important for growth in mammalian cells.

AB  - The microbiological quality of 1,012 hot meals served on aircraft was studied in  1991 to 1994. The material included dishes prepared in 33 countries all over the world. The geometric means of aerobic colony counts and Escherichia coli were significantly lower in breakfasts (P < 0.05) than in main dishes. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 30 samples (3.0%), Bacillus cereus being the most common pathogen. The frequencies of B. cereus and Staphylococcus aureus did not differ between breakfasts and main dishes. Many of the samples exceeded the minimum acceptable microbiological standards recommended by the Association of European Airlines (AEA) for E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella; i.e., 8.2%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. There were considerable differences in aerobic colony counts and E. coli counts between countries where the food was prepared.
TI  - Structure of the key toxin in gas gangrene.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin is the key virulence determinant in gas gangrene and has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of sudden death syndrome in young animals. The toxin is a 370-residue, zinc metalloenzyme that has phospholipase C activity, and can bind to membranes in the presence of calcium. The crystal structure of the enzyme reveals a two-domain protein. The N-terminal domain shows an anticipated structural similarity to Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC). The C-terminal domain shows a strong structural analogy to eukaryotic calcium-binding C2 domains. We believe this is the first example of such a domain in prokaryotes. This type of domain has been found to act as a phospholipid and/or calcium-binding domain in intracellular second messenger proteins and, interestingly, these pathways are perturbed in cells treated with alpha-toxin. Finally, a possible mechanism for alpha-toxin attack on membrane-packed phospholipid is described, which rationalizes its toxicity when compared to other, non-haemolytic, but homologous phospholipases C.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  - The authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the United States of America (USA) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. Cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the USA, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. The potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include Salmonella (with special attention to S. Typhimurium DT104), Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas spp. In conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Site-specific mutagenesis of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin: replacement of  Asp-56, Asp-130, or Glu-152 causes loss of enzymatic and hemolytic activities.
AB  - The current study has investigated the role of D-56, D-130, and E-152 in zinc ion binding properties, as well as the hemolytic, phospholipase C (PLC), and sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin, based upon crystallography studies of the Bacillus cereus PLC, which had suggested these residues might be important for these functional activities. The replacement of D-56 in alpha-toxin resulted in complete loss of hemolytic, PLC, and SMase activities. The variant toxins at D-130 showed an approximately 100-fold reduction of biological activities compared to that of the wild-type toxin. The substitution of glutamine or glycine for E-152 caused complete loss of these activities, but substitution of aspartic acid for E-152 reduced but did not completely inhibit these activities. The variant toxins at D-56 and D-130, as well as the wild-type toxin, possessed approximately 2 mol of zinc atoms per mol of the protein, but E152G and E152Q contained approximately 1 mol of zinc metal per mol of the protein. On the other hand, the zinc content in E152D was calculated as about 1.4 mol in the toxin molecule. The replacement of D-56, D-130, or E-152 had no effect on binding to sheep erythrocytes and uptake of free zinc ion from the solution. The variant toxins at D-130 showed partial antigenic identity with the wild-type toxin on a double gel diffusion test. These observations suggest that D-56 in alpha-toxin is required for catalytic activity of alpha-toxin, D-130 is essential for maintenance of structure, and the carboxyl group of E-152 tightly ligands one zinc ion, which is essential for catalytic activity of the toxin.
TI  - Neutralization of hemolytic and mouse lethal activities of C. perfringens alpha-toxin need simultaneous blockade of two epitopes by monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs 3B4, 1E8, 1F9) were produced by fusion of X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells and splenocytes of mice immunized with glutaraldehyde-inactivated alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens. All MAbs belonged to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class and possessed a kappa light chain. All the MAbs were specific for alpha-toxin of C. perfringens as demonstrated by immunoblotting experiments performed with culture supernatants of C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. sordellii, and Bacillus cereus. Competition analysis in an ELISA revealed that the MAbs recognized different epitopes on the alpha-toxin molecule. In an immunoblot assay based on a recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli, the binding site of MAb 1E8 but not those of MAbs 3B4 and 1 F9 were mapped to the COOH-terminal fragment of alpha-toxin (aa 248-370). To prove the neutralizing potential of the MAbs, alpha-toxin was preincubated with MAbs and subsequently tested for its lecithinase activity in an egg yolk diffusion turbidity (EYDT) assay, its hemolytic activity in a hemolysis test, and its lethal effect on mice after intraperitoneally administration. When the MAbs were tested individually, neutralization was only seen in the EYDT assay, where MAb 3B4 completely abolished the lecithinase activity of alpha toxin. However, when MAbs 3B4 and 1 E8 were used in combination, they acted synergistically and inhibited the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes in vitro. The same mixture of MAbs was also able to completely neutralize the lethal effect of three LD50 of alpha-toxin on Balb/c mice. Our results suggest that the alpha-toxin molecule contains several domains which are differently involved in the various activities of the toxin. We conclude that the hemolytic domain(s) of alpha-toxin is (are) identical with or very closely located to the domain(s) that cause the mouse lethal effect. The lecithinase activity may be involved in the mechanisms of hemolysis and mouse lethality but appears not to be the only determinant.
TI  - Rapid purification, partial characterization, and antimicrobial spectrum of the bacteriocin, Pediocin AcM, from Pediococcus acidilactici M.
AB  - The bacteriocin from Pediococcus acidilactici M, designated as Pediocin AcM, was  rapidly purified to homogeneity by the pH mediated cell adsorption-desorption method and semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC. The purification yield was 40.4% and the specific activity was increased by 2450-fold. It gave a single band and a single peak on SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis, respectively. When subjected to electrospray LC-MS analysis, the protein was found to be highly pure and the molecular weight was determined as 4,618 Da. High concentration of the bacteriocin (> 50 micrograms/ml) showed good resistance to extremes of pH (1-12) and temperature (121 degrees C). Pediocin AcM was deduced to be a monomer with an intra-peptide disulfide bond from the results of reversed-phase analytical HPLC analyses after reduction, oxidation and trypsin digestion. P. acidilactici M inhibited a large number of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus coagulans, B. cereus, and Aeromonas hydrophila.
TI  - Role of hemolytic and nonhemolytic phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for inflammatory mediator release from human granulocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa phospholipase C (PLC) is a critical component  in the pathogenesis of severe P. aeruginosa infections. However, P. aeruginosa can produce a hemolytic (PLC-H) as well as a nonhemolytic (PLC-N) variant, both having a MW of about 77 kD. In the past, studies did not distinguish between both types of PLC with regard to the induction of inflammatory mediators from human cells. METHODS: We compared the ability of P. aeruginosa PLC-H and PLC-N to generate leukotriene B4 (by HPLC) and oxygen (O2-) metabolites (luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence), and to release beta-glucuronidase and histamine (fluorophotometry from human granulocytes. Therefore, human neutrophilic granulocytes (PMN; 1 x 10(7)) or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (5 x 10(6)) were treated with purified P. aeruginosa PLC-H (up to 10 units) as well as culture supernatants (cutoff: MW > 50,000) of P. aeruginosa PAOl capable of producing both PLC-H and PLC-N, and PAOl mutant strains deficient in the production of either or both phospholipases. Controls were PLC-H from Clostridium perfringens and PLC-N from Bacillus cereus. RESULTS: PLC-H-containing P. aeruginosa culture supernatant, purified P. aeruginosa PLC-H as well as PLC-H from P. perfringens activated human leukocytes for a significant (p < 0.05) increase in inflammatory mediator release. In this regard, purified PLC-H (10 units) from P. aeruginosa activated human PMN for a significant increase in the generation of oxygen metabolites (30 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cpm) and in leukotriene B4 (6.1 +/- 2.0 ng), in the release of beta-glucuronidase (15.8 +/- 1.1%) and of histamine (25.8 +/- 6.2%) as compared to the corresponding control values (3 +/- 1 x 10(3) cpm; 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng; 5.1 +/- 1.0%, 5.1 +/- 1.5%). Culture supernatants containing no PLC or only PLC-N, as well as PLC-N from B. cereus, failed to activate or only slightly stimulated human granulocytes for inflammatory mediator release. CONCLUSION: The data thus provide evidence that P. aeruginosa PLC-H can be a potent inducer of inflammatory mediator release, at least in vitro. Our results therefore contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological role of P. aeruginosa PLCs.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies for use in detection of Bacillus and Clostridium spores.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies against bacterial spores of Bacillus cereus T and Clostridium sporogenes PA3679 were developed. Two antibodies (B48 and B183) were selected for their reactivity with B. cereus T spores, two (C33 and C225) were selected for their reactivity with C. sporogenes spores, and one (D89) was selected for its reactivity with both B. cereus and C sporogenes spores. The isotypes of the antibodies were determined to be immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) (B48), IgG1 (B183), and IgM (C33, C225, and D89). The antibodies reacted with spores of B. cereus T, Bacillus subtilis subsp. globigii, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus stearothermophilus, C. sporogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and Desulfotomaculum nigrificans. Antibody D89 also reacted with vegetative cells of B. cereus and C. sporogenes. Analysis of B. cereus spore extracts showed that two of the antigens with which the anti-Bacillus antibodies reacted had molecular masses of 76 kDa and approximately 250 kDa. Immunocytochemical localization indicated that antigens with which B48, B183, and D89 react are on the exosporium of the B. cereus T spore. Antibody D89 reacted with the exosporium and outer cortex of C. sporogenes spores in immunocytochemical localization studies but did not react with extracts of C. sporogenes or B. cereus spores in Western blotting. Some C. sporogenes antigens were not stable during long-term storage at -20 degrees C. Antibodies B48, B183, and D89 should prove to be useful tools for developing immunological methods for the detection of bacterial spores.
TI  - Intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. Toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. There are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. Heat labile toxins are produced by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by Escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. Similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the United States, and Yersenia enterocolitica. Protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. For example the Shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. Intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by Escherichia coli, and Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins are presented.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus plantarum UG1 isolated from dry sausage:  characterization, production and bactericidal action of plantaricin UG1.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum UG1 isolated from dry sausage produced an antimicrobial substance that inhibited other strains of the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, and some foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes. This antibacterial substance was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes and showed a bactericidal mode of action. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin, and was designated plantaricin UG1. This bacteriocin was stable in the pH range 4.5 to 7.0, partially inactivated by amylolytic enzymes and relatively thermostable. It was not affected by organic or lipolytic enzymes. Production of plantaricin UG1 was pH- and temperature-dependant and maximum yields were obtained in MRS broth cultures maintained at initial pH 6.5, and incubated at 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C, in the exponential to the early stationary growth phase of the producer organism. Ultrafiltration studies indicated that plantaricin UG1 has a molecular weight between 3 and 10 KDa. Curing experiments with L. plantarum UG1 resulted in the appearance of variants that lost bacteriocin production ability but were still immune to the bacteriocin. Plantaricin UG1 production appeared to be chromosomal encoded. Sensitive and insensitive Gram-positive bacteria adsorbed plantaricin UG1 irrespective of their susceptibility to it. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria did not adsorb plantaricin UG1. The bactericidal action of plantaricin UG1 did not depend on the physiological state of the indicator culture and did not cause cell lysis. The resistance of two indicator strains to plantaricin UG1 has been studied.
TI  - Use of site-directed mutagenesis to probe structure-function relationships of alpha-toxin from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The NH2-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens is highly homologous to the complete phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus (PC-PLC), for which a high-resolution crystal structure is available. This structural information was used as the basis of a site-directed mutagenesis strategy in which critical amino acid residues of alpha-toxin involved in zinc binding, interaction with substrate, or catalysis were replaced. Biochemical studies with the corresponding toxin variants indicate that there is probably a single active site endowed with lecithinase, sphingomyelinase, and hemolytic activities. By using a highly purified variant in which the catalytic aspartate residue at position 56 was replaced by asparagine, it was shown that phospholipase activity was essential for lethality in vivo and for mediating platelet aggregation in vitro.
TI  - Seasonal variations in the isolation of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens from environmental samples.
AB  - Calf carcasses contaminated with S. typhimurium, B. cereus and Cl. Perfringens were placed in either a decomposition pit or in a deep burial pit. Salmonella was isolated from the soil around the decomposition pit for 27 weeks and for 15 weeks around the burial site. Salmonella re-appeared in soil samples during cold winter weather after an apparent 9-week absence from the decomposition pit and after 68 weeks in the burial site (a total of 88 weeks after the start of the experiment). There was also an annual rise in the isolation rate of B. cereus from the soil during the colder winter months, but Cl. perfringens appeared to be more prevalent in samples taken during spring of the second year of the study. A similar apparent rise in the prevalence of S. enteritidis during a cold winter period occurred in an empty poultry house that had previously held a naturally infected broiler-breeder flock.
TI  - What problems does the food industry have with the spore-forming pathogens Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens?
AB  - Spore-forming bacteria are special problems for the food industry. It is not always possible to apply enough heat during food processing to kill spores, thus we have to take advantage of knowledge of the spore-formers to control them. For the meat industry Clostridium perfringens might become a special problem, although this bacterium mainly causes food poisoning through food served in restaurants, hospitals or homes for elderly people (Cliver, 1987; Reynolds, 1987; Gondrosen et al., 1990). The reason for the food poisoning is always the same: meat-containing dishes stored after cooking with insufficient cooling and reheating (Granum, 1990). Even though it should be relatively easy to control this kind of food poisoning, C. perfringens is still one of the most common sources of foodborne diseases. Proper disinfection is necessary to control this type of food poisoning, as it is now clear that only kitchen strains of C. perfringens are able to produce the large amounts of enterotoxin necessary to cause food poisoning (Granum, 1990; Cornillot et al., 1995). Bacillus cereus is more difficult to control, specifically in the dairy industry, where it is now causing the main problems. Insufficient heating of rice-containing dishes has been known to cause B. cereus food poisoning of the emetic kind for a long time (Kramer and Gilbert, 1989), but will not be dealt with in this paper. There are several reasons for the problems in the dairy industry. First of all it seems to be impossible to completely avoid the presence of B. cereus in all milk samples. Secondly the spores are very hydrophobic (Husmark, 1993), and will attach to the surfaces of the pipelines of the dairy industry, where they might multiply and resporulate. A third problem is that pasteurisation heating is insufficient to kill the spores, while competition from other vegetative bacteria is eliminated. It seems that several B. cereus strains have become psychrotrophic over the years, making possible growth at temperatures as low as 4-6 degrees C (Granum et al., 1993a). None of the methods used to control hygiene in the dairy industry so far are able to control B. cereus. This is a continuously increasing problem for the industry but, with emerging knowledge, we should be able to control it. In this paper we will discuss the problems the food industry is facing with C. perfringens and B. cereus, and how these problems might be solved. We will also give our view on how research might ease these problems in the future.
TI  - Probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - DNA-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. In this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of Salmonella, E. coli, V. cholerae, non-O1 Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and C. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. In food control, DNA-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of DNA-based methods. The most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.
TI  - Postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. Flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. The rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees C, ranged from 0.1 ng/mL/min for Streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/mL/min for Clostridium perfringens. The rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. pH had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. These data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Isolation, and virulence profiles, of Aeromonas hydrophila implicated in an outbreak of food poisoning in Sweden.
AB  - A case of food poisoning outbreak involving Aeromonas hydrophila is reported in this study. A group of 27 people consumed a typical Swedish food "landgang" which is a type of smorgasbord containing shrimps with mayonnaise, liver pate, ham, sausage, and legume salad which was purchased from a food store. Twenty-two of the 27 persons became ill within 20-34 hr of consumption of the food and reported the symptoms ranging from severe acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, fever and vomiting. One person also fainted. The symptoms lasted for a couple of days. Of the remaining 5 healthy persons who consumed the left-over food the next day, 2 became ill with similar symptoms. The bacteriological examination of left-over food samples resulted in the isolation of A. hydrophila from shrimps with mayonnaise, smoked sausage, liver pate and boiled ham. The total number of A. hydrophila in these foods were log 10(6) to log > 10(7) organisms per gram of food sample. A. hydrophila was however, not isolated from legume/mayonnaise salad samples. All the food samples tested showed low numbers of other expected food contaminating organisms such as coliforms at 37 C and 44 C, fecal streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, fungi and yeast etc., while Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not detected in the food samples. Investigations of the virulence profiles of the A. hydrophila isolates showed their capacity to produce beta-hemolysin, cytotoxins, cytotonic toxins, enterotoxins, and adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal (Henle 407) cells in culture.
TI  - The relationship between phospholipid content and Ca2+-ATPase activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
AB  - The relationship between the phospholipid composition of sarcoplasmic reticulum and the activity of the Ca2+, Mg2+-stimulated ATPase was analyzed by digestion of membrane phospholipids with phospholipase C and A2 enzymes of diverse specificity and by detergent extraction. Phospholipase C of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium welchii, that hydrolyze preferentially phosphatidylcholine (PC), inhibited the Ca2+-ATPase activity parallel with the depletion of phosphatidylcholine from the membrane. Phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus hydrolyzed in addition to PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS), causing complete inhibition of Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity. Digestion of sarcoplasmic reticulum with the phospholipase A2 of snake or bee venom produced similar effects. The phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipases of B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis caused less than 10% inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase, accompanied by the hydrolysis of more than 70% of the phosphatidylinositol content of the membrane, without significant change in PC, PE and PS content. The inhibition of ATPase activity by the C type phospholipases was nearly completely reversed by octaethyleneglycol dodecyl ether (C12E8). These experiments suggest that the full phospholipid content of native sarcoplasmic reticulum (congruent to 100 mol phospholipid per mol Ca2+-ATPase), is required for ATPase activity and there is no indication that PE, PS, and PI play a specific role in ATP hydrolysis. Extraction of sarcoplasmic reticulum phospholipids by detergents such as deoxycholate, cholate and C12E8 also caused proportional inhibition of ATPase activity with the decrease in phospholipid content; the parallel extraction of PC, PE and PI left the phospholipid composition largely unchanged during delipidation. These observations do not support the requirement for a 'lipid annulus' of congruent to 30 phospholipid molecules/Ca2+-ATPase as proposed by Hesketh et al. ((1976) Biochemistry 15, 4145-4151) or the specific interaction of phosphatidylethanolamine with the ATPase molecule proposed by Bick et al. ((1991) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 286, 346-352).

AB  - One hundred and eighteen samples of uncooked pork sausages were analysed bacteriologically. The total aerobic plate count ranged from 1.8 x 10(8) to 9.2 x 10(8) CFU/g in the samples. High mean counts of Staphylococci, Enterococci, Micrococci, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella and Coliforms were observed. Staphylococcus aureus were encountered with count range 2.8 x 10(6) CFU/g to 7.4 x 10(6) CFU/g. The viable count of Escherichia coli ranged from 2.0 x 10(5) to 4.3 x 10(5) CFU/g. Clostridium perfringens were detected in 66.9% of samples with a count ranging from 3.9 x 10(2) to 1.1 x 10(7) Cl. perfringens/g. None of 118 samples contained Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Biochemical and immunological properties of the C-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The C-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin (cpa247-370) of Clostridium perfringens  has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Antiserum raised against cpa247-370 reacted in an identical manner to anti-alpha-toxin serum when used to map epitopes in the C-terminal domain, suggesting that cpa247-370 was immunologically and structurally identical to this region in the alpha-toxin. The isolated cpa247-370 was devoid of sphingomyelinase activity or haemolytic activity and was not cytotoxic for mouse lymphocytes. Haemolytic activity was detected when cpa247-370 was tested with the N-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin (cpa1-249), confirming that cpa247-370 confers haemolytic properties on the phospholipase C activity of the alpha-toxin. Haemolytic activity was not detected if cpa247-370 was tested with the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C, nor if cpa1-249 and cpa247-370 were incubated sequentially with erythrocytes.
TI  - Freeze-dried mixed cultures as reference samples in quantitative and qualitative  microbiological examinations of food.
AB  - Two simulated food samples in the form of mixtures of bacteria, freeze-dried in small glass vials, were tested for their suitability as reference materials in food microbiology. Stability and homogeneity of the samples were assessed during a 1 year period when stored at 2-6 degrees C. Samples were examined for aerobic plate counts, coliform counts, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, enterococci, yeasts and salmonellas. The samples were homogeneous but the number of colony forming units of some organisms declined during the time period studied. The maximum rate of decline (0.8 log units per year) was observed for the coliforms. Precision estimates (reproducibility and repeatability) for the different testing methods used are given. When compared with these data, the rate of decline was considered to be of less importance.
TI  - Effect of various digestive enzymes on the interaction of Toxoplasma gondii with  macrophages.
AB  - The participation of resident, elicited, and activated macrophage surface components during internalization of tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii was analyzed using neuraminidase, phospholipase C, trypsin, protease, and hyaluronidase. Treatment of these macrophages with neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae, phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens, protease, and hyaluronidase prior to their interaction with parasites increased the penetration of host cells by T. gondii. Incubation of macrophages with trypsin significantly inhibited the uptake of parasites. Our findings confirm previous observations that treatment of the macrophages with cytochalasin D under conditions that completely block the typical phagocytic process partially inhibits infection of the cells by T. gondii. The results of simultaneous treatment of the macrophages with enzymes and cytochalasin D suggested that the observed enhancement of cell infection by treatment with neuraminidase and hyaluronidase was attributable to a classic phagocytic process, whereas that obtained using phospholipase resulted from active penetration.
TI  - Detection by in vitro amplification of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) gene from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus is described for the specific amplification of the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) gene of Clostridium perfringens. A set of primers selected for their high specificity could detect Cl. perfringens in stools with a detection limit of approximately 5 x 10(2) bacteria, after bi-amplification. A modified PCR without thermal steps was performed to rapidly amplify, with a yield of 60%, the DNA template. With this PCR method Cl. perfringens alpha-toxin gene could be detected within 2 h. The PCR method detected alpha-toxin positive Cl. perfringens but did not react with phospholipase C-producing Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cl. sordellii and Cl. bifermentans. The amplified PCR products were screened through ethidium bromide agarose gel electrophoresis or, in only 1 h, with the PhastSystem (Pharmacia). This PCR satisfies the criteria of specificity, sensitivity and rapidity required for a useful tool in epidemiology and for the diagnosis of the pathogen Cl. perfringens as it may be used directly on stool samples.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lecithinase operon of Listeria monocytogenes and possible role of lecithinase in cell-to-cell spread.
AB  - The lecithinase gene of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, plcB,  was identified in a 5,648-bp DNA fragment which expressed lecithinase activity when cloned into Escherichia coli. This fragment is located immediately downstream of the previously identified gene mpl (prtA). It contains five open reading frames, named actA, plcB, and ORFX, -Y, and -Z, which, together with mpl, form an operon, since a 5.7-kb-long transcript originates from a promoter located upstream of mpl (J. Mengaud, C. Geoffroy, and P. Cossart, Infect. Immun. 59:1043-1049, 1991). A second promoter was detected in front of actA which encodes a putative membrane protein containing a region of internal repeats. plcB encodes the lecithinase, a predicted 289-amino-acid protein homologous to the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipases C of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens (alpha-toxin). plcB mutants produce only small plaques on fibroblast monolayers, and an electron microscopic analysis of infected macrophages suggests that lecithinase is involved in the lysis of the two-membrane vacuoles that surround the bacteria after cell-to-cell spread. On the opposite DNA strand, downstream of the operon, three more open reading frames, ldh, ORFA, and ORFB, were found. The deduced amino acid sequence of the first one is homologous to lactate dehydrogenases. Low-stringency Southern hybridization experiments suggest that these three open reading frames lie outside of the L. monocytogenes virulence region: mpl and actA were specific for L. monocytogenes, sequences hybridizing to plcB were detected in L. ivanovii and L. seeligeri, and sequences hybridizing to ORFX, -Y, and -Z were found in L. innocua. In contrast to this, sequences hybridizing to ldh or ORFB were detected in all Listeria species (including the nonpathogenic ones).
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  are dependent on a domain homologous to that of an enzyme from the human arachidonic acid pathway.
AB  - The N-terminal domain of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin, homologous with the nontoxic phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus, was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to retain all of the phosphatidylcholine hydrolyzing activity of the alpha-toxin, but not the sphingomyelinase, hemolytic, or lethal activities. The C-terminal domain of alpha-toxin showed sequence and predicted structural homologies with the N-terminal region of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme from the human arachidonic acid pathway which plays a role in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases in humans.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - Secondary structure of sphingomyelinase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Of the total of 306 amino acids in the sequence of sphingomyelinase (SMPLC) from  Bacillus cereus, almost half (150) are expected to be involved in the formation of loop or turn structure, while 65 and 73 residues may participate in the formation of alpha-helix and beta-structure, respectively. The helix content of SMPLC was calculated to be 0-5%, based on the CD spectra. The addition of divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ or both Ca2+ and Mg2+ had no effect on the CD spectra of SMPLC, although the addition of these metal ions caused the breakdown of membranous SM and specific adsorption of SMPLC onto erythrocyte membranes. A hydropathy study showed that SMPLC has hydrophobic regions at the N-terminal domain which must be responsible for the binding of the enzyme to the membranes. The partial homologies between the amino acid sequences of SMPLC and Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) are discussed.
TI  - Sodium hypophosphite inhibition of the growth of selected gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Sodium hypophosphite (SHP) was evaluated for inhibition of growth of selected Gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria in Trypticase Soy Broth. In addition, the effects of pH and sodium chloride (NaCl) alone and in combination with (SHP) were also examined. All inhibition studies were performed with optimal or nearly optimal growth conditions for each bacterium. Growth was monitored by determining culture optical density at 600 nm, and a time to significant growth determined for each test media. Ratios of time to significant growth for each control over that in test variables were used to evaluate the effect of SHP and other variables on growth. SHP was effective in inhibiting growth of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum strains 62A 52A and Lamanna B, but generally ineffective against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Results from this investigation show that SHP has potential as a food ingredient for the inhibition of certain Gram-positive foodborne pathogens.
TI  - A medium for the isolation, enumeration and rapid presumptive identification of injured Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A blood-free egg yolk medium (BCP) containing pyruvate, inositol, mannitol and a  bromocresol purple indicator in a nutrient agar base has been developed to initiate the growth of Clostridium perfringens. It is comparable to blood agar for the growth of normal, chilled stored vegetative cells and heat-injured spores of Cl. perfringens and Bacillus cereus. It has the advantage over blood agar in exhibiting presumptive evidence of Cl. perfringens (production of lecithinase and inositol fermentation) after an overnight incubation at 43 degrees - 45 degrees C. Pyruvate, catalase and other hydrogen peroxide degraders were found to remove toxins rapidly formed in media exposed to air and light. Free radical scavengers of superoxide, hydroxyl ions and singlet oxygen were ineffective. Without scavengers the formation of 10-20 micrograms/ml hydrogen peroxide in the exposed medium was indicated and found lethal to injured Cl. perfringens. The BCP medium has been used successfully for the rapid identification and enumeration of Cl. perfringens in foods and faeces from food poisoning outbreaks and cases of suspected infectious diarrhoea. Greater recovery of severely injured vegetative Cl. perfrigens could be obtained by pre-incubation at 37 degrees C of inoculated media for 2-4 h followed by overnight incubation at 43 degrees - 45 degrees C. Tryptose-sulphite-cycloserine and Shahidi-Ferguson-perfringens agar base were found to inhibit the growth of several strains of injured vegetative Cl. perfringens. This was not completely overcome by the addition of pyruvate. The inclusion of mannitol also allows the medium to be used for the presumptive identification of B. cereus. Growth and lecithinase activity are profuse on BCP. Heat-injured spores are recovered equally well on BCP and blood agar. A scheme for the identification of some other clostridia on BCP is presented.
TI  - ACP Broadsheet 124: May 1990. Examination of faeces for bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Analytical methods for Bacillus cereus and other Bacillus species.
AB  - Bacillus cereus can give rise to two distinct forms of foodborne disease, the emetic and the diarrhoeal syndromes. The emetic syndrome is believed to be associated with an emetic toxin pre-formed in food. Cooked rice is the most common vehicle, and the symptoms are similar to those of Staphylococcus aureus intoxication. The diarrhoeal type is caused by an enterotoxin and the symptoms generally parallel those of the Clostridium perfringens food poisoning. The heat resistance of B. cereus spores and the non-fastidious nature of the organism facilitates its survival and/or growth in a wide variety of foods. This review describes analytical methods available for the isolation, identification, and enumeration of the organism, in addition to details about biological and immunological methods for toxin assay. Data are also presented concerning the incidence and epidemiology of B. cereus food poisoning around the world, and especially in Japan.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of on-farm manufactured goat cheese.
AB  - The bacteriological quality of 198 ripened soft or semi-soft goat cheeses obtained from dairy farms and the retail trade was investigated. The cheeses were examined for total counts of aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria (37 and 44 degrees C respectively), enterococci, coagulase positive staphylococci, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. Cheeses obtained from dairy-farms were also determined for pH value. In terms of all tests performed, cheeses made of heat-treated milk with starter culture had the best prospects for fulfilling the criteria for 'fit for consumption'. Cheeses made of raw milk without starter culture made up the most unsatisfactory group from a food-hygiene point of view. Bacteriological guidelines for on-farm manufactured goat cheese are suggested.
TI  - Preincubation time and the use of oxygen indicators in determining the microbiological quality of aseptically packed pea and tomato soup.
AB  - In order to get accurate information about the preincubation time needed for viscous aseptic products, the growth characteristics of three food poisoning organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus in pea soup, and one spoilage organism, Lactobacillus plantarum, in tomato soup, were followed during a preincubation period at 30 degrees C for 14 days. The sterile food packs were sealed into polyamidepolyethylene laminate bags containing different headspace gas concentrations (21% oxygen + 80% nitrogen, 5% oxygen + 95% nitrogen and 100% nitrogen). Bacterial growth was followed every second day by counting the number of colony forming units and following the headspace oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. The bacterial strains differed in their growth characteristics, especially in their ability to consume oxygen from the headspace, and also in their ability to produce carbon dioxide. The headspace oxygen concentration was also followed by oxygen indicators in order to determine the correlation with the oxygen concentration of the headspace and the growth of bacteria. The bacterial growth followed more closely the concentration of carbon dioxide than the concentration of oxygen. It was concluded that further studies are needed to determine the preincubation period for viscous aseptic products in order to furnish accurate data on the growth characteristics of low numbers of bacteria in aseptic foods at different headspace gas compositions.
TI  - Gene cloning shows the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens to contain both sphingomyelinase and lecithinase activities.
AB  - The plc gene encoding the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C), an important virulence factor of Clostridium perfringens, has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. Transcriptional analysis of mRNAs produced in vivo by C. perfringens and E. coli, and in vitro using purified RNA polymerase from C. perfringens revealed that plc is transcribed constitutively from a single promoter situated about 100 nucleotides from the coding sequence. A T7 expression system was used to overproduce alpha-toxin in E. coli; enzymological studies with the amplified plc gene product unambiguously demonstrated that both lecithinase (phospholipase C) and sphingomyelinase activities were associated with this 43,000 dalton cytotoxin. The 370-residue alpha-toxin is haemolytic and shares sequence and functional homology with the two components of Bacillus cereus haemolysin, cereolysin AB, in which phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase activities are associated with different polypeptides.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - Neutrophil oxidative metabolism after exposure to bacterial phospholipase C.
AB  - The effects of phospholipase C (PLC) from Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus on bovine neutrophil oxidative metabolism were studied by measuring superoxide production and oxygen consumption in response to PLC alone or in combination with other stimuli. PLC from both species elicited superoxide production and enhanced the response to stimulation by NaF when the two stimuli were given simultaneously. However, oxygen consumption in response to latex beads was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of cells with B. cereus PLC. The results suggest that some bacterial PLC exoenzymes may initially activate neutrophils but leave the cells relatively unresponsive to subsequent stimuli.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the glucose oxidase-glucose system on food-poisoning organisms.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of the glucose oxidase-glucose system was studied on food-poisoning organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella infantis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica using automated turbidometry. The bacteria were grown in sterile-filtered meat medium which was either raw or heat-denaturated. The results showed a clear growth inhibition with combinations of 0.5-1.0 mg/ml glucose and 0.5-1.0 IU/ml glucose oxidase. The growth inhibition was more effective in the heat-denaturated meat medium. The most resistant pathogens were Campylobacter jejuni and Listeria monocytogenes, however growth inhibition was still evident. The possible application of the glucose oxidase-glucose system in food products inhibiting the growth of pathogens and spoilage organisms is discussed.
TI  - [Comparison of the sporocidal effects of two different disinfectants i a model experiment with pathogenic and nonpathogenic clostridial spore as well as with Bacillus cereus].
AB  - Official methods concerning the examination of sporocidal effects of disinfectants are presently lacking in the Federal Republic of Germany. Spore resistance of selected clostridial species towards formaldehyde and peracetic acid was examined by suspension tests and germ-carrier tests in comparison to spores of Bacillus cereus. Formaldehyde in concentrations between 5% and 20% as well as peracetic acid in concentrations between .004% and .125% were tested. Spore concentration of 10(6) spores/ml in the suspension-tests and 10(4) spores/ml in the germ-carrier tests with wooden germ-carriers were used. Against formaldehyde spores of Cl. septicum had the lowest resistance in the suspension tests followed by Cl. difficile, Cl. tertium, Cl. bifermentans and Cl. perfringens. Cl. sporogenes strain NCTC 532 had the most resistant spores. Concerning peracetic acid the situation was nearly the same. The resistance of all spores of pathogenic species under investigation towards chemical disinfectants was covered by those of Cl. sporogenes NCTC 532 treated with isopropanol. Isopropanol treated spores of B. cereus offer an alternative solution for practical disinfectant testing because spore production as well as growth of clostridia entail great expense. In order to cover the resistance of spores of Cl. perfringens A, the most resistant pathogenic clostridial species tested here, increased spore concentrations of B. cereus would be necessary.
TI  - Phospholipase C and haemolytic activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  cloned in Escherichia coli: sequence and homology with a Bacillus cereus phospholipase C.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) gene (cpa) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The biological activities of the cloned gene product have been analysed and the complete nucleotide sequence of the cpa gene has been determined. The cloned cpa gene product, which is exported to the periplasm in E. coli, possesses both phospholipase C and haemolytic activities. Haemolysis is not apparent when cell extracts are incubated with isotonic suspensions of sheep erythrocytes, but can be detected and quantified readily when dilutions of the same extracts are placed in wells in sheep-blood agar plates. Like other sequenced clostridial genes, the cpa gene has a high AT content (66.4%), exhibits a strong bias for using codons with A or T in the wobble position, and the 350 base pairs upstream from the gene have a significantly higher AT content (79.5%) than the coding region. The cpa gene encodes a 398 amino acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular weight of 45,481 D. This is very similar to the estimated molecular weight (Mr) of the cpa primary gene product expressed in an in vitro transcription-translation system (Mr 46,000), but larger than the cpa gene product detected in E. coli minicells, E. coli whole cells or in C. perfringens cells (Mr 43,000), suggesting post-translational processing. The 28 N-terminal residues of the deduced alpha-toxin sequence possess the consensus features of a signal peptide and may be removed during secretion. The deduced alpha-toxin sequence shares significant structural homology with the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A fragment of DNA containing the gene coding for the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. By comparison of the gene sequence with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. The gene promoter showed considerable homology with the E. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene was expressed by E. coli. The cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. A 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the N terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase C and weaker homology with the phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Attachment of human placental-type alkaline phosphatase via phosphatidylinositol  to syncytiotrophoblast and tumour cell plasma membranes.
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol anchors human placental-type alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) to  both syncytiotrophoblast and tumour cell plasma membranes. PLAP activity was released from isolated human placental syncytiotrophoblast plasma membranes and the surface of tumour cells with a phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus. This was a specific event, not the result of proteolysis or membrane perturbation, but the action of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C in the preparation. Soluble PLAP, released with B. cereus phospholipase C and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, ran on SDS-PAGE as a 66-kDa band. This corresponded to intact PLAP molecules. The protease bromelain cleaved lower-molecular-mass PLAP (64 kDa) from the membranes. Flow cytometry demonstrated that B. cereus phospholipase C released human tumour cell membrane PLAP in preference to other cell-surface molecules. This was in contrast to the non-specific proteolytic action of bromelain or Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C, which had no effect on membrane PLAP expression. Radiolabelling of tumour cells with fatty acids indicated PLAP to be labelled with both [3H]myristic and [3H]palmitic acid. This fatty-acid--PLAP bond was sensitive to pH 10 hydroxylamine treatment indicating an O-ester linkage.
TI  - Release of proteins from the surface of bovine central nervous system myelin by salts and phospholipases.
AB  - Incubation of bovine CNS myelin with phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus under conditions that lead to extensive phospholipid degradation caused 10% of the myelin protein to be released from the membrane. The myelin basic protein (MBP) was a major component of the dissolved protein. Comparable incubations with phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus, or cabbage phospholipase D removed little MBP. However, concentrations of sodium chloride near 1 M and concentrations of divalent metal ions between 50 and 600 mM released typically 9-12% of the total myelin protein, with MBP again as the predominant component. Repetitive washing with calcium chloride solutions resulted in dissolution of over 90% of the MBP. When myelin was incubated in 1.0 M sodium chloride or 25 mM calcium chloride, the MBP was cleaved largely into two major peptides with apparent molecular weights near 14,000 and 12,000, but with 200 mM or higher concentrations of calcium chloride most of this protein remained intact. With appropriate manipulation of the ionic milieu, it is thus possible to remove most of this extrinsic protein from the myelin surface under relatively mild conditions. The conditions that release the protein suggest that it is held at the membrane surface by ionic interactions.
TI  - Egg yolk paste for determining some food poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Egg yolk, aseptically prepared from fresh eggs, was partially dehydrated with a 40% high fructose corn syrup solution, and 10% salt was added. This salted yolk paste was added to mannitol salt agar for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, to NaCl-glycine Kim and Goepfert medium for detection of Bacillus cereus, to Clostridium welchii agar for detection of C. perfringens, and to Gifu anaerobic medium for detection of C. botulinum. These food poisoning bacteria showed the same lecithovitellin (LV) reaction on these media as on the same media prepared with fresh egg yolk. The yolk paste could be stored at -20 C without freezing and did not show any bacterial growth after holding at 25 C for 30 days. The increased salt content resulted from the addition of salted yolk paste to the media did not inhibit the growth of the food poisoning bacteria used in these experiments. For the identification of the food poisoning bacteria used in this work, and which give a LV reaction, salted yolk paste is more convenient to use than yolk separated from fresh shell eggs.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Synthesis of a thiophosphate analog of dioctanoylphosphatidylcholine: a phospholipase C substrate.
AB  - Dioctanoylthiophosphatidylcholine, a racemic thiophosphate analog of L-alpha-dioctanoylphosphatidylcholine, has been synthesized and isolated by flash chromatography. In contrast with the didecanoylthiophosphatidylcholine synthesized previously, the analog is easily dispersed on sonication in aqueous media and is rapidly hydrolyzed to produce a free thiol group in the presence of the extracellular phospholipase C from either Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens. When 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitro-benzoic acid) was included as a thiol reactive chromogenic agent, the resultant measurement of product release, as an increase in absorbance at 412 nm, showed a linear relationship with added enzyme.
TI  - [Effect of components of curing mixtures on the antagonistic properties of enterococci and other bacteria isolated from cured meat].
AB  - Effect of sodium chloride, glucose, sodium glutamate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitraite, ascorbic acid, sodium citrate, polyphosphates (Hamine) on antagonistic activity of enterococci and various bacteria isolated from cured meat against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi-murium, Salmonella cholerae-suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium botulinum type A, Clostridium botulinum type B, Clostridium botulinum type E, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium perfringens type A, Clostridium sporogenes. It was found that some of the chemical compounds examined increased the antagonistic effect and other compounds partly or totally inhibited it. Sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, glucose, and ascorbic acid in majority of cases increased antagonism and sodium citrate and polyphosphates restrained this phenomenon.
TI  - Release of the 120 kDa component of the mouse neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM from cell surfaces by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.
AB  - To study the membrane anchoring of the 120 kDa component of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM, the smallest form lacking a transmembrane domain, cultured mouse neural cells were treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus. When live cultures of astrocytes and neurons are treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, N-CAM120 is released into the supernatant. Under these conditions N-CAM140 and N-CAM180 are not released. Phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens does not release N-CAM120. The embryonic form of N-CAM on astrocytes migrating as a broad band between 120 and 180 kDa is also partially released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C as a band migrating between 120 and 160 kDa. These observations suggest novel mechanisms in regulation of N-CAM120 expression on the cell surface and in modulation of N-CAM-mediated cell adhesion.
TI  - Effects of phospholipases C on the beta-receptor-adenylate cyclase system of chick erythrocyte membranes.
AB  - The beta-adrenergic receptor located in chick erythrocyte membranes was characterized using (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) with rapid filtration techniques. The affinity of beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-)-propranolol, was approximately 100-fold higher than that of (+)-propranolol. Catecholamines were bound with the receptor in the following order, (-)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-norepinephrine greater than (-)-epinephrine, suggested the binding site to be beta 1-classification. When the membrane preparation was treated with phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PCase) of Clostridium perfringens or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIase) of Bacillus thuringiensis, [3H]-DHA binding was decreased to the level of 66 or 86% of the control, respectively. The treatment with sphingomyelinase C (SMase) of Bacillus cereus, however, did not cause any appreciable reduction of [3H]-DHA binding. Throughout these experiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]-DHA was not influenced by phospholipases C. The affinity of isoproterenol for beta-receptor was decreased in the absence of GTP, but not altered in the presence of GTP by PIase action. Treatment with PCase or SMase, however, did not affect the affinity of isoproterenol for beta-receptor. Treatment with PIase inhibited basal, isoproterenol-stimulated and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. On the other hand, PCase treatment inhibited only isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, but not basal and forskolin-stimulated activities. These results suggest that membrane phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), are directly related to the receptor binding and that PI interacts with adenylate cyclase activity.
TI  - Effect of phospholipase C on high-molecular-mass alkaline phosphatase in serum.
AB  - Electrophoresis of some serum samples on polyacrylamide gel, followed by staining for alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), produces a band of activity at the gel origin. This high-Mr band consists of liver membrane fragments containing alkaline phosphatase and other enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase is closely associated with phosphatidylinositol in liver plasma membranes, and we have found that phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3) from Bacillus cereus, known to possess some phosphatidylinositol specificity, was able to release liver alkaline phosphatase from the high-Mr band. Two preparations of phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens, however, which has no phosphatidylinositol specificity, had no effect on the alkaline phosphatase activity in the high-Mr band.
TI  - Lethal effect of butylated hydroxyanisole as related to bacterial fatty acid composition.
AB  - Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas fragi, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella "anatum" were challenged with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Susceptibility was measured as the concentration of BHA required to cause a 90% reduction in bacterial survivors. Staphylococcus aureus LP and P. fragi were two of the most resistant species examined; C. perfringens and P. fluorescens were the most susceptible. Gram stain reaction was found not to be a strict indicator of bacterial susceptibility to BHA. There was no obvious relationship between individual fatty acids and susceptibility. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the total lipid fraction of only the gram-positive species was related to susceptibility. The ratios of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of other fractions were not related to susceptibility.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of goat's milk. A Public Health Laboratory Service survey.
AB  - In a 12-month survey (June 1982-May 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. The statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. Surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees C and by 76% at 22 degrees C. There were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 Escherichia coli per ml in 91%. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. Only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. The methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. No sample was Brucella ring-test-positive. Experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored goat's milk showed that Bacillus cereus, Staph. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees C. Clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while Campylobacter jejuni did not grow. The results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.

TI  - Inhibition of phospholipases by Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Leu-Ile-Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-His-Phe,  C terminus of middle-sized tumor antigen.
AB  - The N and C terminals and tyrosine-phosphorylating site of the middle-sized tumor antigen of polyoma virus were chemically synthesized. The sequences of these peptides were Met-Asp-Arg-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg-Ala-Asp-Lys (N-MT), Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Leu-Ile-Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-His-Phe (C-MT), and Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Met-Pro-Met-Glu (MT-Tyr), respectively. Among these peptides, the C-MT peptide inhibited phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4), phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3), and phospholipase D (EC 3.1.4.4). In addition, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.10) was also inhibited by this peptide. To study the mechanism of the inhibition, kinetic analysis was performed using phospholipase A2 from porcine pancreas. The degree of inhibition of phospholipase was dose dependent, and maximal inhibition was observed at pH 8.8. This peptide inhibited phospholipase A2 in a competitive manner for low-affinity sites of Ca2+, and in a noncompetitive manner for phospholipid substrates. When a fatty acid in the 2 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine was replaced by palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3), or arachidonic acid (C20:4), the degree of inhibition of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by the C-MT peptide decreased. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 by the C-MT peptide was reversed by low concentrations of sodium deoxycholate but not by Triton X-100 or Nonidet P40, nonionic detergents. These detergents and the modification of acyl groups altered the micellar state of phospholipids. These results, taken together, suggest that the binding of the C-MT peptide near the low-affinity Ca2+ binding sites modifies the interaction of phospholipid substrates with the active center of phospholipase A2.
TI  - Evidence for the role of calcium and diacylglycerol as dual second messengers in  thyrotropin-releasing hormone action: involvement of diacylglycerol.
AB  - TRH stimulates the secretion of PRL by clonal GH3 pituitary cells. The studies of the accompanying paper have shown that the secretory response during the first 30-60 min is biphasic (phase I, 0-3 min; phase II, 5-60 min) and that the phase I response may be mediated through mechanisms involving Ca+2 translocation. In previous studies, it has been shown that TRH treatment rapidly induces the breakdown of inositol phospholipids with accompanying diacylglycerol accumulation. In this paper, we present evidence for a possible role for diacylglycerol as a second messenger which mediates the phase II response to TRH. A role for lipid-dependent mechanisms in regulating PRL secretion in GH3 cells was supported by the finding that phospholipase C, phorbol esters, melittin, and exogenous diacylglycerols were effective secretagogues in GH3 cells. Secretion promoted by these agents was found to be persistent, as was the phase II response to TRH. For three of the agents examined (TRH, phorbol esters, and phospholipase C), stimulated PRL release was found to be nonadditive, suggesting the presence of some common element in the pathways by which these agents exert their effects. This lipid-linked pathway of activation was distinguished from a cAMP-mediated pathway.

TI  - Steroidogenic effect of exogenous phospholipase C on bovine adrenal fasciculata cells.
AB  - Phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus) added to the incubation medium stimulated the steroidogenic activity of bovine adrenal zona fasciculata cell suspensions to a level similar to that induced by optimal concentration of ACTH. This effect was not related to an increase of cyclic AMP; it was calcium-dependent and was also induced by an other bacterial phospholipase C (from Clostridium perfringens) whereas phospholipases A2 and D were ineffective. Phospholipid metabolism was examined in these cells after radiolabeling with [14C]-glycerol or [32P]orthophosphate. Phospholipase C induced a very fast (5 seconds) increase in cellular [14C]-1,2-diacylglycerol followed by [32P] labeling of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol. These events preceded the stimulation of steroidogenesis which was detectable after 2 minutes of incubation. These observations suggest that activation of an endogenous phospholipase C activity may be considered as an early event in the response of bovine adrenocortical cells to steroidogenic effectors such as angiotensin II and acetylcholine.
TI  - Comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  - It is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. Although the effect of most of these toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. The resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. The biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. The duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. Subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. The heat-labile toxins of V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella spp., A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. Similarly the heat-stable toxins of E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. Classified along with the enterotoxin of C. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by Sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of E. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. In another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by Staph. aureus until more is known. Surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological and structural differences. Evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. The structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. It is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like V. cholerae.
TI  - Structural studies of Fc receptors. V. Effect of phospholipase C treatment on the binding activities of the Fc receptor of macrophage or its isolated plasma membrane.
AB  - The effect of phospholipase C treatment on the binding activity of the Fc receptor of guinea pig macrophage was studied to analyze the interaction of the Fc receptor with membrane phospholipids necessary for the activity. It was confirmed by subcellular fractionation that the receptor is localized on the plasma membrane. Treatment of the whole cell or isolated plasma membrane with phospholipase C of Clostridium perfringens diminished the binding of soluble IgG2-immune complex to Fc receptors on the cell or membrane. On the other hand, phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus did not affect the activity when it acted on the whole cell but it did diminish the activity when it acted on the isolated plasma membrane. Analysis of the phospholipids of untreated and treated macrophages or plasma membrane showed that phosphatidylcholine molecules, particularly those located in the membrane (not accessible to attack from the cell surface by phospholipase C of B. cereus), appear to be crucial for efficient interaction of macrophage Fc receptors with immune complex. Ligand-binding experiments with macrophages showed that the diminished binding activity was due to a decrease of the avidity for immune complex, but did not seem to be due to a decrease in the number or affinity of Fc receptors for monomeric IgG2. Taken together with the previous results which demonstrated that Fc receptors which had apparently lost the activity due to delipidation could be reconstituted with phosphatidylcholine but not with most other phospholipids, the results seem to indicate that the diminution of the binding activity to the immune complex of macrophage or its plasma membrane caused by phospholipase C treatment is due to the impairment of multivalent interaction between Fc receptor molecules on the membrane and IgG2 molecules in the immune complex, probably as a result of the loss of interaction of the head groups of phospholipids with Fc receptor molecules and the change in membrane properties resulting from the increase of diglycerides.

TI  - Bacillus cereus-induced myonecrosis.
AB  - A patient with an incomplete amputation due to a crush injury to his arm developed a myonecrosis with Gram-positive rods noted on muscle and wound aspirates. The patient was treated for a probable Clostridium perfringens infection but culture results proved the organism to be Bacillus cereus. In light of the reported resistance of Bacillus cereus to penicillin, this case serves to emphasize the importance of expanded empiric coverage with high-dose penicillin and an aminoglycoside pending the return of culture and sensitivity results.
TI  - The microbiology of selected retail food products with an evaluation of viable counting methods.
AB  - In an inter-laboratory survey, the pour plate, surface spread, agar droplet and spiral plate methods were used in parallel with the surface drop method for enumeration of micro-organisms in foods. Good agreement was obtained between all surface methods of enumeration, but there was poor agreement between molten agar methods and the surface drop method. A total of 1143 samples of food that were ready for consumption at the point of retail sale were examined. Eight types of food products were chosen: meat pasties, sausage rolls, real-cream slices, synthetic-cream slices, mayonnaise-based coleslaws, faggots, pates and continental sausages. The results of this survey suggest that the upper limit for an acceptable viable count should vary according to the food product. Salmonellae were not isolated on any occasion. Potentially harmful organisms were not isolated at levels expected to constitute a public health hazard. Information concerning the nature of the product, the total viable count, the presence or absence of pathogenic, toxigenic or indicator organisms, the spectrum of the bacterial flora and the relative predominance of each organism must all be considered when assessing the microbiological acceptability of retail 'ready to eat' products.
TI  - [Microbiological study of spices. I. Oregano].
AB  - A total of 150 oregano samples from 6 different trade marks were studied. These samples were obtained at retail shops in Buenos Aires city and they were analyzed in order to determine the presence of the following microorganisms: 1) mesophilic aerobic plate count; 2) molds; 3) coliforms and fecal coliforms; 4) enterococci; 5) aerobes sporeforming: a) mesophilic aerobes; a1) total aerobes; a2) mesophilic anaerobes; b) thermophilic; b1) sulfide spoilage sporeformers; b2) total aerobes; b3) thermo-philic Flat sour; 6) pathogens; 6a) Clostridium perfringens 6b) Bacillus cereus and 6c) Staphylococcus aureus. We can conclude from these results that there is no apparent risk for public health. Nevertheless the microbiologic evaluation of the spices becomes important when they are added to packed foodstuff which has not received a minimum thermic treatment.
TI  - Freeze-dried mixed cultures as samples for proficiency tests and collaborative studies in food microbiology.
AB  - A method is presented for preparing samples of freeze-dried mixtures of microorganisms for proficiency tests and collaborative studies. The samples may include most microorganisms that are found in routine analysis in food laboratories. Transport of samples during 48 h did not decrease the number of microorganisms, nor was the variability among samples significantly affected by transport. The standard deviation of counts after 5 weeks of storage varied from 0.04 (Staphylococcus aureus) to 0.17 (Clostridium perfringens) log unit. Storage of samples for 10 weeks decreased the number of viable organisms by 0.02-0.43 log unit. Variability among samples increased for Providencia alcalifaciens and Bacillus cereus after 10 weeks of storage. No significant increase was found for the other organisms.
TI  - Effects of phospholipase C on the Na+-Ca2+ exchange and Ca2+ permeability of cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles.
AB  - We have examined the effects of phospholipase C pretreatment on Ca2+ transport in highly purified canine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. Na+-Ca2+ exchange, measured as Nai+-dependent Ca2+ uptake, is stimulated when 10-70% of the membrane phospholipid has been hydrolyzed. Although the phospholipase C treatment also increases sarcolemmal passive Ca2+ flux, the membrane maintains a sufficient permeability barrier for enhanced transport (via Na+-Ca2+ exchange) to be observed. These effects can be obtained with phospholipase C from either Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus cereus. We find that the phospholipase C (C. perfringens) preferentially hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin leaving the negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, intact. This suggests that the presence of negatively charged phospholipids is sufficient to ensure Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. Thin section electron microscopy reveals gross morphological changes in phospholipase C-treated sarcolemma. The vesicles are aggregated and diacylglycerol droplets are visible. Fusion occurs such that adjacent vesicles share a common bilayer. It is surprising that vesicles displaying severe structural damage can demonstrate enhanced transport activity.
TI  - Phospholipids chiral at phosphorus. Preparation and spectral properties of chiral thiophospholipids.
AB  - The thiophospholipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphocholine (DPPsC) was  shown to be a mixture of two diastereomers by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. The isomer that resonates at the lower field in CDCl3 (56.12 ppm) was designated as isomer A and the other (resonates at 56.07 ppm) as isomer B. Phospholipase A2 from four different sources (bee venom, Naja naja venom, Crotalus adamanteus venom, and porcine pancreas) was shown to hydrolyze the isomer B of DPPsC specifically, whereas phospholipase C from two different sources (Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens) hydrolyzes isomer A specifically. So that the two diastereomers could be separated, DPPsC(A + B) was first digested with phospholipase A2 to give 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphocholine (MPPsC) (which is designated as isomer B of MPPsC) and the unreacted DPPsC(A). Reacylation of MPPsC(B) gave pure DPPsC(B). The properties of DPPsC(A) and DPPsC(B) were investigated by 31P, 13C, 1H, and 14N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 1H and 13C NMR showed that both isomers in methanol solution have conformational properties similar to those of the natural phospholipid, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. On the other hand, the two isomers A and B showed small but significant differences in the chemical shifts of the carbon in the chiral carbon center and the phosphorus in the chiral phosphorus center.
TI  - Increase in osmotic fragility of bovine erythrocytes induced by bacterial phospholipases C.
AB  - Bovine erythrocytes were treated with each of three bacterial phospholipases C; phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PCase) of Clostridium perfringens, sphingomyelinase C (SMase) of Bacillus cereus and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIase) of Bacillus thuringiensis. An increase in osmotic fragility was detected by means of a coil planet centrifugation (CPC) apparatus (Biomedical Systems Co., Tokyo) after the treatment with these enzymes. The peak of hemolysis normally observed in the untreated erythrocytes at the range between 50 and 100 mOsM shifted to 160 to 200 mOsM with the progress of sphingomyelin hydrolysis by phospholipase C of C. perfringens. Sphingomyelinase C of B. cereus showed two different effects on bovine erythrocytes: In the absence of divalent cations or in the presence of Ca2+ alone, the peak of hemolysis shifted to the region from 130 to 160 mOsM, without appreciable hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, while in the presence of Mg2+ or Mg2+ plus Ca2+, the peak of hemolysis further shifted to the region from 160 to 200 mOsM with the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. Abrupt shift in osmotic fragility to a much higher region around 250 mOsM was produced by treatment with increasing amounts of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. In this case, a significant amount of acetylcholinesterase was released from the erythrocyte membrane without hot or hot-cold hemolysis. The mechanism of alteration of osmotic fragility of bovine erythrocytes by treatment with phospholipases C seems to differ from case to case, depending upon the specific action of each enzyme toward the membrane phospholipids.
TI  - Induction of ornithine decarboxylase by treatment of guinea pig lymphocytes with  phospholipase C.
AB  - Treatment of guinea pig lymphocytes with Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C  but not with Naja naja snake venom phospholipase A2 increased ornithine decarboxylase activity. The increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity was suppressed by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, suggesting that de novo syntheses of RNA and protein are necessary for the increase in the enzyme activity. These results suggest that the activation of phospholipase C rather than that of phospholipase A2 is responsible for induction of ornithine decarboxylase during lymphocyte transformation.
TI  - [Relations between food poisoning and ascariasis].
AB  - During the examination of faeces for the causative agents of food poisoning, the  search was also extended to the occurrence of worm eggs. Ascaris lumbricoides eggs occurred six times more frequently in persons affected with food poisoning than in consumers who were not harmed by the intake of poisoned food. This relationship was observed in non-specific cases of food poisoning and in those of unknown aetiology, whereas it was less pronounced in cases of specific poisoning. This difference has not been confirmed for Trichuris trichiura. It is safe to say that Ascaris infection increases the disposition to manifestation of symptoms of intoxication and represents, among other things, a factor in the aetiology of food poisoning.
TI  - Survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  - Lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). Structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. Cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of Trypan Blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. The membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded Trypan Blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. Among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the Aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. Thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. Furthermore, the use of Trypan Blue uptake as a measure of cell death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.
TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - Wet and dry bacterial spore densities determined by buoyant sedimentation.
AB  - The wet densities of various types of dormant bacterial spores and reference particles were determined by centrifugal buoyant sedimentation in density gradient solutions of three commercial media of high chemical density. With Metrizamide or Renografin, the wet density values for the spores and permeable Sephadex beads were higher than those obtained by a reference direct mass method, and some spore populations were separated into several density bands. With Percoll, all of the wet density values were about the same as those obtained by the direct mass method, and only single density bands resulted. The differences were due to the partial permeation of Metrizamide and Renografin, but not Percoll, into the spores and the permeable Sephadex beads. Consequently, the wet density of the entire spore was accurately represented only by the values obtained with the Percoll gradient and the direct mass method. The dry densities of the spores and particles were determined by gravity buoyant sedimentation in a gradient of two organic solvents, one of high and the other of low chemical density. All of the dry density values obtained by this method were about the same as those obtained by the direct mass method.
TI  - Studies on (K+ + H+)-ATPase. IV. Effects of phospholipase C treatment.
AB  - (1) The total phospholipid content of a gradient purified (K+ + H+)-ATPase preparation from pig gastric mucosa is 105 mumol per 100 mg protein, and consists of 29% sphingomyelin, 29% phosphatidylcholine, 28% phosphatidylethanolamine, 10% phosphatidylserine and 4% phosphatidylinositol. The cholesterol content corresponds to 50 mumol per 100 mg protein. (2) Treatment with phospholipase C (from Clostridium welchii and Bacillus cereus) results in an immediate decrease of the phosphate content. Up to 50% of the phospholipids are hydrolyzed by each phospholipase C preparation alone, without further hydrolysis by increased phospholipase concentration or prolonged incubation time. Combined treatment with the two phospholipase C preparations, sequentially or simultaneously, hydrolyzes up to 65% of the phospholipids. (3) The (K+ + H+)-ATPase and K+ stimulated p-nitrophenylphosphatase activities are decreased proportionally with the total phospholipid content, indicating that these enzyme activities are dependent on phospholipids. (4) Phospholipase C treatment does not change optimal pH, Km value for ATP and temperature dependence of the gastric (K+ + H+)-ATPase, but slightly decreases the Ka value for K+. (5) Phospholipase C treatment lowers the AdoPP[NH]P binding and phosphorylation capacities, suggesting that inactivation occurs primarily on the substrate binding level. (6) Most of the results can be understood by assuming that hydrolysis of the phospholipids by phospholipase C leads to aggregation of the membrane protein molecules and complete inactivation of the aggregated ATPase molecules.
TI  - Enzymatic hydrolysis by bacterial phospolipases C and D of immobilized radioactive sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine.
AB  - An assay system for phospholipases C has been described with sphingomyelin immobilized to octyl-Sepharose CL-4B as substrate. The immobilization procedure was further developed and used with [14 C-choline]-sphingomyelin and [14C-choline] phosphatidylcholine (lecithin). These immobilized radioactive phospholipids made the enzymatic assays easier to perform and made it possible to increase the sensitivity. Furthermore, since release of the choline part instead of the phosphate part of the substrate molecule was measured, it was possible to use this assay for phospholipase D as well. The enzyme characteristics of phospholipase D from Corynebacterium ovis were compared in this test system with those of three phospholipases C (from Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) with respect to hydrolysing capacities and optimal ion concentrations.
TI  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of immobilized sphingomyelin by three bacterial phospholipases C.
AB  - Through hydrophobic interaction, sphingomyelin was adsorbed to agarose beads containing octyl groups by a stepwise dilution procedure. This immobilized lipid was used as a substrate for three bacterial phospholipases C (E.C. 3.1.4.3.). The degradation with time of this substrate showed two different fractions of the substrate according to hydrolysing velocity in the early part of the time-curve when phospholipases C from Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens were used. The early fractions could be predigested by the enzymes, a procedure which resulted in linear time-curves. The corresponding early part of the time-curve for phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus was linear, indicating a comparatively large early fraction of the substrate for this enzyme. The stock gel of the immobilized lipid substrate could be stored for months. It was easily and reproducibly handled as a water suspension. After enzymatic hydrolysis the substrate was rapidly separated from enzyme and product by filtration. The enzyme assay presented thus represents a convenient way to avoid the difficulties connected with the use of temporary sonicated suspensions as substrate for bacterial phospholipases C.
TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Inclusion of NaCl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Salmonella senftenberg, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, C. perfringens (two strains). The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.

TI  - Behavior of pathogenic bacteria in the oyster, Crassostrea commercialis, during depuration, re-laying, and storage.
AB  - Oysters (Crassostrea commercials) harvested from major cultivation areas within the state of New South Wales, Australia, were commonly contaminated with low levels of the food-poisoning organisms Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Salmonella was found in oysters on only one occasion. These bacteria were cleansed from oysters during oyster purification by re-laying in a non-polluted waterway. Oysters were laboratory contaminated to levels in excess 1,000 cells per g with either B. cereus, C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus, Salmonella typhimurium, or S. senftenberg. These species were cleansed from such oysters during purification in a laboratory depuration unit that used ultraviolet light for sterilizing the depuration water. Escherichia coli was also cleansed from oysters under the same re-laying or depuration conditions so that its measurement alone could be used to indicate the cleansing of the above pathogenic species. The levels of these bacteria were also measured during the storage of oysters under conditions that occur during marketing. While B. cereus counts remained relatively stable during storage, the Salmonella spp. gradually decreased in numbers and C. perfringens rapidly died off. V. parahaemolyticus counts increased slightly during the first 4 days of storage, after which decreases occurred.
TI  - Commercial milk products and indigenous weaning foods in a rural West African Environment: a bacteriological perspective.
AB  - Two commercially available baby milks, one 'biologically acidified', the other 'non-acidified', and a traditional weaning food, millet gruel, were prepared and stored under village conditions in West Africa. Increases in total colony count and in number of Bacillus cereus, Clostridium welchii, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were determined in these products when stored as commonly practised at ambient temperatures over a period of 8 h. Poor hygiene during preparation was indicated by readily detectable numbers of coliforms and E. coli in freshly prepared samples of each of the milks, though the cooked local gruel seemed less vulnerable in this respect. The rate of increase in the numbers of these organisms was lower in the acidified milk when prepared with unboiled water containing high numbers of coliforms and E. coli. Increases in total colony count and in numbers of Staph. aureus were also less marked in the acidified milk. When food was not eaten soon after preparation the problem of bacterial overgrowth was as great with the local gruel as with the considerably more nutritious reconstituted milks.

TI  - Synthesis of choline and ethanolamine phospholipids with thiophosphoester bonds as substrates for phospholipase C.
AB  - Spectrophotometric assays of esterases are sensitive, rapid, and quite specific when thioester substrates are used. Glycerophospholipids with thiophosphoester bonds may be useful as substrates for phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3). These have been made from mercaptoglycerol and mercaptoethanol. The thiols were oxidized to disulfides, acylated, and reduced with dithiothreitol. Phosphocholine derivatives were made by the classical methods for oxyphosphoesters. The phosphatidyl choline analogue was converted to the phosphatidyl ethanolamine analogue by transphosphatidylation with cabbage phospholipase D and ethanolamine. Structures were proved with enzymic hydrolysis, infrared spectra, TLC behavior, and elemental analyses. The synthesized compounds were rac-1-S-phosphocholine-2,3-O-didecanoyl-1-mercapto-2,3-propanediol, 1-S-phosphoethanolamine-2,3-O-didecanoyl-1-mercapto-2,3-propanediol, and 1-S-phosphocholine-2-O-hexadecanoyl-1-mercapto-2-ethanol.
TI  - The effect of transition metal ions on the resistance of bacterial spores to hydrogen peroxide and to heat.
AB  - The presence of 10 microM-Cu2+ increased the lethal effect of hydrogen peroxide on spores of Clostridium bifermentans but not on those of Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus or Bacillus subtilis var. niger. Cu2+ at 100 muM also increased the lethal effect of heat on spores of C. bifermentans but not on those of B. sutilis var. niger. The rate and extent of Cu2+ uptake by spores of C. bifermentans and B. subtilis var. niger were similar, but examination of unstained sections of spores by electron microscopy suggested that Cu2+ is bound by the protoplasts of spores of C. bifermentans but not of B. subtilis var. niger.
TI  - Effect of purified phospholipases on the binding of tetrodotoxin to axon plasma membrane.
AB  - The role of phospholipids in the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to garfish olfactory nerve axon plasma membrane was studied by the use of purified phospholipases. Treatment of the membranes with low concentrations of either phospholipase A2 (Crotalus adamanteus and Naja naja) or phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens) resulted in a marked reduction in tetrodotoxin binding activity. A 90% reduction in the activity occurred with about 45% hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, and with phospholipase C the lipid hydrolysis was about 60--70% for a 70--80% reduction in the binding activity. Phospholipase C from B. cereus and Cl. perfringens had similar inhibitory effects. Bovine serum albumin protected the tetrodotoxin binding activity of the membrane from the inhibitory effect of phospholipase A2 but not from that of phospholipase C. In the presence of albumin about 25% of the membrane phospholipids remained unhydrolyzed by phospholipase A2. It is suggested that these unhydrolyzed phospholipids are in a physical state different from the rest of the membrane phospholipids and that these include the phospholipids which are directly related to the tetrodotoxin binding component. It is concluded that phospholipids form an integral part of the tetrodotoxin binding component of the axon membrane and that the phospholipase-caused inhibition of the binding activity is due to effects resulting from alteration of the phospholipid components.
TI  - The variable response of bacteria to excess ferric iron in host tissues.
AB  - The enhancement by exogenous ferric iron, both systemic and local, of the infectivity of 120 strains of bacteria, representing 17 genera, was measured in the skin of guinea-pigs. Systemic iron enhanced only 23% of 115 strains, and local iron 49% of 71 strains. Systemic iron, by an apparently anti-inflammatory action, depressed the size of lesions produced by 27 of the non-enhanced strains from nine of the genera tested. For most strains, the degree of enhancement was small, ranging from 2- to 8-fold, and often evident only with the more effective local iron; among these were some near-saprophytes like Mycobacterium phlei, M. smegmatis, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium bifermentans. Substantial enhancement, from 14- to 50-fold, was observed with the more pathogenic among the strains tested: namely BCG, Corynebacterium ovis, C. murium, Listeria monocytogenes, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Cl. perfringens, Cl. septicum, Cl. oedematiens, and some strains of Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. The enhancement of BCG by a single dose of iron given locally with the inoculum was only feebly manifest after 7 days, but substantial after 14--19 days, indicating the decisive effect of interference with an early humoral defence on the establishment of chronic infection some time later. Insofar as guinea-pigs whose antibacterial defences are lowered by substantial amounts of exogenous iron in the circulation represent human subjects at risk of infection because of clinical states characterised by excess of available iron, the results of the survey suggest that only a minority among the environmental bacteria can take advantage of the decreased resistance associated with such states; but that this minority is likely to include the more virulent strains in the environment.
TI  - Foodborne hazards of microbial origin.
AB  - Foods can serve as vehicles of many pathogenic and toxigenic agents of disease. Bacterial agents comprise three groups: 1) those that grow in the food and produce an active toxin before consumption (e.g., clostridium botulinium); 2) those that merely exist as contaminants in the food but are able to initiate infection when swallowed (e.g., Salmonella spp.); and 3) those that multiply and produce large numbers of vegetative cells in the food, then release an active enterotoxin when they sporulate in the gut. A few parasitic (e.g., Trichinella spiralis) and viral agents (e.g., hepatitis A) also can be transmitted by food. Botulinum poisoning is the deadliest foodborne disease. The potential danger of botulism from cured meats is a major factor in the argument over use of nitrites as meat curing agents. A new disease called infant botulism has been recognized since 1976. Apparently it is not foodborne but results from intraintestinal growth of C. botulinum in very young infants. Salmonellosis is the most important of the foodborne diseases from the standpoint of overall human health. The primary vehicles are contaminated raw meat, poultry, and eggs. Faulty food handling practices are responsible for most food poisoning in the United States.

TI  - Tissue sterility in uneviscerated carcasses.
AB  - Sheep muscle tissue removed aseptically from control carcasses, from uneviscerated carcasses held at 20 degrees C for 24 h, and from carcasses of sheep subjected to stress before slaughter was examined for the presence of bacteria. All samples from a total of 68 carcasses were sterile. Whole-body autoradiography of mouse carcasses showed that 14C-labeled fixed bacteria injected after death remained in the lumen of the intestine. Live bacteria did not penetrate the mucosal surface until the tissue structure had been disrupted by proteolytic enzymes. Bacteria were unable to penetrate sections of intestine longitudinally until considerable structural breakdown had occurred, indicating that blood and lymph vessels do not normally offer a pathway for microbial invasion from the intestine. Clostridia, which have been reported to be responsible for deep spoilage of meat, reached maximum numbers 24 to 28 h after death in the intestines of guinea pig carcasses stored at 20 degrees C, but did not invade carcass tissues until the stomach ruptured as a result of proteolysis between 2 and 3 days after death.

AB  - 1-Benzhydryl -4- (5-nitro-2-furfurylideneamino) piperazine and 11 substituted analogs were prepared and examined for in vitro antimicrobial activity. The compounds were active against Bacillus cereus 7, Bacillus megaterium 122, Bacillus subtilis 104, Clostridium perfringens 13, and the tetracycline-resistant Clostridium perfringens 37. Regression analyses on the antibacterial activity data based on the Hansch approach, using pi, pi2, and sigma parameters, yielded several statistically significant correlation equations. 1-Benzhydryl-4-(5-nitro-2-furfurylideneamino) piperazine stopped the protein and DNA syntheses in C. perfringens 13, as indicated by precipitable radioactivity. The compound, however, showed no effect on the cell wall synthesis in the bacteria.
TI  - Phospholipid dependence of UDP-glucuronyltransferase.
AB  - Very extensive hydrolysis of phospholipids with pure Bacillus cereus phospholipase C at 5 degrees C greatly inhibited the maximum demonstrable rate of glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol by UDPglucuronyltransferase in guinea pig liver microsomes. Lysophosphatidylcholine restored much of the inhibited activity but non-phospholipid surfactants or hydrolysis of diglycerides failed to reactivate. Phospholipid depletion likewise inhibited o-aminophenol glucuronidation and phospholipids restored activity. It is concluded that glucuronyltransferase specifically requires phospholipids for optimal activity. It seems unlikely that these phospholipids only serve to dissolve aglycones, or that they are direct physiological regulators of the transferase. Instead, a permissive role is ascribed to phospholipids, allowing glucuronyltransferase to be regulated by other means.

TI  - Hydrolytic action of phospholipases on bacterial membranes.
AB  - Substrate specificities of phospholipases C[EC 3.1.4.3] from Clostridium novyi, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aureofaciens were studied under the same conditions. Phospholipases C from Clostridium novyi and Bacillus cereus show wide substrate specificities while those of Clostridium perfringens and Pseudomonas aureofaciens show relatively narrow specificities. On the basis of these results, the hydrolytic actions of these phospholipases on membrane lipids of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium novyi were examined under the same conditions. The enzymes of Clostridium novyi and Bacillus cereus attacked all the membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, and o-aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol. Phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aureofaciens attacked these three membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine. Phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hardly attacked the phospholipids of these bacterial membranes. However, phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hydrolyzed phosphatidylethanolamine in a mixture containing lipid extract from Escherichia coli membrane and purified phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk.
TI  - Theta-toxin of Clostridium perfringens. I. Purification and some properties.
AB  - Theta-Toxin, an oxygen-labile hemolysin produced by Clostridium perfringens, was  purified 3300 fold from culture filtrate by successive chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and Sephadex G-150. The purified toxin gave two distinct bands in disc electrophoresis, while the same material, after mild reduction with dithiothreitol, yielded a single band, indicating that the purified theta-toxin contained, as well as a reduced, active form, an oxidized, inactive form of toxin. These two forms of the toxin had a similar, if not identical molecular size. The purified preparation gave a single band in a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and formed a single precipitin line with National Standard gas gangrene (C. perfringens) antitoxin. By sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of theta-toxin was estimated to be 51 000, the value being in exact accordance with that obtained by amino acid analysis. The amino acid composition of theta-toxin was very close to that of cereolysin, an oxygen-labile hemolysin produced by Bacillus cereus. The amino-terminal residue of theta-toxin was lysine as determined by the Dansyl method.

Clostridium perfringens (C. welchii) serotype 68, which was isolated from many of the patients and the deceased but not from the food, may also have been responsible. Food kept warm during distribution can produce an ideal environment for bacterial multiplication and similar outbreaks may occur again.

AB  - Selective hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine species, which are selectively radioactively labelled in vivo, does not appear to interfere with a radiochemical assay for hydrolysis of microsomal phosphatidylcholine by C-type phospholipases from Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens. Both phospholipases substantially hydrolysed phosphatidylcholine over the pH range 4.0-10.0.
TI  - Gonadotropin receptors in plasma membranes of bovine corpus luteum. I. Effect of  phospholipases on the binding of 125I-choriogonadotropin by membrane-associated and solubilized receptors.
AB  - The ability of bovine corpus luteum plasma membranes to bind 125I-choriogonadotropin has been examined after prior treatment of the membranes with phospholipases A, C, and D. Treatment of the purified membranes with low concentrations of phospholipases A and C resulted in the inhibition of the binding of 125I-choriogonadotropin to its receptors, whereas phospholipase D had no effect. Receptor activity was decreased by low concentrations of phospholipase A from either bee venom, Vipera russelli or Crotalus terrificus terrificus. Similarly, low concentrations of phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium welchii also inhibited the binding activity while comparatively higher concentrations of phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus were required to achieve comparable inhibition. The time required to produce 50% inhibition of in vitro binding by phospholipases A and C was found to be 6 and 23 min, respectively. Upon either removal or chelation of calcium ions by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) both enzymes were completely inhibited as evidenced by the complete retention of the membrane binding activity. The decrease in the specific binding of choriogonadotropin to membranes after phospholipase digestion resulted in a decrease in the number of binding sites and was not accompanied by a change in the affinity of the hormone-receptor complex. The rates of association and dissociation of the 125I-choriogonadotropin-receptor complex and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) were nearly identical in untreated and phospholipase-treated membranes. Phospholipases did not have any effect on the preformed hormone-receptor complex or on solubilized receptor. Filtration through Sepharose 6B of solubilized 125I-choriogonadotropin-receptor complex from untreated membranes or membranes which had been pretreated with phospholipase C prior to carrying out hormone binding did not alter the profile (Kav 0.38). Gel filtration of membranes treated with phospholipase A showed two peaks of bound radioactivity with distribution coefficients (Kav) of 0.08 and 0.35, respectively.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of foodborne diseases.
AB  - Many bacterial species are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne intoxication and infection. The foodborne diseases are classified on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved into four categories: performed toxin, enterotoxin formed in the colonized small intestine, mucosal invasion (enterocolitis) and mucosal invasion with bacteremia. Invasive and toxigenic strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are discussed. In vivo test systems for the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms and tissue culture assays for the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli are described. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of foodborne diseases of major public health interest are reviewed - botulism, staphylococcal intoxication, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, salmonellosis, enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and Bacillus cereus enteritis. The role of the laboratory in the epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of foodborne diseases is emphasized.
TI  - The effect of phospholipase C on human blood platelets.
AB  - The effect of phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3) on human blood platelets has been studied. Phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus was purified to homogeneity as judged by analytical and sodium dodecyl sulphate disc gel electrophoresis and by immunoelectrophoresis. Human platelets isolated from platelet-rich plasma by gel filtration or by centrifugation and washing were incubated with phospholipase C. A loss of 20-45% of the total platelet phospholipid was observed, whereas 88% was hydrolyzed when platelet homogenates were submitted to identical enzyme treatment. Intact platelets lost 50-75% phosphatidylethanolamine, 20-50% phosphatidylcholine, and 20-25% phosphatidylserine. Sphingomyelin was not a substrate for the enzyme under the conditions used. The platelets contained no detectable endogenous phospholipase C activity. The loss of phospholipid was not accompanied by aggregation of the platelets, nor did the platelets lose their ability to aggregate with ADP or thrombin. Total platelet factor 3 releasable by freezing and thawing was reduced. Measurements of releasable platelet factor 4 and the efflux of serotonin showed that no release reaction was triggered even when up to 45% of the total phospholipid in the platelets was hydrolyzed. When sphingomyelinase was added together with, before, or after phospholipase C, aggregation occurred. Sphingomyelinase alone gave no aggregation. The gel-filtered platelets also aggregated upon addition of purified phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens. The distribution of phospholipids in the platelet membrane is discussed.
TI  - Effect of delayed evisceration on the microbial quality of meat.
AB  - The postomortem invasion of muscle and other tissues by bacteria from the intestinal tract was studied with the use of radioactive tracers. The injection of 14C-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14C throughout carcasses. When live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, it was not possible to isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. It appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. It therefore seems that a delay of up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 C remained sterile.
TI  - [Normal status of Bac. cereus and Cl. perfringens in the body of healthy slaughter animals].
AB  - Studied were cattle, pigs, sheep, and young calves intended for slaughter. The experiments were carried out under productional conditions, strictly observing the routinely adopted practice of preslaughter handling. The blood of the animals was sampled prior to slaughter. Samples from the meat (musculature), spleen, kidneys, liver, mesenterial and body lymph nodes as well as feces were taken immediately after slaughter. It was established that Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens were almost lacking in the musculature, mesenterial and body lymph nodes and in some of the parenchymal organs. These organisms were chiefly found in the intestinal tract. Eighty-three up to 100 per cent of the isolated cultures of Cl. perfringens and from 62.5 up to 100 per cent of the isolated cultures of Bac. cereus originated from the feces.

TI  - Organization of phospholipids in human red cell membranes as detected by the action of various purified phospholipases.
AB  - 1. The action of eight purified phospholipases on intact human erythrocytes has been investigated. Four enzymes, e.g. phospholipases A2 from pancreas and Crotalus adamanteus, phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus, and phospholipase D from cabbage produce neither haemolysis nor hydrolysis of phospholipids in intact cells. On the other hand, both phospholipases A2 from bee venom and Naja naja cause a non-haemolytic breakdown of more than 50% of the lecithin, while sphingomyelinase C from Staphylococcus aureus is able to produce a non-lytic degradation of more than 80% of the sphingomyelin. 2. Phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii appeared to be the only lipolytic enzyme tested, which produces haemolysis of human erythrocytes. Evidence is presented that the unique properties of the enzyme itself, rather than possible contaminations in the purified preparation, are responsible for the observed haemolytic effect. 3. With non-sealed ghosts, all phospholipases produce essentially complete breakdown of those phospholipids which can be considered as proper substrates for the enzymes involved. 4. Due to its absolute requirement for Ca2+, pancreatic phospholipase A2 can be trapped inside resealed ghosts in the presence of EDTA, without producing phospholipid breakdown during the resealing procedure. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ stimulates phospholipase A2 activity at the inside of the resealed cell, eventually leading to lysis. Before lysis occurs, however, 25% of the lecithin, half of the phosphatidylethanolamine and some 65% of the phosphatidylserine can be hydrolysed. This observation is explained in relation to an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in red cell membranes.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium botulinum by strains of Clostridium perfringens isolated from soil.
AB  - Thirty-one soil samples were examined for the presence of organisms capable of inhibiting growth and toxin production of strains of Clostridium botulinum type A. Such organisms were found in eight samples of soil. Inhibiting strains of C. perfringens were found in five samples, of C. sporogenes in three and of Bacillus cereus in three. Three of the C. perfringens strains produced an inhibitor effective on all 11 strains of C. botulinum type A against which they were tested, seven of eight proteolytic type B strains, one nonproteolytic type B strain, five of nine type E strains and all seven type F strains, whether proteolytic or nonproteolytic. They did not inhibit any of 26 type C strains, 6 type D strains, 4 type E strains, or 24 C. sporogenes strains. In mixed culture, an inhibitor strain of C. perfringens repressed growth and toxin production by a C. botulinum type A strain even though it was outnumbered by the latter about 40 times. It also repressed growth and toxin production of C. botulinum in mixed culture of soils in which this latter organism naturally occurred when cooked meat medium but not when trypticase medium was used.

TI  - Phospholipase C catalyzed formation of sphinogomyelin--14C from lecithin and N-(-14C)-oleoyl-sphingosine.
AB  - Commercial preparations of Clostreidium perfringens were incubated with phosphatidyl choline and N-1-(-14C) oleoylsphingosine. A radioactive product was formed which cochromatogramed with spingomyelin standard in three different solvent systems. Several other phospholipases and phosphatases were unable to catalyze this reaction. Neither choline, phosphoryl choline, cytidine diphosphate choline nor p-nitrophenyl phosphoryl choline were acitve donors. Sphingomyelin was only slightly active as a phosphoryl choline donor.
TI  - Inhibition of glucose 6-phosphatase by pure and impure C-type phospholipases. Reactivation by phospholipid dispersions and protection by serum albumin.
AB  - 1. Pure or impure C-type phospholipases hydrolysed rat liver microsomal phosphatides in situ at 5 degrees or 37 degrees C. At 5 degrees C mean hydrolysis of total phospholipids was 90% by Bacillus cereus and 75% by Clostridium perfringens (Clostridium welchii) C-type phospholipases. 2. Four degrees of inhibition of glucose 6-phosphatase (D-glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase; EC 3.1.3.9) resulted. (a) At 37 degrees C inhibition was virtually complete and apparently irreversible. (b) At 5 degrees C phospholipase C inhibited 50-87% of the activity expressed by intact control microsomal fractions. (c) Bovine serum albumin present during delipidation alleviated most of this inhibition: at 5 degrees C phospholipase C plus bovine serum albumin inhibited by 0-35% (mean 18%):simultaneous stimulation by the destruction of its latency seems to offset glucose 6-phosphatase inhibition, sometimes completely. (d) If latency was first destroyed, phospholipase C plus bovine serum albumin inhibited 30-50% of total glucose 6-phosphatase activity at 5 degrees C. Only this inhibition is likely largely to reflect the lower availability of phospholipids, essential for maximal enzyme activity, as it is virtually completely reversed by added phospholipid dispersions. Co-dispersions of phosphatidylserine plus phosphatidylcholine (1:1, w/w) were especially effective but Triton X-100 was unable effectively to restore activity. 3. Considerable glucose 6-phosphatase activity survived 240min of treatment with phospholipase C at 5 degrees C, but in the absence of substrate or at physiological glucose 6-phosphate concentrations the delipidated enzyme was completely inactivated within 10min at 37 degrees C. However, 80mM-glucose 6-phosphate stabilized it and phospholipid dispersions substantially restored thermal stability. 4. It is concluded that glucose 6-phosphatase is at least partly phospholipid-dependent, and complete dependence is not excluded. For reasons discussed it is impossible yet to be certain which phospholipid class(es) the enzyme requires for activity.
TI  - Changes in phosoholipid susceptibility toward phospholipases induced by ATP depletion in avian and amphibian erythrocyte membranes.
AB  - About half of the sphingomyelin content of fresh and ATP-depleted chicken erythrocytes is hydrolysed by sphingomyelinase. Removal of spingomyelin exposes the rest of the membrane phospholipids to hydrolysis by phospholipase C only in ATP-depleted but not in fresh cells. Addition of both sphinogomyelinase and phospholipase C to ATP-depleted cells causes about 60-70 percent hydrolysis of the total phospholipids accompanied by extensive (90 percent) hemolysis. The phospholipids of toad erythrocytes are partially available to phospholipase C activity in fresh cells (17-25 percent hydrolysis) without prior sphingomyelinase treatment. However, in ATP-depleted toad cells phospholipase C hydrolyses 66 percent of phospholipids and causes extensive lysis. Treatment of either fresh or ATP-depleted toad erythrocytes by sphingomyelinase together with phospholipase C induces hydrolysis of most of the phospholipds with complete lysis. Restoration of ATP to ATP-depleted cells endows them with resistance to the attack of phospholipase C. The correlation between changes in ATP level and membrane organization as revealed by increased susceptibility toward phospholipases is discussed.

TI  - Variation of type-B DNA x-ray fiber diagrams with base composition.
AB  - Eight natural DNAs of widely differing base composition have been studied by x-ray diffraction in fibers at high relative humidity. The resulting type B diffraction diagrams showed that all of the DNAs had a 34-A pitch and 3.4-A interbase pair separation. However, the intensity distribution on the inner three layer lines was a strong function of the base content. In diffraction diagrams of very AT-rich DNA, the intensity of the first and third layer line was 2- or 3-times stronger than in the patterns of GC-rich DNA. These high humidity diffraction patterns agree with x-ray scattering from solutions of DNA. The results are interpreted to imply that each AT base pair may have a different cross section than a GC pair. If this is so, it would appreciably alter the currently held ideas concerning DNA recognition.

TI  - Lysis of Escherichia coli by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and phospholipases as measured by beta-galactosidase activity.
AB  - A permeaseless mutant of Escherichia coli, which produces beta-galactosidase constitutively, was treated briefly with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and then with the phospholipases of Bacillus cereus. Cell lysis occurred, as indicated by an increase in beta-galactosidase activity and a decrease in absorbancy of the cell suspension. The susceptibility of the cells to attack by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and the phospholipases was markedly affected by the age of the cells when harvested. The results suggest that permeability changes may be associated with the activity of a phospholipase that specifically degrades phosphatidyl ethanolamine. A sonic-treatment method for determining the total beta-galactosidase content of E. coli cells, which is independent of their age when harvested, is described.
TI  - Lethal toxin of Bacillus cereus. I. Relationships and nature of toxin, hemolysin, and phospholipase.
AB  - Bacillus cereus phospholipase was characterized as a phospholipase C by the analysis of lecithin degradation products by thin-layer and paper chromatography. Methanol in the growth menstruum inhibited completely the synthesis of phospholipase C, whereas the synthesis of lethal toxin and hemolysin were only partially inhibited. Dialysis of preformed B. cereus products against ethyl alcohol and methanol did not inactivate hemolytic, phospholipase C, or lethal activity. The hemolytic and lethal activities of culture filtrates were completely abolished by trypsin, but phospholipase C activity was resistant to inactivation. Lethal and phospholipase C properties of culture filtrates were resistant to inactivation at 45 C, whereas the hemolytic activity was completely destroyed. Lethal, hemolytic, and phospholipase C activities appeared simultaneously in a complex growth menstruum, but the kinetics of synthesis were different in all cases. Resolution of B. cereus filtrates on columns of Sephadex showed that the phospholipase C, hemolysin, and lethal toxin are distinct proteins. Evidence is also presented which suggests a correlation between the synthesis of B. cereus toxin and the period of transition from vegetative growth to sporulation. The activity of each B. cereus product was cation-independent, as opposed to cation-dependency of the phospholipase C and lethal activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Immunological cross-reactivity between the B. cereus products and C. perfringens alpha-toxin was not apparent; indeed, they were shown to be antigenically distinct.

Bacteriol. 86:1084-1097. 1963.-Soluble antigens of 42 strains, representing nine species of clostridia commonly occurring in human infections, were prepared by growing the organisms in a nonantigenic medium. Serological studies demonstrated the occurrence of considerable strain variation within each species. Interactions among the nine species, as well as with the previously characterized Clostridium perfringens, were also investigated. Extreme heterogeneity was observed among the species studied, with many cross-reactions due to common antigens, although species-specific antigens were also found in some cases. Occasional weak reactions were also demonstrated between certain clostridial antisera and the soluble antigens of three of the four species of Bacillus studied.

The nucleotidases were found to be very active in Proteus vulgaris, in which organism they were studied in detail. The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.
