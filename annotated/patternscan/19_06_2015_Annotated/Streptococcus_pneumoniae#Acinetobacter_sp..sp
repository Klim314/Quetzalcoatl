TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == prevalence of uropathogens in diabetic patients and their corresponding resistance pattern: results of a survey conducted at diagnostic centers in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  == objectives: urinary tract infection is the second most common clinical indication for empirical antibiotic treatment in primary and secondary health care settings. the incidence of diabetes mellitus throughout the world is increasing strikingly  and in the long run, it has some major effects on the genitourinary system which  makes diabetic patients more liable to urinary tract infection. this study is designed to reveal the distribution of uropathogens in diabetic patients according to age and sex, and corresponding resistance patterns. methods: a six-month retrospective review of urine culture assay data from august 2009 to january 2010 from randomly selected 85 patients who suffered from both urinary tract infection and diabetes was conducted. relevant information was retrieved and analyzed statistically using microsoft(r) excel 2002 software. results: the study showed that females are more vulnerable to pathogenic attack than males throughout a wide age distribution. in terms of pathogenic distribution, escherichia coli was the highest followed by streptococcus sp., acinetobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae and few others. though meropenem showed no resistance with  e. coli, acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae, in the case of streptococcus sp. it exhibited resistance of 25%. amikacin exhibited only 3% resistance with e. coli, whereas no resistance with acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae, and most interestingly showed 75% resistance with streptococcus sp. gentamicin exhibited no resistance with acinetobacter while 26.9%, 50% and 87.5% resistance  with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus sp. respectively. hence, nitrofurantoin exhibited less resistance 11.9% compared to 12.5% resistance with  e. coli and streptococcus sp. nitrofurantoin was highly prone to resistance with  acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%, 50% respectively). cephalosporins  (cephradine, cefixime, ceftriaxone, cefepime etc.) showed moderate resistance (avg. 50%), whereas amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest resistance in all these cases. conclusion: pathogens are mostly resistant to antibiotics including amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin, with few exceptions including gentamicin, amikacin and meropenem.

TI  == rational design of a plasmid origin that replicates efficiently in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: most plasmids replicate only within a particular genus or family. methodology/principal findings: here we describe an engineered high copy number expression vector, pbav1k-t5, that produces varying quantities of active reporter proteins in escherichia coli, acinetobacter baylyi adp1, agrobacterium tumefaciens, (all gram-negative), streptococcus pneumoniae, leifsonia shinshuensis, peanibacillus sp. s18-36 and bacillus subtilis (gram-positive). conclusions/significance: our results demonstrate the efficiency of pbav1k-t5 replication in different bacterial species, thereby facilitating the study of proteins that don't fold well in e. coli and pathogens not amenable to existing genetic tools.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == role of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == eighty per cent of the cases of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd) have an infective aetiology, atypical bacteria including mycoplasma pneumoniae accounting for 5-10 % of these. however, the importance of association of m. pneumoniae with episodes of aecopd still remains  doubtful. the present study was therefore undertaken to delineate the extent of involvement of m. pneumoniae in patients with aecopd at a referral hospital in delhi, india. sputum samples and throat swabs from a total of 100 aecopd patients attending the clinical research center of vallabhbhai patel chest institute, delhi, were collected during a 2-year period (january 2004-june 2006). the samples were investigated for the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens and m.  pneumoniae. diagnosis of infection with m. pneumoniae was based on culture, serology, direct detection of m. pneumoniae specific antigen and pcr. bacterial aetiology could be established in 16 of the 100 samples studied. pseudomonas spp. were recovered from eight cases, streptococcus pneumoniae from four and klebsiella spp. from two cases. acinetobacter sp. and moraxella catarrhalis were  isolated from one case each. serological evidence of m. pneumoniae infection and/or detection of m. pneumoniae specific antigen were seen in 16 % of the cases. one case with definite evidence of m. pneumoniae infection also had coinfection with pseudomonas spp. however, no direct evidence of m. pneumoniae infection was found in our study population as defined by culture isolation or pcr. in conclusion, although the serological prevalence of m. pneumoniae infection in our study population was significantly higher than in the control group, there was no direct evidence of it playing a role in aecopd.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == employment of broad-range 16s rrna pcr to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) method for the rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. methods and results: blood samples from  40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16s rrna pcr in conjunction with page and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific pcr employing abi taqman technology for n. meningitidis. analysis of clinical specimens employing 16s rrna pcr yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial dna. species-specific pcr yielded  30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for n. meningitidis. prior to separation  by page, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16s rrna pcr amplicons. following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for n. meningitidis and three specimens positive for acinetobacter sp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. one specimen was positive for both n. meningitidis and streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for n. meningitidis and pseudomonas sp., by broad-range pcr. seven clinical specimens were negative for n. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. conclusions: clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant dna. this study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant dna. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16s rrna pcr amplicons using a combination of page and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16s rrna pcr.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == [a comparative study of antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin against clinical isolates].
AB  == ceftibuten is an orally active third generation new cephalosporin. its antibacterial activity in vitro was tested to many clinical isolates and was compared to the activity of ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin, by twofold serial dilution method in muller-hinton agar--detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and by the disc-diffusion method of kirby-bauer. the new cephalosporin demonstrated great activity against the different clinical important strains. many resistant strains to ampicillin were high susceptible to  ceftibuten. the majority of gram-negative organisms, including enterobacteriaceae, the respiratory pathogens m.(b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae are highly susceptible to ceftibuten, however pseudomonas, acinetobacter are resistant. the majority of methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus are resistant too. new cephallosporin was also active against s. pyogenes (streptococcus gr. a) and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, but was inactive against s. agalactiae (streptococcus gr. b), s. pneumoniae penicillin-resistant strains and enterococci, similar to the other cephalosporins. the activity of ceftibuten was higher than that of ampicillin and cefuroxime against beta-lactamases positive strains of h. influenzae and m.(b) catarrhalis, also against tested strains of enterobacteriaceae. the major priority of the new antibacterial agent over other cephalosporins and ampicillin  is its stability to hydrolysis by the main broad-spectrum beta-lactamases producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae sp.

TI  == comb, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. bd413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  == here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging orfs in acinetobacter sp.  bd413, namely lytb, orfy, orfx, comb, and orfz, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comc. the n-termini of the deduced proteins orfy and comb exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein comb is similar to type iv pilins. lytb is similar  to the escherichia coli lytb, which has been implicated in the stringent response. no homologues of orfx, orfy and orfz could be identified. a mutation in orfy or orfz led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comb resulted in a non-competent phenotype. disruption of lytb did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comb is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfy and orfz mutants were due to polar effects on comb and comc, respectively. analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comb mutant suggested that the competence gene comb is not essential for the biogenesis of type iv pili and expression of the type iv pili-associated property of twitching motility. transcriptional fusions between comb and a promoter-free lacz gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comb during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.

TI  == identification and characterization of come and comf, two novel pilin-like competence factors involved in natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. strain bd413.
AB  == although the high level of competence for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 has been the subject of numerous studies, only two competence genes, comc and comp, have been identified to date. by chromosomal walking analysis we found two overlapping open reading frames, designated come and comf,  starting 61 bp downstream of comc. come and comf are expressed as stable proteins in escherichia coli, thus proving that they are indeed coding regions, but expression was successful only with 5'-deleted genes. come and comf are similar to pilins and pilin-like components. both genes were mutated, and the phenotypes  of the mutants were analyzed. natural transformation in comf mutants is 1,000-fold reduced, whereas come mutants exhibit 10-fold-reduced transformation frequencies. this is clear evidence that come and comf are involved in natural transformation. however, come and comf are specific for dna translocation, since  come and comf defects affected neither piliation nor lipase secretion. these results suggest that the type iv pili, the general protein secretion pathway, and the dna translocation machinery in acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 are evolutionary related but functionally distinct systems.

TI  == [the role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  == carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, enterococcus faecium  and streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them  such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia. imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem  requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme  inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. in abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (wsbl), cases of meningitis by pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. the carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. in the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care  units. the appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli,  producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class i chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.

AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.
