TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus partially alleviates tma-induced atopic dermatitis in mice through improving intestinal microbiota.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (lcr35) on atopic dermatitis (ad)-like symptoms in mice.  methods and results: ad-like skin lesions in balb/c mice were induced by sensitization and subsequent repeated challenges with trimellitic anhydride (tma) for 10 days. lcr35 was orally administered to the mice once daily throughout the  study. in the tma-induced ad model, orally administered lcr35 suppressed significantly irritant-related scratching behaviour and skin dehydration as well  as apparent severity of ad. lcr35 also significantly decreased serum levels of ige and il-4, but not ifn-gamma, implying the restoration of tma-induced disruption of th1/th2 balance. quantitative real-time pcr targeting hypervariable regions of 16s rdna gene of faecal microbiota indicated that the lcr35 treatment  increased the population of bifidobacterium, lactobacilli, enterococcus and bacteroides fragilis group, but decreased those of clostridium coccoides group. conclusions: lcr35 has the ability to suppress the development of ad in mice, possibly through the modulation of th1/th2 balance and gut microbiota. significance and impact of the study: lcr35 has a strong potential as a probiotic for preventing ad.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis polysaccharide a is necessary and sufficient for acute activation of intestinal sensory neurons.
AB  == symbionts or probiotics are known to affect the nervous system. to understand the mechanisms involved, it is important to measure sensory neuron responses and identify molecules responsible for this interaction. here we test the effects of  adding lactobacillus rhamnosus (jb-1) and bacteroides fragilis to the epithelium  while making voltage recordings from intestinal primary afferent neurons. sensory responses are recorded within 8 s of applying jb-1 and excitability facilitated within 15 min. bacteroides fragilis produces similar results, as does its isolated, capsular exopolysaccharide, polysaccharide a. lipopolysaccharide-free polysaccharide a completely mimics the neuronal effects of the parent organism. experiments with a mutant bacteroides fragilis devoid of polysaccharide a shows that polysaccharide a is necessary and sufficient for the neuronal effects. complex carbohydrates have not been reported before as candidates for such signalling between symbionts and the host. these observations indicate new neuronal targets and invite further study of bacterial carbohydrates as inter-kingdom signalling molecules between beneficial bacteria and sensory neurons.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

TI  == soluble cd14 and cd83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal th2 differentiation.
AB  == cd14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and cd83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (dc). cd14 and cd83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. we examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or dc released soluble cd14 (scd14) or scd83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis. we found that the gram-positive bacteria c. perfringens and s. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of scd14 from  monocytes. dc, on the other hand, released scd14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein a seemed to be important for s. aureus-induced scd14 production from both monocytes and dc. soluble cd83 was released from dc, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria. finally, to investigate whether scd14 or scd83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced t-cell differentiation, dc were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of scd14 or scd83 and then cocultured with autologous t cells. we demonstrate that scd14 and scd83 inhibited the birch  allergen-induced th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins scd14 and scd83, which may be involved in preventing t-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.

TI  == immunomodulatory consequences of oral administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg in healthy volunteers.
AB  == probiotic microorganisms, especially lactic acid bacteria, are effective in the treatment of infectious diarrhoeal diseases and experimental colitis. although the mechanisms by which these organisms exert their anti-inflammatory effects are largely unknown, immunomodulating effects are suggested. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of a 5-week oral administration of lactobacillus  rhamnosus subspecies gg (lb. gg) on the cellular immune response to intestinal microorganisms in ten healthy volunteers. peripheral blood cells (pb) were stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and isolated bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (bfg) or escherichia coli (esch. coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10, il-4, il-6, ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha) were measured in the culture supernatant. cd4+ t-lymphocyte activation was determined by measurement of intracellular atp following lysis of the cells.  the activational response of cd4+ t-lymphocytes towards isolated and heat-inactivated intestinal organisms was increased after the probiotic treatment. additionally, tnf-alpha, il-6 and in part ifn-gamma cytokine secretion by pb cells following stimulation with whole stool preparations and single members of the flora was significantly decreased, whereas the il-10 and in part il-4 cytokine secretion was increased at the end of the study. in contrast, the activational response of cd4+ t-lymphocytes following stimulation with whole 'non-self' intestinal flora was higher than by 'self' intestinal flora, but both  responses showed a trend towards a reduction at the end of the study. this study  documents a direct effect by lb. gg on the cellular immune system of healthy volunteers and offers a promising tool to investigate systemic immunomodulation due to oral administration of probiotic microorganisms.
