TI  - Effect of yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp . lactis DN-173010 probiotic on dental plaque and saliva in orthodontic patients.
AB  - AIM: To assess how consumption of yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 probiotic for a period of 2 weeks affects salivary and dental plaque levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. METHODS: A crossover, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed with 26 volunteers. The study was divided into four periods. During periods 2 and 4, the volunteers ingested yogurt containing probiotic or control yogurt daily for 2 weeks. Periods 1 and 3 were a 1-week run-in period and 4-week washout period, respectively. Saliva and dental plaque samples were collected from each participant at the end of each period. Mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and total cultivable microorganisms were counted. Values were compared between groups and across periods with the Wilcoxon's test. RESULTS: There was no difference between the yogurt containing probiotic and the control yogurt for any of the studied variables (all p > 0.05). A reduction in counts of total cultivable microorganisms was observed in dental plaque samples after ingestion of either yogurts (both p < 0.05 vs. baseline), but not in saliva (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Daily ingestion of yogurt with or without B. animalis subsp. lactis for a period of 2 weeks was beneficial in reducing total microbial counts in dental plaque. Therefore, no additional benefits were achieved by the use of the tested probiotic strain.
TI  - Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 administration in early childhood: a randomized clinical trial of effects on oral colonization by mutans streptococci and the probiotic.
AB  - A randomized clinical trial studied the effects of early administration of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) on oral colonization of (1) mutans streptococci (MS), and (2) BB-12. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, infants (n = 106) received probiotic bacteria (BB-12 group), xylitol (X group), or sorbitol (S group). Test tablets were administered twice a day (from the age of 1-2 months) with a novel slow-release pacifier or a spoon (daily dose of BB-12 10(10) CFU, polyol 200-600 mg). Samples were collected from mucosa/teeth at the age of 8 months and 2 years for BB- 12 determination (qPCR) and plate culturing of MS (MSB, TYCSB), lactobacilli (Rogosa) and yeasts (Sabouraud). The MS levels of the mothers were determined (Dentocult SM Strip Mutans). The baseline characteristics of the three groups were similar. Mean duration of tablet delivery was 14.9 +/- 6.7 months. In all groups, >90% of the mothers showed high MS counts (log CFU >/=5). MS colonization percentages of the children at the age of 2 years were rather low (BB-12 group: 6%; X group: 31%; S group: 10%; p < 0.05). The levels of lactobacilli and yeasts did not differ between the groups. BB-12 cell counts barely exceeding the detection limit were found in three of the oral samples of the 8-month-old children; however, the 2-year samples did not contain BB-12. The early administration of BB-12 did not result in permanent oral colonization of this probiotic or significantly affect MS colonization in the children.
TI  - Reduction of salivary mutans streptococci in orthodontic patients during daily consumption of yoghurt containing probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that probiotic supplements in dairy products may  affect the oral microbial ecology, but the effect in orthodontic patients has not previously been reported. The aim of the present study was to examine whether short-term consumption of fruit yogurt containing probiotic bifidobacteria would affect the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. A double-blind, randomized crossover study was performed and 24 healthy adolescents (12-16 years) undergoing orthodontic treatment were followed over four periods. During periods 2 and 4 (2 weeks each), the subjects ingested 200 g fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 (2 x 10(8) colony forming units/g) once daily or a control yogurt without viable bacteria. Periods 1 and 3 were run-in and wash-out periods of 1 and 6 weeks, respectively. Salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated with chair-side kits before and after the yogurt consumption periods. Pre- and post-treatment values within each regimen were compared with a two-tailed marginal homogeneity test for categorical data. A statistically significant reduction of salivary mutans streptococci was recorded after probiotic yogurt consumption (P < 0.05), which was in contrast to the control yogurt. No significant alterations of the salivary lactobacilli counts were observed. Short-term daily consumption of fruit yogurt containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173010 may reduce the levels of mutans streptococci in saliva during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.
