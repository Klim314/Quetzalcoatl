TI  - Conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. Our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. RESULTS: Samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. All samples showed bacterial growth. Thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. Detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. Most frequently isolated bacterial species were Bacillus spp. (13 isolates), Staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), Staphylococcus sciuri and Aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), Ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). Only one isolate of Kocuria varians/rosea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lentus, Morganella morganii, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. The presence in 8 animals of Mycoplasma spp. and in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of Chlamydia spp. was detected by PCR. Candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. CONCLUSIONS: A clear predominance of Gram positive isolates in tortoises and Gram negative isolates in turtles was found. However, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. Almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. That chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard to Salmonella spp. Therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. Worthy of note is the finding of Chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in Grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  - In a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in Grenada, West Indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth, nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. A total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to species level and 46 to genus level. A commercial bacterial identification system (API/Biomerieux), was used for this purpose. The most common species was Escherichia coli (N=60), followed by Staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), S. hominis (16), S. haemolyticus (12), Streptococcus canis (9), Proteus mirabilis (8), Pasteurella multocida (7), Streptococcus mitis (7), Staphylococcus xylosus (7), S. capitis (6), S. chromogenes (4), S. sciuri (3), S. auricularis (2), S. lentus (2), S. hyicus (2), Streptococcus suis (2) and Pseudomonas argentinensis (2). Sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. A molecular method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. Salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. E. coli and S. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. S. felis/simulans was the most common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. P. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. Staphylococcus aureus, or S. intemedius/S. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. Antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested against, including tetracycline.
