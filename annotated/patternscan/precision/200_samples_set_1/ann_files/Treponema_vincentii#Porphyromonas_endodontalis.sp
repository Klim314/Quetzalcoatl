TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.
