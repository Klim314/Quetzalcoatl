TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.
