TI  == white-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  == white-spot lesions (wsl) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. we characterized the microbiota of wsl, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. participants were 60 children with  fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with wsl. plaque samples were  assayed by a 16s rrna-based microarray (homim) and by pcr. mean gingival index was positively associated with wsl (p = 0.018). taxa associated with wsl by microarray included granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), veillonellaceae sp. hot 155 (p < 0.01), and bifidobacterium cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qpcr, streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), actinomyces sp. hot 448 (p = 0.003), prevotella cluster iv (p = 0.021), and streptococcus sp. hot 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of s. mutans (p = 0.02) and bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qpcr. species' associations with wsl were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without wsl. granulicatella, veillonellaceae and bifidobacteriaceae, in addition  to s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of wsl in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with wsl.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.
