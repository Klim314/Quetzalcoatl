TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the levansucrase gene from Acetobacter xylinum NCI 1005.
AB  - The levansucrase gene (lsxA) was cloned from the genomic DNA of Acetobacter xylinum NCI 1005, and the nucleotide sequence of the lsxA gene (1,293 bp) was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the lsxA gene showed 57.4% and 46.2% identity with the levansucrases from Zymomonas mobilis and Erwinia amylovora, respectively, while only 35.2% identity with that from Acetobacter diazotrophicus. The gene product of lsxA (LsxA) that was overproduced in E. coli coded for a polypeptide of molecular mass 47 kDa. The LsxA released glucose and produced polysaccharide from sucrose, the structure of which was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and determined to be a beta-(2,6)-linked polyfructan.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression in Escherichia coli of levansucrase  genes from the plant pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  - Plant-pathogenic bacteria produce various extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) which may function as virulence factors in diseases caused by these bacteria. The EPS levan is synthesized by the extracellular enzyme levansucrase in Pseudomonas syringae, Erwinia amylovora, and other bacterial species. The lsc genes encoding levansucrase from P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NCPPB 1321 were cloned, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Heterologous expression of the lsc gene in Escherichia coli was found in four and two genomic library clones of strains PG4180 and NCPPB 1321, respectively. A 3. 0-kb PstI fragment common to all six clones conferred levan synthesis on E. coli when further subcloned. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,248-bp open reading frame (ORF) derived from PG4180 and a 1,296-bp ORF derived from NCPPB 1321, which were both designated lsc. Both ORFs showed high homology to the E. amylovora and Zymomonas mobilis lsc genes at the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. Levansucrase was not secreted into the supernatant but was located in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli harboring the lsc gene. Expression of lsc was found to be dependent on the vector-based Plac promoter, indicating that the native promoter of lsc was not functional in E. coli. Insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette in the lsc gene abolished levan synthesis in E. coli. A PCR screening with primers derived from lsc of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 allowed the detection of this gene in a number of related bacteria.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the levansucrase gene from the endophytic sugarcane bacterium Acetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4.
AB  - The Acetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4 gene encoding levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10) (IsdA) was isolated from a genomic library. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.3 kb DNA fragment sufficient for complementation of a levansucrase-deficient mutant (obtained by EMS treatment) was determined. The IsdA gene (1751 bp) coded for a polypeptide of molecular mass 64.9 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.2. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the extracellular levansucrase indicated the presence of a precursor protein with a putative signal sequence of 51 residues which is possibly cleaved in two successive steps. Expression of the IsdA gene from the lac promoter in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of a protein with levansucrase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of the IsdA gene was 48% and 46% identical with the levansucrases from the Gram-negative bacteria Zymomonas mobilis and Erwinia amylovora, respectively, but only 28-31% identical with levansucrases from Gram-positive bacteria. Multiple alignments of published levansucrase sequences from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed eight conserved motifs. A comparison of the catalytic properties and the sequence of the A. diazotrophicus levansucrase with those of the Bacillus subtilis levansucrase suggested that one of these motifs may be involved in the specificity of the synthetized product. Disruption of the IsdA gene in the genome of A. diazotrophicus resulted in a mutant lacking both levansucrase activity and the ability to utilize sucrose as a carbon source, suggesting that levansucrase is the key enzyme in sucrose metabolism of A. diazotrophicus.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an extracellular levansucrase from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  - Levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10), an exoenzyme of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, was purified to homogeneity from the cell supernatant by chromatography on TMAE-Fraktogel and butyl-Fraktogel. The enzyme has molecular masses of 45 kDa under denaturing conditions and 68 kDa during gel filtration of the native form. In isoelectric focusing, active bands appeared at pH 3.55 and 3.6. Maximum sucrose cleaving activities were measured at pH 5.8 to 6.6 and 60 degrees C. The enzyme was highly tolerant to denaturing agents, proteases, and repeated freezing and thawing. The molecular weight of the produced levan depended on temperature, salinity, and sucrose concentration. The enzyme had levan-degrading activity and did not accept raffinose as a substrate. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence with the predicted amino acid sequence of levansucrases from Erwinia amylovora and Zymomonas mobilis showed 88 and 69% similarity, respectively, in amino acids 5 to 20. No similarity could be detected to levansucrases of gram-positive bacteria in the first 20 amino acids. By comparison of all levansucrases which have been sequenced to date, the enzyme seems to be conserved in the gram-negative bacteria. The rheological behavior of the product levan prompted a new assessment of the enzyme's role in pathogenesis. Depending on formation conditions, levan solutions exclude other polymer solutions. This behavior supports the presumption that the levansucrase is important in the early phase of infection by creating a separating layer between bacteria and plant cell wall to prevent the pathogen from recognition.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the extracellular sucrase gene (sacC) of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene sacC that encodes the extracellular sucrase (protein B46) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene was found to be present downstream to the already described levansucrase gene sacB in the cloned chromosomal fragment of Z. mobilis. The expression product was different from SacB and exhibited sucrase but not levansucrase activity; therefore, SacC behaves like a true sucrase. Expression of sacC in E. coli JM109 and XL1 was very low; overexpression was observed in E. coli BL21 after induction of the T7 polymerase expression system with IPTG. Subcellular fractionation of the E. coli clone carrying plasmid pLSS2811 showed that more than 70% of the sucrase activity could be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that the enzyme was soluble and not secreted in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence analysis of sacC revealed an open reading frame 1239bp long coding for a 413 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa. The first 30 deduced amino acids from this ORF were identical with those from the N-terminal sequence of the extracellular sucrase (protein B46) purified from Z. mobilis ZM4. No leader peptide sequence could be identified in the sacC gene. The amino acid sequence of SacC showed very little similarity to those of other known sucrases, but was very similar to the levansucrases of Z. mobilis (61.5%), Erwinia amylovora (40.2%) and Bacillus subtilis (25.6%).
