TI  == microbial evaluation of traumatized teeth treated with triple antibiotic paste or calcium hydroxide with 2% chlorhexidine gel in pulp revascularization.
AB  == introduction: revascularization outcome depends on microbial elimination because  apical repair will not happen in the presence of infected tissues. this study evaluated the microbial composition of traumatized immature teeth and assessed their reduction during different stages of the revascularization procedures performed with 2 intracanal medicaments. methods: fifteen patients (7-17 years old) with immature teeth were submitted to the revascularization procedures; they were divided into 2 groups according to the intracanal medicament used: tap group (n = 7), medicated with a triple antibiotic paste, and chp group (n = 8), dressed with calcium hydroxide + 2% chlorhexidine gel. samples were taken before any treatment (s1), after irrigation with 6% naocl (s2), after irrigation with 2% chlorhexidine (s3), after intracanal dressing (s4), and after 17% edta irrigation (s5). cultivable bacteria recovered from the 5 stages were counted and identified by means of polymerase chain reaction assay (16s rrna). results: both groups had  colony-forming unit counts significantly reduced after s2 (p < .05); however, no  significant difference was found between the irrigants (s2 and s3, p = .99). no difference in bacteria counts was found between the intracanal medicaments used (p = .95). the most prevalent bacteria detected were actinomyces naeslundii (66.67%), followed by porphyromonas endodontalis, parvimonas micra, and fusobacterium nucleatum, which were detected in 33.34% of the root canals. an average of 2.13 species per canal was found, and no statistical correlation was observed between bacterial species and clinical/radiographic features. conclusions: the microbial profile of infected immature teeth is similar to that  of primarily infected permanent teeth. the greatest bacterial reduction was promoted by the irrigation solutions. the revascularization protocols that used the tested intracanal medicaments were efficient in reducing viable bacteria in necrotic immature teeth.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == bacterial flora and extraradicular biofilm associated with the apical segment of  teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: microorganisms are able to survive and cause persistent infection in the extraradicular area. the aims of this study were to investigate the primary bacterial flora and the localization of extraradicular biofilm in persistent apical periodontitis lesions. methods: apical root samples from root-end surgery were collected from 23 root-filled teeth with apical periodontitis. five samples were examined for the presence of biofilm by scanning electron microscopy. another 5 samples were examined for the presence of biofilm  by brown and brenn-modified gram staining. the dna from 13 samples was processed  for amplification via polymerase chain reaction and separated with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. selected bands were excised from the gel and sequenced for identification. results: the extraradicular biofilm present on the  external root surface of treated teeth consisted of abundant, amorphous extracellular material and multiple bacterial species. the following species were detected in the microbial community from the apical samples: actinomyces sp. oral, propionibacterium, prevotella sp. oral, streptococcus, porphyromonas endodontalis, and burkholderia. the prevalence of actinomyces sp. oral and propionibacterium were highest (84.6% and 61.5%, respectively). conclusions: extraradicular biofilm was present on the external root surface of treated teeth  with persistent periapical lesions. actinomyces sp. oral and propionibacterium are likely important contributors to extraradicular biofilm formation and persistent periapical infection.

TI  == identification of dominant pathogens in periapical lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to identify dominant pathogens in the periapical lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis. methods: thirty-three root-filled teeth with persistent apical periodontitis referred for surgical treatment were selected. microbial samples were collected from the periapical lesions during apical surgery. microbial identification was performed with species-specific primers prepared according to the sequence analysis data using a 16s rrna technique. results: among the 33 cases, in 5 cases none of the target species were detected, 6 cases showed the presence of only one species, and 22 cases showed more than two species. porphyromonas endodontalis (45% of sample) was the  most commonly detected dominant microbial species in the study sample, followed by actinomyces viscosus (42%), candida albicans (36%) and porphyromonas gingivalis (27%). fusobacterium, actinomyces israelii and enterococcus faecalis were also detected in 27%, 21% and 15% of the sample, respectively. the most frequently isolated species, p. endodontalis, was in most cases detected together with actinomyces (14 cases) and p. gingivalis (6 cases). none of the lesions analysed in the present study contained prevotella intermedia. there was no correlation in relation to the presence of sinus tracts and the bacterial species. conclusion: a mixed population of pathogens was found in the endodontic  lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis. p. endodontalis, a. viscosus, c. albicans and p. gingivalis were the dominant species identified.

TI  == comparison of the in vivo antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite and  chlorhexidine used as root canal irrigants: a molecular microbiology study.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this clinical study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) when used as irrigants during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. methods: forty-seven single-rooted single-canal teeth with necrotic pulps and asymptomatic apical periodontitis were selected for this study according to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. bacterial samples were taken at the baseline (s1) and after (s2) chemomechanical preparation using 2.5% naocl (n = 30) or 0.12% chx (n = 17) as the irrigant. bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr), whereas bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: all s1 samples were pcr positive for bacterial presence but negative for both archaea and fungi. both naocl- and chx-based protocols were significantly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. no significant differences were observed between them in all tested parameters including the incidence of negative pcr results in s2 (40% for naocl vs 47% for chx, p = 0.8), reduction in  the number of taxa per canal (p = 0.3), and reduction in the bacterial levels (p  = 0.07). the most prevalent taxa in s2 samples from the naocl group were propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus species, porphyromonas endodontalis, and selenomonas sputigena. in the chx group, the most prevalent taxa in s2 were dialister invisus, actinomyces israelii, prevotella baroniae, propionibacterium acidifaciens, and streptococcus species. conclusions: treatment protocols using irrigation with either naocl or chx succeeded in significantly reducing the the number of bacterial taxa and their levels in infected root canals, with no significant difference between these substances.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibody inhibiting dipeptidylaminopeptidase iv activity of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species implicated as an important pathogen in the development of adult periodontitis. we previously cloned a gene encoding dipeptydilaminopeptidase iv (dapiv) from p. gingivalis. in the present study, for immunological diagnosis and development of  passive immunization, we produced a mouse monoclonal antibody (mab) capable of inhibiting the dapiv activity of p. gingivalis using highly purified recombinant  dapiv as an immunogen. the constructed mab, designated as mab-pg-dap-1, significantly inhibited dapiv activity in p. gingivalis, as well as slightly inhibited that in other gram-negative bacteria such as porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella loesheii, whereas no inhibition was seen in the gram-positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus. furthermore, the mab did  not inhibit dapiv enzyme activity in human serum. this novel mab may be useful for the development of immunological diagnosis capability and in passive immunization.

TI  == the subgingival microflora in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia.
AB  == objectives: microbial flora and gingival conditions were compared between a group of patients with phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia as a test group, a control group of patients who were administered phenytoin without gingival hyperplasia and a blank group who took no phenytoin and no gingival hyperplasia in mentally retarded patients. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples  were collected from a pht-induced overgrown gingival pocket and microbiological experiments were performed by culture and pcr methods. results: the predominant genera in total cultivable bacteria from subgingival plaque samples were streptococcus and actinomyces with recovery ranges of 37.6-42.1% and 23.4-25.5% of total bacteria, respectively, in all groups. the test group showed a significantly higher level of obligate gram-negative rods than the control and blank groups. black-pigmented obligate anaerobic gram-negative rods were detected in 10.3% of total cultivable bacteria in the test group. the black-pigmented rods were predominantly prevotella intermedia in the test group and prevotella nigrescens in the control and blank groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis were also detected in the test group with small values. conclusions: these results suggested that black-pigmented rods, particularly p. intermedia, could be habitable in the environment of gingival hyperplasia.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dental implant metals.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the specific in vitro antibacterial effect of seven dental implant metals on oral bacteria which have often been identified in failing implants. the metals chosen for evaluation were titanium, chromium, cobalt, aluminum, iron, gold, and vanadium. these metals were selected  because they are contained in many commonly used dental implants. the bacteria selected for this study included isolates of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaniogenica, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. sets of tubes containing either supplemented trypticase soy broth, brain-heart infusion-yeast extract, or brain-heart infusion-yeast extract with 5  percent defibrinated rabbit blood were aseptically prepared with doubling dilutions of the seven metals starting at an initial concentration of 500 micrograms/ml and terminating at 0 microgram/ml. cultures of each organism were inoculated into each set of broth tubes containing all concentrations of metals.  tubes were incubated either anaerobically or in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide for 48 hours at 35 degrees c and then assayed for atp content which was proportional to the viable cellular biomass. the results showed that, although being bacteria and concentration dependent, all seven metals suppressed the growth of each organism. the rank order of antibacterial activity expressed by dental implant metals was gold > titanium > cobalt > vanadium > aluminum > chromium > iron.

TI  == reactivity of igg from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  == the presence of igg in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. the purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of igg from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. a dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-elisa) was used to demonstrate the presence of igg in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. the percentages of reactivity by dot-elisa follow: bacteroides intermedius (84%), b.  buccae (12%), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), p. endodontalis (58%), p. asaccharolyticus (17%), peptostreptococcus micros (44%), p. anaerobius  (26%), eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and actinomyces israelii (6%). at least one of the three species of b. intermedius, p. gingivalis, or p. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-elisa with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. a lack of cross reactivity of igg in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented bacteroides/porphyromonas by dot-elisa.
