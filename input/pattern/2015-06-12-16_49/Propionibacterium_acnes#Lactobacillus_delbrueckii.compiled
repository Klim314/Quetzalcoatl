TI  - Bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. Recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. The aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. METHODS: Universal eubacterial primers were used to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. Subsequently, PCR amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in GenBank. RESULTS: Sequences of Stenotrophomonas spp., including S. maltophilia (formerly Pseudomonas homology group V) were detected in six aneurysm samples. Propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and Brevundimonas diminuta (formerly P. diminuta) in four samples. Other species previously assigned to the Pseudomonas genus such as Comamonas testosteroni, Delftia acidovorans, Burkholderia cepacia, Herbaspirillum sp., and Acidovorax sp. were also detected. Some clones fell into other environmental species, including Methylobacterium sp. and Bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria that have not yet been cultivated. DNA sequences from oral bacteria, including Streptococcus sanguinis, Tannerella forsythia, and Leptotrichia buccalis were detected. Sequences from Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. Additional species included Dermacoccus spp. and Corynebacterium vitaeruminis. CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development. Several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although Chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. Overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. In the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. The presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at C.pneumoniae.
TI  - Characterization of thoeniicin 447, a bacteriocin isolated from Propionibacterium thoenii strain 447.
AB  - Fifteen strains of propionibacteria, isolated from dairy products, were screened  for the production of bacteriocins. Propionibacterium thoenii 447 produced an antimicrobial peptide, thoeniicin 447, which acted bactericidal against Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and bacteriostatic against Propionibacterium acnes. Thoeniicin 447 remained active after 15 min at 100 degrees C and after 30 min of incubation at pH 1-10. The peptide was inactivated when treated with pepsin, pronase, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase K. Optimal bacteriocin production was detected during late exponential growth. The peptide was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography. The estimated size of thoeniicin 447, according to tricine-SDS-PAGE, is 6 kDa. Based on DNA sequencing, the mature peptide is 7130.20 Da in size and homologous to propionicin T1, produced by P. thoenii strain 419 (=NCFB 568(T)). Strain 447 is phenotypically different from strain 419 and belongs to a separate ribotype cluster. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacteriocin from a Propionibacterium species active against P. acnes.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
