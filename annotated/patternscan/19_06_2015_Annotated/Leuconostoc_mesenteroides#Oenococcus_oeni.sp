TI  == selection of lactic acid bacteria from brazilian kefir grains for potential use as starter or probiotic cultures.
AB  == brazilian kefir is a homemade fermented beverage that is obtained by incubating milk or a brown sugar solution with kefir grains that contribute their different  microbiological compositions. it is highly important to isolate and characterize  microorganisms from brazilian kefir grains to obtain starter cultures for the industrial production of a standardized commercial kefir. thus, the present study aimed to isolate lactic acid bacteria from eight kefir grains that were propagated in milk or sugar solutions from five different locations in brazil and to select lactobacillus isolates based on desirable in vitro probiotic properties. one hundred eight isolates from both substrates were identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and/or 16s rrna gene sequencing and  were determined to belong to the following 11 species from the genera: lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus (l.), and oenococcus. leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens were isolated only from milk grains, whereas lactobacillus perolens, lactobacillus parafarraginis, lactobacillus diolivorans, and oenococcus oeni were isolated exclusively from sugar water grains. when the microbial compositions of four kefir grains were evaluated with culture-independent analyses, l. kefiranofaciens was observed to predominant in milk grains, whereas lactobacillus hilgardii was most abundant in sugar water kefir. unfortunately, l. hilgardii was not isolated  from any grain, although this bacteria was detected with a culture-independent methodology. fifty-two isolated lactobacilli were tested for gastric juice and bile salt tolerance, antagonism against pathogens, antimicrobial resistance, and  surface hydrophobicity. three lactobacillus strains (l. kefiranofaciens 8u, l. diolivorans 1z, and lactobacillus casei 17u) could be classified as potential probiotics. in conclusion, several lactic acid bacteria that could be used in combination with yeasts as starter cultures for both milk kefir and sugar water kefir were characterized, and the functional properties of several of the lactobacilli isolated from the kefir grains were suggestive of their possible use as probiotics in both kefir and other dairy products.

TI  == microbial communities in air and wine of a winery at two consecutive vintages.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts in air and wine of a winery, in order to evaluate the possible exchange of microorganisms between them. samples were taken in a winery located in castilla-la mancha (spain) during the winemaking period of two consecutive vintages (2011 and 2012). the microbial composition was determined by using both a culture-dependent method and a culture-independent method, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). in addition, genetic characterization of isolates from plates was carried out. a high diversity of species was detected in air and wine samples from both vintages. leuconostoc mesenteroides was the predominant lactic acid bacteria in air from both vintages while oenococcus oeni was the predominant in wine. saccharomyces cerevisiae was the most frequently isolated yeast in both air and wine. typing of o. oeni and s. cerevisiae isolates from air and wine samples  showed the presence of coincident genotypes in both samples, that would confirm the exchange of microorganisms between the two environments, air and wine, and furthermore some of these genotypes were also found at samples taken at different vintages, indicating that they would remain in the winery. the results display the influence of the activity taking place in the winery and the moment of fermentation of the wines in tanks, on the microorganisms present in the air and  the role of the air for the dispersal of microorganisms within the winery.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == a beta-glucosidase from oenococcus oeni atcc baa-1163 with potential for aroma release in wine: cloning and expression in e. coli.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are responsible for olfactory changes in wine during malolactic fermentation (mlf). a side characteristic of mlf is the release of grape derived aroma compounds from their glycosylated precursors by beta-glycosidase activities of these bacteria. apart from oenococcus oeni, which  is regarded as the most promising species for mlf, glycosidic activities have also been observed in wine related members of the genera lactobacillus and pediococcus. nevertheless, information on the involved enzymes including their potential use in winemaking is limited. in this study we report that beta-glucosidases with similar protein sequences can be identified in the genomes of lactobacillus brevis, o. oeni and leuconostoc mesenteroides. ttg serves as start codon for the glucosidase gene of o. oeni. the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni  atcc baa-1163 was expressed in e. coli and partially characterized. the enzyme displayed characteristics similar to beta-glucosidases isolated from l. brevis and l. mesenteroides. a ph optimum between 5.0 and 5.5, and a k(m) of 0.17 mmol l(-1 )pnp-beta-d-glucopyranoside were determined. a glycosyltransferase activity  was observed in the presence of ethanol. the enzyme from o. oeni was capable to hydrolyze glycosides extracted from muskat wine. this study also contains a report on glycosidase activities of several lab species including oenococcus kitaharae.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from musts and wines of three consecutive vintages of ribeira sacra.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to isolate and characterize the lactic acid microbiota of the musts and wines of a young denomination of origin area, ribeira sacra in north-west spain. methods and results: over three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2009), we examined musts and wines from four cellars in different zones of the region. through biochemical and genetic tests, 459 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were identified as the following species: lactobacillus alvei (0.7%), lactobacillus brevis (1.7%), lactobacillus frumenti (0.9%), lactobacillus kunkeei (12%), lactobacillus plantarum (6.5%), lactobacillus pentosus (0.9%), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (3%), leuconostoc citreum (0.7%), leuconostoc fructosum (synon. lactobacillus fructosum) (3.7%), leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides (2.8%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (0.2%), oenococcus oeni (59%), pediococcus parvulus (7%) and  weisella paramesenteroides (synon. leuconostoc paramesenteroides) (0.9%). of these species, o. oeni was the main one responsible for malolactic fermentation (mlf) in all cellars and years with the exception of lact. plantarum, predominant in 2007, in one cellar, and lact. brevis, lact. frumenti and ped. parvulus coexisting with o. oeni in one cellar in 2009. different strains (84) of lab species (14) were identified by biochemical techniques (api strips, the presence  of plasmids, enzyme activities and mlf performance) and molecular techniques (pcr). all assays were carried out with every one of the 459 isolates. to select  candidates for use as culture starters, we assessed malolactic, beta-glucosidase  and tannase activities, the presence of genes involved in biogenic amine production and plasmid content. conclusions: a high diversity of lab is present in the grape musts of ribeira sacra but few species are responsible for mlf; however, different strains of such species are involved in the process. as far as we are aware, this is the first report of lact. frumenti thriving in wine. significance and impact of the study: information on lab populations in must and  wine is presented. a large collection of well-characterized strains of lab are available as starter cultures to winemakers.

TI  == detection of arc genes related with the ethyl carbamate precursors in wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == trace amounts of the carcinogen ethyl carbamate can appear in wine by the reaction of ethanol with compounds such as citrulline and carbamyl phosphate, which are produced from arginine degradation by some wine lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, the presence of arc genes for the arginine-deiminase pathway was studied in several strains of different species of lab. their ability to degrade arginine was also studied. to detect the presence of arc genes, degenerate primers were designed from the alignment of protein sequences in already sequenced lab. the usefulness of these degenerate primers has been proven by sequencing some of the amplified pcr fragments and searching for homologies with published sequences of the same species and related ones. correlation was found between the presence of genes and the ability to degrade arginine. degrading strains included all heterofermentative lactobacilli, oenococcus oeni , pediococcus pentosaceus , and some strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus plantarum .

TI  == molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == role of hypermutability in the evolution of the genus oenococcus.
AB  == oenococcus oeni is an alcohol-tolerant, acidophilic lactic acid bacterium primarily responsible for malolactic fermentation in wine. a recent comparative genomic analysis of o. oeni psu-1 with other sequenced lactic acid bacteria indicates that psu-1 lacks the mismatch repair (mmr) genes muts and mutl. consistent with the lack of mmr, mutation rates for o. oeni psu-1 and a second oenococcal species, o. kitaharae, were higher than those observed for neighboring taxa, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. sequence analysis of the rpob mutations in rifampin-resistant strains from both oenococcal species revealed a high percentage of transition mutations, a result indicative of the lack of mmr. an analysis of common alleles in the two sequenced o. oeni strains,  psu-1 and baa-1163, also revealed a significantly higher level of transition substitutions than were observed in other lactobacillales species. these results  suggest that the genus oenococcus is hypermutable due to the loss of muts and mutl, which occurred with the divergence away from the neighboring leuconostoc branch. the hypermutable status of the genus oenococcus explains the observed high level of allelic polymorphism among known o. oeni isolates and likely contributed to the unique adaptation of this genus to acidic and alcoholic environments.

TI  == assessment of antibiotic susceptibility within lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from wine.
AB  == susceptibility to 12 antibiotics was tested in 75 unrelated lactic acid bacteria  strains of wine origin of the following species: 38 lactobacillus plantarum, 3 lactobacillus hilgardii, 2 lactobacillus paracasei, 1 lactobacillus sp, 21 oenococcus oeni, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 2 pediococcus parvulus, 1 pediococcus acidilactici, and 3 leuconostoc mesenteroides. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the different antibiotics that inhibited 50% of the strains of  the lactobacillus, leuconostoc and pediococcus genera were, respectively, the following ones: penicillin (2, < or =0.5, and < or =0.5 microg/ml), erythromycin  (< or =0.5 microg/ml), chloramphenicol (4 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (64, 8, and 128 microg/ml), vancomycin (> or =128 microg/ml), tetracycline (8, 2, and 8 microg/ml), streptomycin (256, 32, and 512 microg/ml), gentamicin (64, 4, and 128 microg/ml), kanamycin (256, 64, and 512 microg/ml), sulfamethoxazole (> or =1024  microg/ml), and trimethoprim (16 microg/ml). all 21 o. oeni showed susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and chloramphenicol, and exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, that could represent intrinsic resistance. differences were observed among the o. oeni strains with respect to penicillin or ciprofloxacin susceptibility. antibiotic resistance genes were studied by pcr and sequencing, and the following genes were detected: erm(b) (one p. acidilactici), tet(m) (one l. plantarum), tet(l) (one p. parvulus), aac(6')-aph(2") (four l. plantarum, one p. parvulus, one p. pentosaceus and two o. oeni), ant(6) (one l. plantarum, and two p. parvulus), and aph(3')-iiia (one l. plantarum and one o. oeni). this is the first time, to our knowledge, that ant(6), aph(3')-iiia and tet(l) genes are found in lactobacillus and pediococcus strains and antimicrobial resistance genes are reported in o. oeni strains.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == rpob gene: a target for identification of lab cocci by pcr-dgge and melting curves analyses in real time pcr.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are essential in the quality of many fermented beverages like beer, cider and wine. in the two later cases, they convert malic acid into lactic acid during the malolactic fermentation. after fermentation, microbial stabilization is needed to prevent the development of spoilage bacteria species. among them, cocci lead to different alterations: pediococcus sp., and some strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides and oenococcus oeni can produce exopolysaccharides which modify wine viscosity and lead to ropiness. they also can produce acetic acid, biogenic amine, ethyl carbamate and volatile phenols. therefore detection and identification are crucial. results of phenotypic tests and dna-dna probes are not accurate enough. 16s rna gene which is currently used  for bacterial species identification presents intraspecies heterogeneity. the rpob gene is an alternative to this limitation. however previous pcr targeting partial sequence of rpob gene could not delimit cocci species. therefore we compared the rpob gene sequence of the six main cocci species found in fermented  beverages: p. damnosus, p. dextrinicus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides and o. oeni. the most discriminating partial sequence of the rpob gene was chosen for designing primers. by pcr-dgge the reliability of these primers was verified. it was controlled in a mixture of several cocci and other lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus sp.). then we adapted the primers and the pcr conditions in order to achieve the identification of cocci species by real time pcr program including the fluorescent dye sybr green i, which gives faster results. pcr melt curves were established and a specific t(m) was attributed to each species.

TI  == characterization of islpl4, a functional insertion sequence in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == a lactobacillus plantarum strain, cect 4645, was found to have insertions of a sequence (985 bp in length) at least in eight loci in its genome. the prototype copy (lp1) of this insertion sequence (named islpl4) has one open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 292 amino acids in length with significant levels of similarity with is982 family transposases. perfect 16-bp inverted repeats were found at its termini. upon transposition, generates 8-bp direct repeats of the target sequence, but no consensus sequences could be identified at either insertion site. the islpl4 pattern changed over many generations on the cect 4645 strain. this finding strongly supports our hypothesis that islpl4 is a  functional element in l. plantarum. some of these elements may be cryptic, since  point mutation or 1-nucleotide deletions were found in their transposase encoding genes. islpl4 copies have been detected in leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus  oeni, and lactobacillus sakei. an islpl4 copy of o. oeni contained a +1 nucleotide insertion on its transposase encoding gene and, by using an experimental system, we were able to demonstrate that this specific sequence originates a +1 programmed translational frameshifting. although the frameshifting process reported here operates at a low rate, this description might represent the first case of a functional +1 frameshifting among is.

TI  == pyruvate fermentation by oenococcus oeni and leuconostoc mesenteroides and role of pyruvate dehydrogenase in anaerobic fermentation.
AB  == the heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria oenococcus oeni and leuconostoc mesenteroides are able to grow by fermentation of pyruvate as the carbon source (2 pyruvate --> 1 lactate + 1 acetate + 1 co(2)). the growth yields amount to 4.0 and 5.3 g (dry weight)/mol of pyruvate, respectively, suggesting formation of 0.5 mol atp/mol pyruvate. pyruvate is oxidatively decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl coenzyme a, which is then converted to acetate, yielding  1 mol of atp. for nadh reoxidation, one further pyruvate molecule is reduced to lactate. the enzymes of the pathway were present after growth on pyruvate, and genome analysis showed the presence of the corresponding structural genes. the bacteria contain, in addition, pyruvate oxidase activity which is induced under microoxic conditions. other homo- or heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria showed only low pyruvate fermentation activity.

TI  == the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus has a novel structure.
AB  == in methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, oxaloacetate synthesis is a major and  essential co(2)-fixation reaction. this methanogenic archaeon possesses two oxaloacetate-synthesizing enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from this organism was purified  to homogeneity. the subunit size of this homotetrameric protein was 55 kda, which is about half that of all known bacterial and eukaryotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (ppcs). the nh(2)-terminal sequence identified this enzyme as the product of mth943, an open reading frame with no assigned function in the genome  sequence. a blast search did not show an obvious sequence similarity between mth943 and known ppcs, which are generally well conserved. this is the first report of a new type of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase that we call ppca ("a" for "archaeal"). homologs to ppca were present in most archaeal genomic sequences, but only in three bacterial (clostridium perfringens, oenococcus oeni, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) and no eukaryotic genomes. ppca was the only recognizable oxaloacetate-producing enzyme in methanopyrus kandleri, a hydrothermal vent organism. each ppca-containing organism lacked a ppc homolog. the activity of m. thermautotrophicus ppca was not influenced by acetyl coenzyme  a and was about 50 times less sensitive to aspartate than the escherichia coli ppc. the catalytic core (including his(138), arg(587), and gly(883)) of the e. coli ppc was partly conserved in ppca, but three of four aspartate-binding residues (lys(773), arg(832), and asn(881)) were not. ppcs probably evolved from  ppca through a process that added allosteric sites to the enzyme. the reverse is  also equally possible.

TI  == 16s-ardra, a tool for identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from grape  must and wine.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are found in a great variety of habitats, including grape must and wines. there is a close relationship between the species of lab which develop during fermentation and the eventual quality of the wine. for these reasons analytical techniques allowing fast and reliable identification of wine lab are needed. in this work a simple and accurate protocol for identifying species of lab isolated from grape must and wine is presented. this protocol is based on the amplification, directly from colony, of 16s rdna and later digestion with one of the following restriction enzymes bfai, msei and alui. a sequential use of the three enzymes is proposed to simplify lab wine identification, first msei, then bfai and finally, if necessary, alui digestion. the technique was able to discriminate 32 of the 36 lab reference species tested and allowed the identification of 342 isolates from musts and wines. the isolates belonged to the species: lactobacillus brevis, l. collinoides, l. coryniformis, l. bilgardii, l.  mali, l. paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus parvulus and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis and expression of the f1f0-atpase beta-subunit from wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the f1f0-atpase beta-subunit from  oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, pediococcus damnosus, pediococcus parvulus, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus hilgardii  were determined. their deduced amino acid sequences showed homology values of 79-98%. data from the alignment and atpase tree indicated that o. oeni and l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides formed a group well-separated from p. damnosus and p. parvulus and from the group comprises l. brevis and l. hilgardii. the n-terminus of the f1f0-atpase beta-subunit of o. oeni contains a stretch of additional 38 amino acid residues. the catalytic site of the atpase beta-subunit  of the investigated strains is characterized by the two conserved motifs ggagvgkt and gertre. the amplified atpd coding sequences were inserted into the pcrt7/ct-topo vector using ta-cloning strategy and transformed in escherichia coli. sds-page and western blot analyses confirmed that o. oeni has an atpase beta-subunit protein which is larger in size than the corresponding molecules from the investigated strains.

TI  == absence of malolactic activity is a characteristic of h+-atpase-deficient mutants of the lactic acid bacterium oenococcus oeni.
AB  == the lack of malolactic activity in h(+)-atpase-deficient mutants of oenococcus oeni selected previously was analyzed at the molecular level. western blot experiments revealed a spot at 60 kda corresponding to the malolactic enzyme only in the parental strain. moreover, the mlea transcript encoding the malolactic enzyme was not detected by reverse transcription (rt)-pcr analysis of mutants. these results suggest that the malolactic operon was not transcribed in atpase-deficient mutants. the mler gene encoding a lysr-type regulatory protein which should be involved in expression of the malolactic genes was described previously for o. oeni. results obtained in this study show that the mler transcript was not detected in the mutants by rt-pcr. no mutation in the nucleotide sequences of the mler gene and the malolactic operon was found. the effect of a reduction in h(+)-atpase activity on l-malate metabolism was then investigated by using other malolactic bacteria. spontaneous h(+)-atpase-deficient mutant strains of lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were isolated by using neomycin resistance. two mutants were selected. these mutants exhibited atpase activities that were reduced to 54 and 70% of the activities obtained for the l. lactis and l. mesenteroides parental strains, respectively. these mutants were also acid sensitive. however, in contrast to the atpase-deficient mutants of o. oeni, activation of l-malate metabolism was observed with the l. lactis and l. mesenteroides mutants under optimal or acidic growth conditions. these data support the suggestion that expression of the genes encoding malolactic enzymes in o. oeni is regulated by the mler product, as it is in l. lactis. nevertheless, our results strongly suggest that there is a difference between the regulation of expression of the malolactic locus in o. oeni and the regulation of expression of this locus in less acidophilic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == comparison of partial malolactic enzyme gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis  of some lactic acid bacteria species and relationships with the malic enzyme.
AB  == dna sequences covering 36% of the mle gene that encodes the malolactic enzyme were determined for 13 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing pediococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus and oenococcus genera. the sequences were aligned with the corresponding region of mles in lactococcus lactis. the phylogenetic distance matrix tree of all mle sequences was compared with the 16s rrna phylogenetic tree. the analysis showed that the mle fragment evolved more rapidly than the 16s gene and differently. pediococcus and lactobacillus species were intermixed in the 16s rrna tree whereas they were separated in the mle tree. leuconostoc mesenteroides and oenococcus oeni were distinct from other species in the 16s rrna tree, whereas they were intermixed with lactobacillus species and lactococcus lactis in the mle tree. the amino acid sequences deduced from partial mle genes were aligned with 22 malic enzyme sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree was constructed. malic and malolactic enzymes were distinct at  the phylogenetic level, except for malic enzymes of yeast and escherichia coli which were nearer the malolactic enzymes than the other malic enzymes. the analysis of conserved sites showed several interesting amino acids specific to either malic enzyme or malolactic enzyme.

AB  == a physical map of the chromosome of oenococcus oeni psu-1 was constructed. this represents the first map for a strain of this species. a total of 37 restriction  sites for the rare-cutting endonucleases ascl, fsel, notl and sfil were mapped on the chromosome, which was found to be circular with an estimated size of 1857 kb. fragment order was determined using several approaches: analysis of partial and double digestions, two-dimensional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, isolation of linking clones, and southern hybridization with labelled restriction fragments both from psu-1 and from o. oeni strain gm. oenococcal genes alss/alsd, mlea and  mir, two phage attachment sites and recurrent sequences such as is1165-like elements and rrn loci were located on the physical map. specific fragments hybridizing with gene probes from lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and bacillus subtilis were also identified. the two ribosomal operons have been precisely located and their transcription direction determined.

TI  == species attribution and strain typing of oenococcus oeni (formerly leuconostoc oenos) with restriction endonuclease fingerprints.
AB  == in several wines, malolactic fermentation is required to improve the organoleptic characters and to stabilize the final product. in order to establish a controlled malolactic fermentation in wine, easy identification and sensitive typing of strains of oenococcus oeni (new name of the malolactic bacterium leuconostoc oenos) used as starter cultures are necessary. to accomplish these tasks, several strains of oenococcus oeni isolated from wines of the chianti region (italy), along with reference strains and strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, l. carnosum, l. fallax, l. pseudomesenteroides, l. lactis and weisella paramesenteroides, were studied with rflp of ribosomal genes and ultrasensitive total dna restriction pattern analysis performed on polyacrylamide gel. with each of four restriction endonucleases used, identical restriction profiles of ribosomal genes were obtained for all strains of o. oeni. these ribopatterns, being strongly dissimilar to profiles of the other lactic acid bacteria tested, appear to be well suited for the attribution of wine lactic acid bacteria to the species o. oeni. cluster analysis performed on two total dna restriction profile data sets showed that the species o. oeni possesses a good degree of genomic homogeneity. very sensitive typing of strains of o. oeni was obtained with total dna restriction profiles. the potential of an integrated approach using restriction profiles for species assignment and typing of selected malolactic bacteria is demonstrated.
