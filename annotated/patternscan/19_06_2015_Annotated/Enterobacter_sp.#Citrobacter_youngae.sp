TI  == distribution of chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculant-producing potential in the genus citrobacter.
AB  == some strains belonging to the genera citrobacter and enterobacter have been reported to produce chitin/chitosan-like bioflocculants (bfs) from acetate. in this study, to investigate the distribution of the bf-producing potential in the  genus citrobacter and to screen stably and highly bf-producing strains, we obtained 36 citrobacter strains from different culture collection centers, which  were distributed among seven species in the genus, and tested for the flocculating activities of their culture supernatants using a kaolin suspension method. as a result, 21 strains belonging to c. freundii (17 strains in 23 strains tested), c. braakii (two in two), c. youngae (one in one), and c. werkmanii (one in two) showed flocculating activity, but this ability was limited to cells grown on acetate. gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) analysis  of the hydrolysates from the bfs of five selected strains indicated that they consisted of glucosamine and/or n-acetylglucosamine, such as the chitin/chitosan-like bf (bf04) produced by citrobacter sp. tkf04 (fujita et al. j biosci bioeng 89: 40-46, 2000). gel filtration chromatography using a high-performance liquid chromatography system revealed that the molecular weight  ranges of these bfs varied, but the average sizes were all above 1.66 x 10(6)da.
