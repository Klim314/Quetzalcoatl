TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == ecological competition and the incidence of acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in southeastern brazil.
AB  == introduction: recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (hais). acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause hais.  it is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii infection. methods: we conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (ha-bsis) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in brazil. ha-bsis were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered  from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. monthly incidence rates were calculated for all ha-bsis (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). multivariate poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii. results: the overall incidence rate of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. in the multivariate analysis, the incidence of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of ha-bsi due to staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [rr]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [ci]=0.80-0.97), enterobacter spp. (rr=0.84; 95%ci=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of ha-bsis. it would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.

TI  == microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  == high-pressure processing (300 mpa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. high-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and enterobacteriaceae count. molecular characterization studies revealed that enterobacter amnigenus and enterobacter sp. in control and bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus gallinarum and acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.

TI  == are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  == background: hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. methods: cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in brooklyn, ny. as a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr method. results: of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. cephalosporin-resistant citrobacter freundii (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 2), and enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not  from control sites. one isolate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated vim-2. acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6  miles (p = .004). eleven a baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr and were also related to a known clinical isolate. conclusions: strains of a baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand  cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. the finding of integron-associated vim-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further  vigilance is warranted.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential pcr gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  == aims: to verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., klebsiella sp., acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus,  enterobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus sp., candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. methods and results: clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the university of california, davis medical center (ucdmc) microbiology laboratory. five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. dna extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), ac. baumannii (57%) and ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). all clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two ac. baumannii, two klebsiella oxytoca and two candida parapsilosis isolates. conclusions: sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex late-pcr assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. the multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with dna extracted from 70 different target strains. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the potential of late-pcr to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == gram-negative osteomyelitis: clinical and microbiological profile.
AB  == introduction: despite the growing interest in the study of gram-negative bacilli  (gnb) infections, very little information on osteomyelitis caused by gnb is available in the medical literature. objectives and methods: to assess clinical and microbiological features of 101 cases of osteomyelitis caused by gnb alone, between january 2007 and january 2009, in a reference center for the treatment of high complexity traumas in the city of sao paulo. results: most patients were men (63%), with median age of 42 years, affected by chronic osteomyelitis (43%) or acute osteomyelitis associated to open fractures (32%), the majority on the lower limbs (71%). the patients were treated with antibiotics as inpatients for 40 days (median) and for 99 days (median) in outpatient settings. after 6 months follow-up, the clinical remission rate was around 60%, relapse 19%, amputation 7%, and death 5%. nine percent of cases were lost to follow-up. a total of 121 gnb was isolated from 101 clinical samples. the most frequently isolated pathogens were enterobacter sp. (25%), acinetobacter baumannii (21%) e pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). susceptibility to carbapenems was about 100% for enterobacter sp., 75% for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 60% for acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: osteomyelitis caused by gnb remains a serious therapeutic  challenge, especially when associated to nonfermenting bacteria. we emphasize the need to consider these agents in diagnosed cases of osteomyelitis, so that an ideal antimicrobial treatment can be administered since the very beginning of the therapy.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

TI  == prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico: special focus on acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico over a 3-year period. clinical isolates of a. baumannii (n = 550), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of a.  baumannii, 40% of escherichia coli, 34% of p. aeruginosa, 22% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of a. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. a. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. species from enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. for p. aeruginosa,  the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. with regard to s. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). the high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.

TI  == novel insights about class 2 integrons from experimental and genomic epidemiology.
AB  == in order to contribute to the knowledge of the architecture and epidemiology of class 2 integrons, we performed a class 2 integron molecular survey in which we analyzed 726 isolates in two bacterial populations from environmental and nonepidemiologically related clinical samples, respectively, collected from 1982  to 2007. we recovered the inti2 gene from 130 of 726 isolates, most of which were clinical isolates, and only 1 (a psychrophilic pseudomonas sp.) was from a water  sample. unlike the widespread distribution of class 1 integrons within gram-negative bacilli, only acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae harbored class 2 integrons at a high frequency in our collection. class 2 integrons with six novel cassette arrays were documented. characterization of the transposition module of tn7, the genetic platform in which class 2 integrons have always been reported, showed tns modules with a mosaic genetic structure. a bioinformatic analysis performed with the tns genes present in sequence databases, the finding of inti2 not associated with tns genes, and the genetic examination of novel tns-like genes found in three isolates indicated the possibility of the independent evolution of the two components related to horizontal gene transfer, the class 2 integrons and the tn7 transposons.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. five university clinics and/or regional hospitals in the slovak republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (19%), staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli (13.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter sp. all cons and s. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the cons and only for 4% of s. aureus isolates. a higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in cons in comparison to s. aureus. enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against e. coli. although 17% of k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against k. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against p. aeruginosa.

AB  == a prospective study was conducted from june 2001 to may 2002 at the burns unit of hospital regional da asa norte, brasilia, brazil. during the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the burns unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and  microbiologically proven sepsis. twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body  surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. these 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to candida sp. the most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. the primary  foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. the most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. the most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia,  leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. twelve (24.5%) patients died. the appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.

TI  == [kinetics of bactericidal activity of cefepime and cefpirome alone or combined with gentamicin, amikacin or ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter cloacae hyperproductive in cephalosporinase].
AB  == nosocomial infections encountered in intensive care units are frequently due to gram negative bacilli among which stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter sp., and enterobacter sp. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the new broad spectrum cephalosporins cefepime (fep) and cefpirome (cpo) alone or in combination with amikacin (akn), gentamicin (gtn) or ciprofloxacin (cip) against acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter cloacae producing a derepressed cephalosporinase. this study was performed by using the time-kill curve method on 24 h with a starting inoculum of 10(6) - 10(7) cfu/ml. the combination of fep (4 mg/l) with akn (4 mg/l) against a. baumanii only results in about 1 log decrease at 24 h, but when fep is combined at 8 mg/l, the decrease reaches 4 log in 24 h. the combination of fep (16 and 32 mg/l) clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) resulted in 3 log decrease at 24 h. when combined with cip 2 mg/l, fep (16 and 32 mg) resulted in 5 and 6 log decrease in 24 h respectively. there were no survival bacteria at 6 h when fep (32 mg/l) was combined with clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) and gtn (8 mg/l) at 6 h. used alone fep (1 mg/l) or cpo (1 mg/l) against e. cloacae, a 3 log decrease occurs at 6 h followed by a regrowth at 24 h. combined with akn (2 mg/l), fep (1  mg/l) results in a 6 log decrease at 24 h, when cpo at 2 mg/l is needed for an equivalent result. these data show synergistic bactericidal activity of both new  extended cephalosporins combined with akn, gtn or cip at concentrations achievable in biological fluid with adaptative dosage regimen.
