TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of Angelica archangelica L.  (Apiaceae) roots.
AB  - In this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Angelica archangelica L. (Apiaceae) roots from central Italy were analyzed. The major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). The oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. A weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with MIC values >4.0% v/v.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa (Apiaceae) from Italy.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa L. (Apiaceae) from central Italy were analyzed by GC/MS. The major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). The two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Candida albicans with MIC values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. A less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with MIC values higher than 4.0%, v/v.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in leukemic and solid-tumor cancer patients: distribution,  outcome and microbial spectrum of anaerobes.
AB  - AIMS: Nosocomial infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. As a result of their debilitated immune system, cancer patients are likely candidates for colonization with anaerobes. We sought to compare the distribution of nosocomial infections in neutropenic and non-neutropenic cancer patients and to calculate the associated mortality rates. MATERIAL & METHODS: This is the first study to demonstrate a complete microbial spectrum of anaerobes in various infection sites in hospitalized cancer patients. RESULTS: Frequencies of bloodstream infections (BSI), respiratory tract infections (RTI), and GI tract infections (GITI) were significantly higher in neutropenic cancer patients (p < 0.01). Conversely, urinary tract infection (UTI) and skin infection (SI) rates were significantly higher in non-neutropenic cancer patients (p < 0.01). Mortalities attributed to BSI, UTI, RTI, SI, and GITI occured at the respective percentage frequencies of 12.5%, 11.5%, 10.4%, 7.7% and 4.9%. Anaerobes constituted 4.7% of total isolates, and were recovered from SI (66.3%) and GITI (33.6%), but not respiratory tract, urine, or blood. Most anaerobes (79.2%) were isolated from solid-tumor patients. The most common infection in cancer patients was RTI (55.8%), mainly in leukemic patients, followed by SI (18%), only in solid-tumor patients, GITI (9.7%), BSI (9.4%), and UTI (7.1%). The most frequent isolates of Fusobacterium necrophorum (32.7%) and Eubacterium lentum (23.8%) were mostly recovered from solid-tumor patients. These were followed by Clostridium perfringens (11.9%), Clostridium difficile (10.9%), Eubacterium limosum (5.9%), and Veillonella parvula (5%). CONCLUSION: Control measures are needed to minimize risks of nosocomial infection outbreaks by anaerobes. Continuous monitoring of the presence of anaerobes in various infection sites in hospitalized cancer patients is needed in order to be able to provide the best supportive care for cancer patients.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
