TI  - [Diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (BF) on the surface of the implanted material. The majority of natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. However, there always only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. The aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of BF on endotracheal tube (ETT), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. METHOD: Thirty-five ETTs were obtained from 26 neonates on mechanical ventilator (from October 2012 to March 2013) in Department of Neonatology of Children's Hospital. Among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. DGGE profiling of 16S rDNA gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. TA Cloning Kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF. RESULT: The mean bands of 35 ETTs cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, and the mean Shanon-Wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. The 16 ETTs were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. The indwelling days of 6/7 patients' ETTs increased, the Shanon-siener indexes were decreased. Among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different Shanon-siener indexes. The result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained Klebsiella SP., 28 cases (80%) had Pseudomonas SP., 27 cases (77%) had Streptococcus SP., and 32 cases (91%) had Uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) Klebsiella SP. and 22/27(82%) Streptococcus SP. were accompanied by Pseudomonas SP.. There were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. Eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the ETTs on which Klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. CONCLUSION: The diversity of microbiota in BF on ETT was confirmed. 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of BF.
TI  - Prevalence of uropathogens in diabetic patients and their corresponding resistance pattern: results of a survey conducted at diagnostic centers in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infection is the second most common clinical indication for empirical antibiotic treatment in primary and secondary health care settings. The incidence of diabetes mellitus throughout the world is increasing strikingly and in the long run, it has some major effects on the genitourinary system which makes diabetic patients more liable to urinary tract infection. This study is designed to reveal the distribution of uropathogens in diabetic patients according to age and sex, and corresponding resistance patterns. METHODS: A six-month retrospective review of urine culture assay data from August 2009 to January 2010 from randomly selected 85 patients who suffered from both urinary tract infection and diabetes was conducted. Relevant information was retrieved and analyzed statistically using Microsoft(R) Excel 2002 software. RESULTS: The study showed that females are more vulnerable to pathogenic attack than males throughout a wide age distribution. In terms of pathogenic distribution, Escherichia coli was the highest followed by Streptococcus sp., Acinetobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae and few others. Though Meropenem showed no resistance with E. coli, Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae, in the case of Streptococcus sp. it exhibited resistance of 25%. Amikacin exhibited only 3% resistance with E. coli, whereas no resistance with Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and most interestingly showed 75% resistance with Streptococcus sp. Gentamicin exhibited no resistance with Acinetobacter while 26.9%, 50% and 87.5% resistance with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus sp. respectively. Hence, Nitrofurantoin exhibited less resistance 11.9% compared to 12.5% resistance with E. coli and Streptococcus sp. Nitrofurantoin was highly prone to resistance with Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae (100%, 50% respectively). Cephalosporins (cephradine, cefixime, ceftriaxone, cefepime etc.) showed moderate resistance (avg. 50%), whereas amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest resistance in all these cases. CONCLUSION: Pathogens are mostly resistant to antibiotics including amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin, with few exceptions including gentamicin, amikacin and meropenem.
TI  - Rational design of a plasmid origin that replicates efficiently in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most plasmids replicate only within a particular genus or family. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe an engineered high copy number expression vector, pBAV1K-T5, that produces varying quantities of active reporter proteins in Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, (all gram-negative), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Leifsonia shinshuensis, Peanibacillus sp. S18-36 and Bacillus subtilis (gram-positive). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate the efficiency of pBAV1K-T5 replication in different bacterial species, thereby facilitating the study of proteins that don't fold well in E. coli and pathogens not amenable to existing genetic tools.
TI  - [Usefulness and limit of Gram staining smear examination].
AB  - Gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. It yields results much faster than culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. However, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by Gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. Therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from Gram staining smears is also present. The Gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. Species of Gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. Gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. Even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive diplococcus, forming Gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling Streptococcus pneumoniae. Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in the sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, Gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling Haemophilus influenzae. Capnocytophaga sp. is a Gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling Fusobacterium nucleatum.
TI  - Role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - Eighty per cent of the cases of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) have an infective aetiology, atypical bacteria including Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounting for 5-10 % of these. However, the importance of association of M. pneumoniae with episodes of AECOPD still remains doubtful. The present study was therefore undertaken to delineate the extent of involvement of M. pneumoniae in patients with AECOPD at a referral hospital in Delhi, India. Sputum samples and throat swabs from a total of 100 AECOPD patients attending the Clinical Research Center of Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, Delhi, were collected during a 2-year period (January 2004-June 2006). The samples were investigated for the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens and M. pneumoniae. Diagnosis of infection with M. pneumoniae was based on culture, serology, direct detection of M. pneumoniae specific antigen and PCR. Bacterial aetiology could be established in 16 of the 100 samples studied. Pseudomonas spp. were recovered from eight cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae from four and Klebsiella spp. from two cases. Acinetobacter sp. and Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from one case each. Serological evidence of M. pneumoniae infection and/or detection of M. pneumoniae specific antigen were seen in 16 % of the cases. One case with definite evidence of M. pneumoniae infection also had coinfection with Pseudomonas spp. However, no direct evidence of M. pneumoniae infection was found in our study population as defined by culture isolation or PCR. In conclusion, although the serological prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection in our study population was significantly higher than in the control group, there was no direct evidence of it playing a role in AECOPD.
TI  - [Guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  - Patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop in patients already hospitalized in ICU especially in those requiring mechanical ventilation for different reasons. Within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in ICU, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by Legionella and Haemophilus. Pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. The most recent Canadian and American guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. In case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. Whenever a Pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). An anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. Early onset Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and early onset Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylocccus aureus e Gram negative enteric rods. These infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. Late onset VAP and HAP in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. The possible presence of MRSA or Legionella pneumophila suggests the use of anti-Gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. These quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.
TI  - Culture-proven bacterial keratitis in a Malaysian general hospital.
AB  - One hundred patients (101 eyes) with culture-proven bacterial keratitis were treated in the Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, over a 4-year period. The majority of patients was male (63%), Malay (60%), from the Johor Bahru district (62%) and aged between 41 to 50 years (20%). The ocular predisposing factors were ocular trauma (41 eyes), ocular surface disease (28 eyes) and contact lens wear (26 eyes). The corneal ulcers were mainly large (50.5%), central (59.4%) and colonized by Gram-negative bacteria (78.1%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (67 eyes), Staphylococcus aureus (12 eyes), Acinetobacter baumanii (6 eyes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5 eyes), Corynebacterium sp. (3 eyes:) and Streptococcus pneumonliae (3 eyes). Twelve eyes (11.8%) had polymicrobial infection. A good visual outcome occurred in 52.5% of eyes analysed. Prognostic factors for visual outcome include presenting Snellen visual acuity, time to presentation after onset of ocular symptoms, ocular predisposing factor, corneal ulcer location and corneal ulcer size.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Employment of broad-range 16S rRNA PCR to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16S rRNA PCR amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method for the rapid separation of 16S rRNA PCR amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples from 40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including Neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16S rRNA PCR in conjunction with PAGE and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific PCR employing ABI TaqMan technology for N. meningitidis. Analysis of clinical specimens employing 16S rRNA PCR yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial DNA. Species-specific PCR yielded 30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for N. meningitidis. Prior to separation by PAGE, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16S rRNA PCR amplicons. Following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for N. meningitidis and three specimens positive for Acinetobacter sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. One specimen was positive for both N. meningitidis and Streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for N. meningitidis and Pseudomonas sp., by broad-range PCR. Seven clinical specimens were negative for N. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant DNA. This study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16S rRNA PCR amplicons using a combination of PAGE and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. Adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16S rRNA PCR.
TI  - Distribution of mef(A) in gram-positive bacteria from healthy Portuguese children.
AB  - We screened 615 gram-positive isolates from 150 healthy children for the presence of the erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), erm(F), and mef(A) genes. The mef(A) genes were found in 20 (9%) of the macrolide-resistant isolates, including Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. Sixteen of the 19 gram-positive isolates tested carried the other seven open reading frames (ORFs) described in Tn1207.1, a genetic element carrying mef(A) recently described in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The three Staphylococcus spp. did not carry orf1 to orf3. A gram-negative Acinetobacter junii isolate also carried the other seven ORFs described in Tn1207.1. A Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a Streptococcus intermedius isolate, a Streptococcus sp. isolate, and an Enterococcus sp. isolate had their mef(A) genes completely sequenced and showed 100% identity at the DNA and amino acid levels with the mef(A) gene from S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - [A comparative study of antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin against clinical isolates].
AB  - Ceftibuten is an orally active third generation new cephalosporin. Its antibacterial activity in vitro was tested to many clinical isolates and was compared to the activity of ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin, by twofold serial dilution method in Muller-Hinton agar--detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and by the disc-diffusion method of Kirby-Bauer. The new cephalosporin demonstrated great activity against the different clinical important strains. Many resistant strains to ampicillin were high susceptible to ceftibuten. The majority of Gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacteriaceae, the respiratory pathogens M.(B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae are highly susceptible to Ceftibuten, however Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter are resistant. The majority of methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus are resistant too. New cephallosporin was also active against S. pyogenes (Streptococcus gr. A) and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, but was inactive against S. agalactiae (Streptococcus gr. B), S. pneumoniae penicillin-resistant strains and enterococci, similar to the other cephalosporins. The activity of ceftibuten was higher than that of ampicillin and cefuroxime against beta-lactamases positive strains of H. influenzae and M.(B) catarrhalis, also against tested strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The major priority of the new antibacterial agent over other cephalosporins and ampicillin is its stability to hydrolysis by the main broad-spectrum beta-lactamases producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae sp.
TI  - Significance of fever in Jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in Jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. DESIGN: Retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 September 1993 to 31 August 1996). SETTING: Sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in Kingston run by the Medical Research Council Laboratories (Jamaica). PATIENTS: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees C (102.4 degrees F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, death. RESULTS: There were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. Bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two Haemophilus influenzae type b, two Salmonella sp, one Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter sp, and one Acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. A painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). Hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. There were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with H influenzae septicaemia, and a 3 year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. Enteric Gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.
TI  - comB, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. BD413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  - Here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging ORFs in Acinetobacter sp.  BD413, namely lytB, orfY, orfX, comB, and orfZ, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comC. The N-termini of the deduced proteins OrfY and ComB exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein ComB is similar to type IV pilins. LytB is similar to the Escherichia coli LytB, which has been implicated in the stringent response. No homologues of OrfX, OrfY and OrfZ could be identified. A mutation in orfY or orfZ led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comB resulted in a non-competent phenotype. Disruption of lytB did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. Complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comB is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfY and orfZ mutants were due to polar effects on comB and comC, respectively. Analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comB mutant suggested that the competence gene comB is not essential for the biogenesis of type IV pili and expression of the type IV pili-associated property of twitching motility. Transcriptional fusions between comB and a promoter-free lacZ gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comB during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.
TI  - Identification and characterization of ComE and ComF, two novel pilin-like competence factors involved in natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413.
AB  - Although the high level of competence for natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 has been the subject of numerous studies, only two competence genes, comC and comP, have been identified to date. By chromosomal walking analysis we found two overlapping open reading frames, designated comE and comF, starting 61 bp downstream of comC. comE and comF are expressed as stable proteins in Escherichia coli, thus proving that they are indeed coding regions, but expression was successful only with 5'-deleted genes. ComE and ComF are similar to pilins and pilin-like components. Both genes were mutated, and the phenotypes of the mutants were analyzed. Natural transformation in comF mutants is 1,000-fold reduced, whereas comE mutants exhibit 10-fold-reduced transformation frequencies. This is clear evidence that comE and comF are involved in natural transformation. However, ComE and ComF are specific for DNA translocation, since comE and comF defects affected neither piliation nor lipase secretion. These results suggest that the type IV pili, the general protein secretion pathway, and the DNA translocation machinery in Acinetobacter sp. strain BD413 are evolutionary related but functionally distinct systems.
TI  - [Treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34 with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). Cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. The efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. The most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) Pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) Klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) E. coli; 2 (3.23%) Acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) Staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. The most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) S. aureus; 2 (5.88%) P. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) K. pneumoniae. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. Failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. Adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [The role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  - Carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of Staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. Meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. In abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. Treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (WSBL), cases of meningitis by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. Meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. The carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. In the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. Finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care units. The appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli, producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class I chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as Acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.
TI  - [Study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. Part 1. An analysis of causal organisms].
AB  - Causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to Jikei University Hospital from 1975 to 1994. Eighty patients (50.6%) were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. The average mortality rate was 18.4%. The mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. Staphylococcus aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), Escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and Haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). H. influenzae, Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group B streptococcus (GBS) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). The mortality rate of Klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), S. aureus (24.1%), S. pneumoniae (22.2%). H. influenzae and Acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. E. coli and GBS were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. H. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. Acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., and Acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. E. coli, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and GBS were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Community acquired pneumonia: aetiology and prognostic index evaluation.
AB  - A 10 month prospective study of all adults admitted to Waikato Hospital with community acquired pneumonia was performed to assess aetiology, mortality, hospital stay, and the value of a prognostic index based on that obtained from a British Thoracic Society study. The 92 patients in the survey had a mean age of 56 (range 13-97) years. A microbiological diagnosis was established in 72%; Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18%), and influenza A virus (8%) were the most common microorganisms. Other causative organisms were Legionella pneumophila (4 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Nocardia brasiliensis (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). Chlamydia sp, influenza B virus and adenovirus were each found in one case; all were cultured on nasopharygeal aspirates. Aspiration was considered to be the underlying cause in five patients, two with epilepsy and one with pseudobulbar palsy. Five of the six deaths that occurred were in patients over 75 years of age and the other was 69. In four of the six the established causative organisms were Chlamydia sp (1), K pneumoniae (1), and S aureus (2). Patients had a 16 fold increased risk of death if they had two or more of the following on admission: a respiratory rate of 30/minute or more, diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg or less, and either confusion or a plasma urea concentration greater than 7.0 mmol/l.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of sultamicillin in the treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Sultamicillin, a new semisynthetic oral beta-lactam antibiotic, was evaluated for its antibacteria susceptibility and clinical efficacy against urinary tract infection (UTI), and the following results were obtained. The sensitivity of sultamicillin (SBTPC) on 518 strains of clinical isolates from the urine were tested and compared to ampicillin (ABPC). S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii and Acinetobacter sp. showed high sensitivity to SBTPC. The antibacterial activity of SBTPC was superior to that of ABPC in most strains and especially more superior in beta-lactamase producing strains. The clinical effectiveness rate on a total of 15 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis was 93.3% and the eradication rate of causative organisms was 93.3%. On 15 patients with chronic complicated UTI, the clinical effectiveness rate was 73.3% and eradication rate was 76.5%. Side effects (diarrhea) were observed in 3 cases, but this symptom was not severe and soon disappeared. Abnormal laboratory data due to the drug were not observed.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Therapeutic effects of micronomicin against severe infections in patients with hematopoietic disorders. Hanshin Infection Study Group].
AB  - Micronomicin (MCR) at a daily dose of 120 to 360 mg was administered to patients  with severe infections who had hematopoietic disorders as underlying diseases. Efficacy and safety of the drug were evaluated. The underlying diseases in the 56 patients included in the evaluation of efficacy were acute myelocytic leukemia (24 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (8), acute promyelocytic leukemia (6), acute monomyelocytic leukemia (4), acute monocytic leukemia (1), erythroleukemia (1), chronic myelocytic leukemia-blastic crisis (4), malignant lymphoma (3), aplastic anemia (2), and others (3). The infections were septicemia in 9 patients, suspected septicemia in 48, respiratory tract infection in 7, and perianal abscess in 2. The clinical efficacy of MCR was 'excellent' in 12 patients, 'good' in 17, 'fair' in 7, 'poor' in 30 for an efficacy rate of 43.9%. The efficacy rate classified according to infections was 22.2% in septicemia, 56.3% in suspected septicemia. The organisms isolated from the patients with septicemia were Escherichia coli in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1, and Acinetobacter sp. in 1. The efficacy rate was 15.4% in the 13 patients whose causative organisms were identified. The efficacy rate for patients who had failed to respond to prior antibiotic therapy was 43.9%. The efficacy rate in patients (34 cases) with an initial neutrophil count less than 100/microliter was 44.1%. Side effect which might have been caused by MCR was skin eruption in only one episode among 83 episodes those were evaluated for safety.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - BB-K 122: in vitro and in vivo activity against ocular pathogens.
AB  - BB-K 122 is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic and an analogue of amikacin. This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of BB-K 122 and gentamicin against important ocular pathogens. BB-K 122 and gentamicin demonstrated generally equivalent in vitro antibacterial activity, except that gentamicin was more active against Streptococcus sp. BB-K 122 showed significant in vitro activity against important ophthalmic pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and species of Klebsiella, Escherichia, Proteus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella. Solutions of BB-K 122 (1%) and gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) were compared in an experimentally induced rabbit keratoconjunctivitis model. Rabbit eyes infected with P. aeruginosa or S. pneumoniae were treated with one of the two antibiotic formulations and evaluated after 24 h. A topical formulation of 1% BB-K 122 was at least as effective as gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) solution against these infections.
