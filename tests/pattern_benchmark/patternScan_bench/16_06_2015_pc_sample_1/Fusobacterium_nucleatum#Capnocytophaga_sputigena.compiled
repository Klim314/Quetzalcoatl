TI  - Phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  - The effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. Eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. Light with a power density of 70 mW/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. Dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. Microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard DNA probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. The proportions of black-pigmented species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. Five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. These species were Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena. At the same time, the percentage of gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. No adverse effects were found or reported in this study. The present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - A microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. METHODS: Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Tannerella forsythia, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria mucosa, Campylobacter gracilis, and Prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp space cases they were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, N. mucosa, E. faecalis, E. saburreum, C. gracilis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Counts of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Campylobacter sputigena, Capnocytophaga showae, Treponema socrenskii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp space cases.
TI  - Investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  - AIM: To investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens and Capnocytophaga sputigena. METHODOLOGY: Forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. Clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. Qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization (micro-IDent plus; Hain Lifescience, Germany). RESULTS: Extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for P. micra, F. nucleatum and C. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus C. rectus. Significant association was recorded between F. nucleatum-endo and P. micra-endo (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). There was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) C. sputigena-endo and C. sputigena-perio (P = 0.06, Fisher's exact test); (ii) P. micra-endo and P. micra-perio (P = 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with P. micra-endo (P = 0.03, Pearson chi-square test). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that F. nucleatum, P. micra and C. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.
TI  - Evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. METHODS: The study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the Philippe Pinel Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the CAGE (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (WHO). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (PD) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with PD < 4 mm. The presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed using the checkerboard technique. RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. However, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). Moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, F. nuc. nucleatum, Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, P. gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Tannerella forsythia at sites with PD < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). Of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented significantly higher mean levels of F. nuc. vincentii, F. nuc nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythia than sites with PD >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, SD+/-1.5). Forty species were identified by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. Periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. Implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. Neisseria mucosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. Implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of Eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, P<0.05), the levels of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, P<0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, P<0.05), and Micromonas micros (r=0.17, P=0.01). E. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (P<0.05). Subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (P<0.02) and N. mucosa (P<0.05). Independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of P. gingivalis (P<0.05), and Leptotrichia buccalis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.
TI  - Molecular identification of an invasive gingival bacterial community.
AB  - A woman with neutropenia developed gingival hyperplasia. Biopsy showed invasion of gingival tissue with mats of filamentous organisms, and molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed Capnocytophaga sputigena, Leptotrichia species, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Oral bacterial flora may cause invasive gingival disease with hyperplasia in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. Bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. The samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. The isolates were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), Eikenella corrodens (13.2%), Prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), Prevotella disiens (3.1%), Peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), Prevotella corporis (1.8%), Peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). No periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). The number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. It is concluded that the bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - The reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. We applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, P. nigrescens, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. Bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. Ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in the PMNL population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. Furthermore, the oxidative burst of PMNLs was detected in parallel assays using the dye DHR123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. We found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing PMNLs, ranging from 10.6% (strain W83) to > 99.4% (e.g. ATCC 33277T) in P. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain MH5) to > 95% (ATCC 33563T) in P. nigrescens. In contrast, almost all P. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. Comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding P. gingivalis strains suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.
TI  - Subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). Age was inversely associated with the GO. Plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with GO, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of GO. The gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the GO. Statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of GO were detected for Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium and Selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. Significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species Eubacterium alactolyticum, Campylobacter concisus, C. gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, F. mortiferum, F. nucleatum, and F. varium from the more enlarged lesions (GO >3).
TI  - Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-HCl.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-HCl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease in bacterial susceptibility. Twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. After subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-HCl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. The lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. The distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of minocycline-HCl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-HCl concentration equal to or less than the MIC for reference strains. However, some clinical strains of Prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. There were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. The concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.
TI  - Degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  - The degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. Fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. The degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by Capnocytophaga ochracea, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter sputorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Peptostreptococcus micros. All strains of P. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. The degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin C and albumin. The degradation by C. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. Furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. The present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. The presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.
TI  - [Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontic patients and susceptibility of these bacteria to minocycline-HCl].
AB  - The present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of Periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. Samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. After sampling, Periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. The detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution of the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. In view of the MIC of minocycline-HCI for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including Periocline. However, clinical strains of P. i. were considered to have low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. In view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. From these results, it was suggested that Periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-HCl.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - Aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  - Phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium OMIZ-W1. None of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas sputigena, Treponema pectinovorum, T. socranskii, or Wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methylester). Phenylalanine was essential for the growth of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium timidum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. With the exception of E. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic microorganisms to hypothiocyanite produced by lactoperoxidase.
AB  - The susceptibility of Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Eubacterium yurii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas sputigena, Wolinella recta to hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) produced by the lactoperoxidase system was tested. Results showed a decrease of bacterial survival rate after OSCN- exposure, with an intra- and inter-species variability from 0 to 95% for C. ochracea, 34-100% for E. corrodens, 0-83% for E. yurii, 1-15% for F. nucleatum, 8-61% for P. micros, 0-100% for P. intermedia, 0-44% for S. sputigena and 0-8% for W. recta. The survival rate did not correlate with the NADH/OSCN- oxidoreductase activity present in the lysed bacteria (r = -0.3248; N = 15; NS).
TI  - [Polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated effects on human oral keratinocytes by periodontopathic bacterial extracts].
AB  - In order to investigate the polymorphonuclear leukocyte-mediated oral keratinocyte injury, the author established a method to culture keratinocytes (SCC9 and gingival keratinocytes) and subjected to the cell detachment assay by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and/or bacterial ultrasonic extracts from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Bacteroides forsythus OMZ 408, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, Capnocytophaga sputigena 4 and Eikenella corrodens 1073. The bacterial extracts alone caused no cell disruption of the keratinocyte monolayers. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte alone caused only a minimal cell detachment. On the contrary, when the bacterial extracts were added to the co-culture of keratinocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, cell detachment of keratinocytes was observed except for the bacterial extract from Eikenella corrodens 1073. The effect of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 was the strongest. This effect was heat labile and not inhibited by polymyxin B. Cell detachment was inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin but not by catalase and superoxide dismutase. No keratinocyte lysis was observed in terms of 51Cr release. Hydrogen peroxide and leukocyte elastase also caused keratinocyte detachment. These results indicate that polymorphonuclear leukocyte can cause non-lytic cell detachment of the gingival keratinocytes when encountering some bacteria, which may lead to the increase of the permeability of the keratinocyte layers.
TI  - Use of synthetic oligonucleotide DNA probes for the identification of different strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. Probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the N-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum strain Fev1. Probe H 2.1, was a randomly cloned chromosomal DNA fragment of 2.1 kbp. The specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of Fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different oral species of six other genera. The chromosomal DNA of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes HincII, HindIII, EcoRI, EcoRV and Sau3AI. Digests were run on agarose gels and subjected to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. The results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic DNA from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe H 2.1. Probe H 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. By use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of F. nucleatum could be performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens and Leptotrichia buccalis. The probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus Fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.
TI  - Isolation and purification of bacteriocin from Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius).
AB  - Thirty-three out of 46 strains of Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. Thirteen isolates did not have the ability to inhibit the growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611. An inhibition factor from one of the isolates, P. intermedia TH14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. Bacteriocin TH14 activity was effective against only P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and Fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including P. intermedia ATCC 33563, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis), Capnocytophaga sputigena and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin TH14. Bacteriocin TH14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain ATCC 25611 in 15 minutes. The growth inhibition of P. intermedia ATCC 25611 by bacteriocin TH14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.
TI  - Microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  - Animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. The rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. Furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues with ligatures. Experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like Streptococcus sobrinus and Actinomyces viscosus are associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. Studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. Studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. However, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. In the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - Coaggregation of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas flueggei, Selenomonas infelix, Selenomonas noxia, and Selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-eight strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 Selenomonas strains, including S. sputigena (24 strains), S. flueggei (10 strains), S. infelix (5 strains), and S. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing Actinobacillus, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, Propionibacterium, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species. Selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with Actinomyces naeslundii PK984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. In contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. Each fusobacterium strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. Coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by EDTA, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. Likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. Heating the fusobacteria at 85 degrees C for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. Heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. Although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective. The strains of F. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. Collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. The contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.
TI  - Bactericidal concentrations of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel and  stannous fluoride gel for subgingival bacteria tested in serum at short contact times.
AB  - In vitro inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations in serum of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel, stannous fluoride gel, stannous fluoride, metronidazole and amoxicillin were determined against Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The minimal inhibitory concentration was assessed by the agar dilution technique. The killing curves and minimal bactericidal concentration of the antimicrobial agents in inactivated bovine serum were determined after 5, 10, 20 and 60 minutes contact time. The minimal inhibitory concentration varied amongst the tested bacteria. A concentration of 128 micrograms/ml chlorhexidine digluconate, 20 mg/ml amine fluoride gel, 1 mg/ml stannous fluoride, 128 micrograms/ml metronidazole and 4 micrograms/ml amoxicillin inhibited the growth of the tested species. The minimal bactericidal concentration in serum for B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena after 10 min contact time was 5 mg/ml for chlorhexidine digluconate and 100 mg/ml for amine fluoride gel. A concentration of 200 mg/ml stannous fluoride gel in serum was bactericidal for the tested species after 10 min contact time, with exception of F. nucleatum.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - Assessment of serum antibody patterns and analysis of subgingival microflora of members of a family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - In a study of members of a large family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis, we sampled the subgingival microflora and characterized 40 isolates from each sample. We surveyed serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies reacting with any of a panel of 21 periodontal bacteria. The mother and 7 of her 13 children had early-onset periodontitis. Bacteroides gingivalis was not detected in the subgingival flora of any affected or unaffected family member, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from only one affected child. Capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated from five of seven affected children and from none of their normal siblings. We found no significant differences among the floras from family members who had rapidly progressive, juvenile, and prepubertal forms of periodontitis. Elevated levels of serum antibody reacting with one or more of the bacteria tested were found in all family members with disease, but in only one periodontally normal family member. Both children with prepubertal periodontitis had antibodies reacting with C. sputigena, a species not found in their subgingival floras, but with none of the other bacteria tested. All remaining affected family members had antibodies to one or more serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, and four had antibodies reacting with additional bacteria, including C. sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Haemophilus aphrophilus. Sera from patients contained antibodies specific for putative periodontal pathogens not found in their pocket flora, and conversely, putative periodontal pathogens for which no serum antibodies were found frequently comprised a large proportion (10% or more) of the pocket flora. In no case were both the bacterium and its antibody found. These observations are suggestive of sequential infection in the early-onset forms of periodontitis and of induction of protective immunity against reinfection by the same microorganism.
TI  - Survival analysis of periodontal sites before and after periodontal therapy.
AB  - Periodontal diseases appear to progress with bursts of destructive activity at individual sites. One effect of treatment might be to diminish the frequency of such bursts. Survival analysis was employed to seek such effects on the periodontal sites of 16 individuals with prior evidence of destructive periodontal disease. The subjects were monitored at bi-monthly intervals and actively breaking down sites were detected using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis. When active sites were detected, control sites of equal pocket depth and attachment loss were selected and microbiological and immunological samples were taken. The subjects were treated by modified Widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. On completion of therapy, bi-monthly monitoring was reinstituted. Life tables were constructed for periodontal sites in each of the 16 subjects prior to and after therapy. A site losing more than 3 mm of attachment at any time interval was considered to have relapsed or "died". Survivor functions were calculated for each time period indicating the % of sites which survived at any time. The subjects were divided into 3 categories on the basis of post-therapy survivor functions. The annual hazard rate in 9 good treatment response subjects (group 1) was reduced from 0.10/year to 0.01/year. The hazard rate of 5 intermediate treatment response subjects (group 2A) was reduced from 0.16/year to 0.04/year and that of 2 poor treatment response subjects (group 2B) from 0.15/year to 0.07/year. Group 2A and 2B individuals were combined and differences were sought in clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters between the good and poor treatment response groups. 5 out of 7 of the poor responding individuals showed elevated humoral antibody responses to 3 or more gram-negative subgingival species tested. Many of the elevated responses in this group were to organisms which are widely distributed and return quickly after therapy such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides intermedius and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The predominant cultivable microbiota in subgingival samples taken prior to therapy from the good responding group had significantly greater proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea and B. intermedius than the poor responding group. The latter group showed significantly elevated proportions of F. nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. The subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. Using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. Active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. The control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. Bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. Similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. The proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of Bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. sputigena and Eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of B. intermedius and E. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species had increased. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. The proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis II and Campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. Humoral antibody response to A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena significantly increased in a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. Antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. Crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Polyclonal B-cell activation induced by extracts of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from periodontally diseased sites.
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine whether gram-negative bacteria frequently isolated from periodontally diseased sites contained polyclonal B-cell activators. Polyclonal B-cell activation, which results in nonspecific activation of multiple B-cell clones was analyzed by a hemolysis-in-gel assay designed to detect a broad range of antibody specificities. Extracts from numerous bacterial strains, including Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas sputigena, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were tested. Extracts of the above organisms were found to stimulate polyclonal antibody responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, although the magnitude of stimulation varied among the extracts. Optimal antibody-forming cell responses were found at stimulator doses between 5 and 1,000 micrograms/ml. We conclude that the resident gram-negative subgingival flora associated with periodontal lesions possesses potent polyclonal B-cell activators. These activators may contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing B lymphocytes to produce antibody, osteolytic factors, or both and possibly other mediators of inflammation.
TI  - Capnocytophaga: new genus of gram-negative gliding bacteria. III. Physiological characterization.
AB  - Sixty-eight strains of capnophilic fusiform Gram-negative rods from the human oral cavity were subjected to extensive physiologic characterization, tested for susceptibility to various antibiotics, and the mol-percent guanine plus cytosine of each isolate determined. The characteristics of the isolates were compared with 10 fresh and 2 stock isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The isolates clearly differed from the Fusobacterium species on the basis of mol-percent guanine plus cytosine, end products, growth in a capnophilic environment and fermentation of carbohydrates. All of the gliding isolates required CO2 and formed acetate and succinate, but not H2S, indole or acetylmethylcarbinol. All fermented glucose, sucrose, maltose and mannose. The organisms may be differentiated on the basis of fermentation of additional carbohydrates, hydrolysis of polymers and reduction nitrate. Three species are proposed: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. Ten isolates did not fit into the proposed species.
