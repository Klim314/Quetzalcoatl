TI  == mother-to-infant transmission of intestinal bifidobacterial strains has an impact on the early development of vaginally delivered infant's microbiota.
AB  == objectives: bifidobacterium species are one of the major components of the infant's intestine microbiota. colonization with bifidobacteria in early infancy  is suggested to be important for health in later life. however, information remains limited regarding the source of these microbes. here, we investigated whether specific strains of bifidobacteria in the maternal intestinal flora are transmitted to their infant's intestine. materials and methods: fecal samples were collected from healthy 17 mother and infant pairs (vaginal delivery: 12; cesarean section delivery: 5). mother's feces were collected twice before delivery. infant's feces were collected at 0 (meconium), 3, 7, 30, 90 days after  birth. bifidobacteria isolated from feces were genotyped by multilocus sequencing typing, and the transitions of bifidobacteria counts in infant's feces were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr. results: stains belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, were identified to be monophyletic between mother's and infant's intestine. eleven out of 12 vaginal delivered infants carried at least one monophyletic strain. the bifidobacterial counts of the species to which the monophyletic strains belong, increased predominantly in the infant's intestine within 3 days after birth. among infants delivered by c-section, monophyletic strains were not observed. moreover, the bifidobacterial counts were significantly lower than the vaginal delivered infants until 7 days of age. conclusions: among infants born vaginally, several bifidobacterium strains transmit from the mother and colonize the infant's intestine shortly after birth. our data suggest that the mother's intestine is an important source for the vaginal delivered infant's intestinal microbiota.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == long-term changes in human colonic bifidobacterium populations induced by a 5-day oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the possible modifications due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc) treatment on total bacteria and on bifidobacterium species balance in human colonic microbiota. eighteen healthy volunteers (19 to 36 years old) were given a 875/125 mg dose of amc twice a day for 5 days. fecal samples were obtained before and after antibiotic exposure. after total dna extraction, total bacteria and bifidobacteria were specifically quantified using real-time pcr. dominant species were monitored over time using bacterial and bifidobacterial temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). at the end of amc exposure, total bacterial concentrations as well as bifidobacteria concentrations were significantly reduced compared to before amc exposure:10.7+/-0.1 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 11.1+/-0.1 log(10) (p = 0.003) and 8.1+/-0.5 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 9.4+/-0.3 log(10) (p = 0.003), respectively. at the same time, the mean similarity percentages of ttge bacteria and ttge bifidobacteria profiles were significantly reduced compared to  before amc exposure: 51.6%+/-3.5% vs 81.4%+/-2.1% and 55.8%+/-7.6% vs 84.5%+/-4.1%, respectively. occurrence of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum and b. pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum species significantly decreased. occurrence of b. longum remained stable. moreover, the number of distinct bifidobacterium species per sample significantly decreased (1.5+/-0.3 vs 2.3+/-0.3; p = 0.01). two months after amc exposure, the mean similarity percentage of ttge profiles was 55.6% for bacteria and 62.3% for bifidobacteria. these results clearly demonstrated that a common antibiotic treatment may qualitatively alter the colonic microbiota. such modifications may have potential long-term physiological consequences.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == secretor genotype (fut2 gene) is strongly associated with the composition of bifidobacteria in the human intestine.
AB  == intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health, and its composition is determined by several factors, such as diet and host genotype. however, thus far it has remained unknown which host genes are determinants for the microbiota composition. we studied the diversity and abundance of dominant bacteria and bifidobacteria from the faecal samples of 71 healthy individuals. in this cohort, 14 were non-secretor individuals and the remainders were secretors.  the secretor status is defined by the expression of the abh and lewis histo-blood group antigens in the intestinal mucus and other secretions. it is determined by  fucosyltransferase 2 enzyme, encoded by the fut2 gene. non-functional enzyme resulting from a nonsense mutation in the fut2 gene leads to the non-secretor phenotype. pcr-dgge and qpcr methods were applied for the intestinal microbiota analysis. principal component analysis of bifidobacterial dgge profiles showed that the samples of non-secretor individuals formed a separate cluster within the secretor samples. moreover, bifidobacterial diversity (p<0.0001), richness (p<0.0003), and abundance (p<0.05) were significantly reduced in the samples from the non-secretor individuals as compared with those from the secretor individuals. the non-secretor individuals lacked, or were rarely colonized by, several genotypes related to b. bifidum, b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum/pseudocatenulatum. in contrast to bifidobacteria, several bacterial genotypes were more common and the richness (p<0.04) of dominant bacteria as detected by pcr-dgge was higher in the non-secretor individuals than in the secretor individuals. we showed that the diversity and composition of the human bifidobacterial population is strongly associated with the histo-blood group abh  secretor/non-secretor status, which consequently appears to be one of the host genetic determinants for the composition of the intestinal microbiota. this association can be explained by the difference between the secretor and non-secretor individuals in their expression of abh and lewis glycan epitopes in  the mucosa.

TI  == amoxicillin treatment modifies the composition of bifidobacterium species in infant intestinal microbiota.
AB  == objectives: amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic largely used in childhood. however only few studies described its impact on composition of children gut microbiota, in particular on bifidobacterium populations considered as beneficial microorganisms. in this study, the impact on faecal bifidobacterium species of a  seven-day amoxicillin treatment was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in  infants during an episode of acute respiratory infection. methods: faecal samples from 31 infants were obtained on day 0 (just before amoxicillin therapy) and on day 7 (the end of therapy). total dna was extracted and bifidobacteria were quantified using real-time pcr. predominant bifidobacterium species were then identified using specific pcr-ttge. results: bifidobacteria concentrations were not significantly altered by amoxicillin compared to the healthy group. however,  amoxicillin treatment induced a complete disappearance of bifidobacterium adolescentis species (occurrence rate of 0% versus 36.4% in healthy group, p < 0.001), a significant decrease in the occurrence rate of bifidobacterium bifidum  (23% versus 54.5% in healthy group, p < 0.05), but did not affect bifidobacterium longum (93.5% versus 100% in healthy group) and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum (about 55% in both groups). the number of bifidobacterium species per microbiota significantly decreased from 2.5 +/- 1 for healthy group to 1.8 +/- 0.9 for treated infants (p < 0.05). conclusions: this study showed that a 7 day amoxicillin treatment did not alter the counts of bifidobacterium. however amoxicillin can have an impact by changing the microbiota at the species level and decreased the diversity of this population.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == relationship between the resistance to bile salts and low ph with exopolysaccharide (eps) production of bifidobacterium spp. isolated from infants  feces and breast milk.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible relation between resistance to bile salts and low ph with exopolysaccharide (eps) producing of bifidobacterium spp. in this study, a total of 31 bifidobacterium spp. were isolated from breast fed infants feces and breast milk samples. as a result of the identification tests, isolates were identified as bifidobacterium breve (15 strains), b. bifidum (11 strains), b. pseudocatenulatum (3 strains) and b. longum (2 strains). bifidobacterium spp. were determined exopolysaccharide (eps) production. eps productions observed at chance rations (38.00-97.64 mg/l) among of bifidobacterium spp. furthermore, bifidobacterium spp. were determined resistance to bile salts and low ph. positive correlations between production of  exopolysaccharide and resistance to bile salts (p<0.01) or low ph (p<0.01) were found bifidobacterium spp. this investigation showed that high eps production of  bifidobacteria may be important in the selection of probiotic strains for resistance to bile salts and low ph.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

TI  == comparison of intestinal microflora in healthy infants and infants with allergic  colitis.
AB  == twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific fish probe. infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. in healthy infants, bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by b. adolescentis (20.0), b. breve (18.2), b. bifidum (16.4), b. dentium (10.9) and b. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). bifidobacterial isolates from  two babies with allergic colitis were identified as b. longum, one child from patients group contained species b. dentium and one baby b. adolescentis. our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum is associated with atopic eczema: a nested case-control study investigating the fecal microbiota of infants.
AB  == background: exposure to specific bacterial bowel commensals may increase/reduce the risk of atopic diseases. objective: to compare fecal bacterial communities of young infants with/without eczema. methods: nested case-control study. infants age 3 to 6 months with eczema (cases, n = 37) and without (controls, n = 24) were matched for sex, age, feeding (breast/bottle/mixed/solids), ethnicity. information was collected on maternal/infant antibiotic exposure, feeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, family history of allergy. eczema severity scoring was used (severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index). samples were taken for determination of allergen-specific serum ige (cases) and urinary/fecal eosinophilic protein x. gastrointestinal permeability was measured. the compositions of fecal bacterial communities were analyzed (culture-independent, nucleic acid-based analyses). results: there was no difference in overall profiles of fecal bacterial communities between cases and controls. family history of allergy increased likelihood of bifidobacteria detection (history, 86%; no history, 56%; p = .047); breast-fed infants were more likely to harbor bifidobacterium bifidum (odds ratio, 5.19; 95% ci, 1.47-18.36; p = .01). bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum was detected more commonly in feces of non-breast-fed children (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% ci, 1.3-24.3; p = .02) and children with eczema (eczema, 26%; no eczema, 4%; p = .04). there were no significant associations between clinical measurements and detection of b pseudocatenulatum.  conclusion: presence of b pseudocatenulatum in feces was associated with eczema and with exclusive formula-feeding; b bifidum was associated with breast-feeding.

TI  == inhibitory impact of bifidobacteria on the transfer of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae in the gnotobiotic mouse digestive tract.
AB  == while looking for new means to limit the dissemination of antibiotic resistance,  we evaluated the role of potentially probiotic bifidobacteria on the transfer of  resistance genes between enterobacteria. transfers of bla genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (shv-5 and ctx-m-15) were studied in the absence or presence of bifidobacteria. in vitro, transfer frequencies of these bla genes decreased significantly in the presence of three of five tested strains, i.e., bifidobacterium longum cuetm-89-215, bifidobacterium bifidum cip-56.7t, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum cip-104168t. four transfer experiments were conducted in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice, the first  three observing the effect of b. longum cuetm-89-215, b. bifidum cip-56.7t, and b. pseudocatenulatum cip-104168t on blashv-5 transfer and the fourth experiment studying the effect of b. bifidum cip-56.7t on blactx-m-15 transfer. these experiments revealed significant decreases in the transconjugant levels (up to 3  logs) in mice having received b. bifidum cip-56.7t or b. pseudocatenulatum cip-104168t compared to control mice. bifidobacteria appear to have an inhibitory impact on the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. the inhibitory effect is associated to specific bifidobacterial strains and may be related to the production of thermostable metabolites by these strains.

TI  == [analysis of bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut via temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge)].
AB  == temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling was used to analyze bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut in this study. bifidobacteria group-specific tgge patterns of 10 healthy human individuals showed that the bifidobacteria population in humans was host-specific. the genomic diversity and species composition of bifidobacteria in different individual was dissimilar. through sequencing and tgge comigration analysis of the bifidobacteria group-specific amplicons for one healthy boy, it was revealed that the tgge bands of this individual represented species bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. pseudocatenulatum and one potentially new species, respectively. b. pseudocatenulatum was the most common species of tested samples. while as control, only two species- b. pseudocatenulatum and b. longum were isolated using traditional culture method. bifidobacteria group-specific pcr based tgge method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling is a sensitive and effective approach to resolve the population structure of bifidobacteria in microflora of human intestinal tract.

TI  == conditions affecting cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == the cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria have been characterized for 30 strains isolated from a fecal sample. strain identification  to the species level was obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified 16s rrna gene and confirmed by dna/dna reassociation experiments. the isolates were grouped in four genetically homogeneous clusters whose members belonged to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum species. cell surface properties of bifidobacterium strains were evaluated by determining the level of hydrophobicity, adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements, and their autoaggregation ability. the results showed high and homogeneous level of hydrophobicity in all tested strains when contact angle measurements values were  considered. on the contrary, autoaggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons detected interesting differences in cell surface properties among the tested bifidobacterium strains. the highest levels of autoaggregation, detected in b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains, were strictly dependent on the ph of the medium. moreover, protease treatment experiments suggested that proteins had a key role in the autoaggregating ability of b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == bifidobacterial species differentially affect expression of cell surface markers  and cytokines of dendritic cells harvested from cord blood.
AB  == the gut microbiota may be important in the postnatal development of the immune system and hence may influence the prevalence of atopic diseases. bifidobacteria  are the most numerous bacteria in the guts of infants, and the presence or absence of certain species could be important in determining the geographic incidence of atopic diseases. we compared the fecal populations of bifidobacteria from children aged 25 to 35 days in ghana (which has a low prevalence of atopy),  new zealand, and the united kingdom (high-prevalence countries). natal origin influenced the detection of bifidobacterial species in that fecal samples from ghana almost all contained bifidobacterium infantis whereas those of the other children did not. choosing species on the basis of our bacteriological results, we tested bifidobacterial preparations for their effects on cell surface markers  and cytokine production by dendritic cells harvested from cord blood. species-specific effects on the expression of the dendritic-cell activation marker cd83 and the production of interleukin-10 (il-10) were observed. whereas cd83 expression was increased and il-10 production was induced by bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, b. infantis failed to produce these effects. we concluded that b. infantis does not  trigger the activation of dendritic cells to the degree necessary to initiate an  immune response but that b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. pseudocatenulatum induce a th2-driven immune response. a hypothesis is presented to link our observations to the prevalence of atopic diseases in different countries.

TI  == enumeration, isolation, and identification of bifidobacteria from infant feces.
AB  == thirty-three fully breast-fed infants aged between 1 and 12 weeks were screened for bifidobacteria in feces. bifidobacteria counts in most fecal samples determined both by tpy agar and fish procedure ranged from 10(8) to 10(11) cfu/g. three infants did not contain any bifidobacteria in their fecal samples. one child was delivered by caesarean section and the other two by normal vaginal delivery. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia  using genus-specific fish probe. in bifidobacteria-positive samples, b. longum (57.9% of the samples) was the most frequently found species, followed by b. adolescentis (31.6%), b. bifidum (21.0%), b. breve (10.5%), b. pseudocatenulatum  (5.3%), and b. dentium (5.3%).

TI  == probiotic bifidobacteria protect mice from lethal infection with shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == the anti-infectious activity of probiotic bifidobacteria against shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 was examined in a fatal mouse stec infection model. stable colonization of the murine intestines was achieved by the oral administration of bifidobacterium breve strain yakult (naturally resistant to streptomycin sulfate) as long as the mice were treated with streptomycin in their drinking water (5 mg/ml). the pathogenicity of stec infection, characterized by marked body weight loss and subsequent death, observed in the infected controls was dramatically inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. moreover, stx production by stec cells in the intestine was almost completely inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. a comparison of  anti-stec activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance  to streptomycin revealed that strains such as bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 15696  and bifidobacterium catenulatum atcc 27539(t) did not confer an anti-infectious activity, despite achieving high population levels similar to those of effective  strains, such as b. breve strain yakult and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. the effective strains produced a high concentration of acetic acid (56 mm) and lowered the ph of the intestine (to ph 6.75) compared to the infected control group (acetic acid concentration, 28 mm; ph, 7.15); these effects were thought to be related to the anti-infectious activity of these strains because the combination of a high concentration of acetic acid and a low ph was found to inhibit stx production during stec growth in vitro.

TI  == multiplex pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  == three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) targeted on bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. the selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. three to four pairs were gathered in one pcr reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using dna from 26 reference strains. using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, b. bifidum, b. longum and b. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum continuum and b. longum species were predominant in adults. thus, a single pcr can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of pcr reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in dna extracts from  human stools.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == increased resistance of mice to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection by synbiotic administration of bifidobacteria and transgalactosylated oligosaccharides.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of bifidobacteria in combination with transgalactosylated oligosaccharides (tos) against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt-2 in an opportunistic antibiotic-induced murine infection model in mice was examined. methods and results: b. breve (strain yakult) with natural resistance to streptomycin sulphate (sm, mic: > 4 mg ml(-1)), when given daily at a dose of 108 cfu/mouse orally under sm treatment was constantly excreted at 10(10) cfu g(-1) faeces so long as sm was administered, even at 2 weeks after discontinuing administration of b. breve. explosive intestinal growth and subsequent extra-intestinal translocation of orally infected lt-2 under sm treatment were inhibited by b. breve colonization, and this anti-infectious activity was strengthened by synbiotic administration of tos with b. breve. comparison of anti-salmonella activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance to sm revealed that strains such as b. bifidum atcc 15696 and  b. catenulatum atcc 27539t conferred no activity, even when they reached high population levels similar those of effective strains such as strain yakult and b. pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. both the increase in the concentration of organic acids and the lowered ph in the intestine due to bifidobacterial colonization correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, the crude cecal extract of b. breve-colonized mice exerted growth-inhibitory activity against lt-2 in vitro, whereas that of the ineffective b. bifidum-colonized cecum showed much lower activity. conclusions: intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria given exogenously together with tos during antibiotic treatment prevents the antibiotic-induced disruption of colonization resistance to oral infection with s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and the metabolic activity needed to produce organic acids and lower the intestinal ph is important in the anti-infectious activity of synbiotics against enteric infection with salmonella. significance and impact of the study: these results indicate that certain bifidobacteria together with prebiotics may be used for the prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == adhesion of bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == twenty-four bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. no significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. among the tested bacteria, b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of b. animalis and  b. lactis was not preferential. these results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.

TI  == distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  == in order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific pcr technique was developed and used with dnas extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. to cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for bifidobacterium longum, b. infantis, b. dentium, and b. gallicum were developed and used with primers for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, and the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (t. matsuki, k. watanabe, r. tanaka, and h. oyaizu, fems microbiol. lett. 167:113-121, 1998). the specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by pcr, and the species-specific pcr method was found to be a useful means for identifying bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. the results of an examination  of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the b. catenulatum group was  the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by b. longum and b. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and  that b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. the present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.

TI  == degradation of complex carbohydrates by bifidobacterium spp.
AB  == two hundred and ninety strains of 29 species of bifidobacteria from human and animal origin were surveyed for their ability to ferment complex carbohydrates. the substrates fermented by the largest number of species were d-galactosamine, d-glucosamine, amylose and amylopectin. many of the species isolated from animal  habitats showed reduced fermentation activity. bifidobacterium dentium strains fermented gum guar and gum locust bean; porcine gastric mucin was fermented only  by b. bifidum, b. infantis was the only species to ferment d-glucuronic acid; strains of b. longum fermented arabinogalactan and the gums arabic, ghatti and tragacanth; alpha-l-fucose was fermented by strains of b. breve, b. infantis and  b. pseudocatenulatum. a key to the differentiation of bifidobacterium species of  human origin is provided.
