TI  - Cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) by pyrosequencing and to document associations between cervical microbiota, cervical inflammatory response, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), histological chorioamnionitis, and intraamniotic infection (IAI). STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-one women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM were included in the study. Specimens of cervical and amniotic fluid were collected on admission. The cervical microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing by pyrosequencing. Interleukin (IL)-6 concentration in the cervical fluid and amniotic fluid was measured by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay, respectively. RESULTS: Four bacterial community state types [CST I (Lactobacillus crispatus dominated), CST III (Lactobacillus iners dominated), CST IV-A (non-Lactobacillus bacteria dominated), and CST IV-B (Gardnerella vaginalis and Sneathia sanguinegens dominated)] were observed in the cervical microbiota of women with PPROM. Cervical fluid IL-6 concentrations differed between CSTs (CST I = 145 pg/mL, CST III = 166 pg/mL, CST IV-A = 420 pg/mL, and CST IV-B = 322 pg/mL; p = 0.004). There were also differences in the rates of MIAC, of both MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis, and of IAI among CSTs. No difference in the rate of histological chorioamnionitis was found among CSTs. CONCLUSIONS: The cervical microbiota in PPROM women in this study was characterized by four CSTs. The presence of non-Lactobacillus CSTs was associated with a strong cervical inflammatory response and higher rates of MIAC, both MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis, and IAI representing a PPROM subtype with pronounced inflammation. CST I represents the dominant type of PPROM with a low rate of MIAC, IAI, and the combination of MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis.
TI  - Diagnosing inflammation and infection in the urinary system via proteomics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current methodology for the diagnosis of diseases in the urinary system includes patient symptomology, urine analysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria from urethral colonization or indwelling catheters, sample contamination from perineal or vaginal sources, and non-infectious inflammatory conditions can mimic UTIs, leading to uncertainty on medical treatment decisions. METHODS: Innovative shotgun metaproteomic methods were used to analyze urine sediments from 120 patients also subjected to conventional urinalysis for various clinical reasons including suspected UTIs. The proteomic data were simultaneously searched for the presence of microbial agents, inflammation, immune responses against pathogens, and evidence of urothelial tissue injury. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to identify host protein patterns discerning UTI from urethral colonization and vaginal contamination of urine samples. RESULTS: Organisms causing more than 98% of all UTIs and commensal microbes of the urogenital and perineal area were identified from 76 urine sediments with detection sensitivities estimated to be similar to urine culture. Proteomic data permitted a thorough evaluation of inflammatory and antimicrobial immune responses. Hierarchical clustering of the data revealed that high abundances of proteins from activated neutrophils were associated with pathogens in most cases, and correlated well with leukocyte esterase activities and leukocyte counts via microscopy. Proteomic data also allowed assessments of urothelial injury, by quantifying proteins highly expressed in red blood cells and contributing to the acute phase response. Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis were frequently identified suggesting urethral colonization and/or vaginal contamination of urine. CONCLUSIONS: A metaproteomic approach of interest for routine urine clinical diagnostics is presented. As compared to urinalysis and urine culture methods, the data are derived from a single experiment for a given sample and provide additional insights into presence or absence of inflammatory responses and vaginal contamination of urine specimens.
TI  - The significance of Lactobacillus crispatus and L. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of African women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women in sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to acquiring HIV infection and reproductive tract infections. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a disruption of the vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with HIV infection. Risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are not known. METHODS: We present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the Lactobacillus genus, five Lactobacillus species, and three BV-related bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Prevotella bivia) together with Escherichia coli and Candida albicans in 426 African women across different groups at risk for HIV. We selected a reference group of adult HIV-negative women at average risk for HIV acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, HIV-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of HIV-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. We explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with BV by Nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. RESULTS: The presence of species across Kenyan, South African and Rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in Kenya and South Africa. The Rwandan sex workers and HIV-positive women had the highest G. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). Pregnant women had a higher Lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). L. vaginalis (43%) was second to L. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal Nugent score. Recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of L. crispatus (<0.001), L. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and Lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). Having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of G. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and L. iners (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the composition of species across the studied African countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. L. crispatus and L. vaginalis in women with a normal Nugent score appeared lower compared to non-African studies. Furthermore, Lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. Strategies to support protective Lactobacillus species are urgently needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at the Trial Registration at the National Health Research Ethics Council South Africa with the number DOH2709103223.
TI  - Complementary seminovaginal microbiome in couples.
AB  - The genital tract microbiome is tightly associated with reproductive health. Although many research studies have been performed on the vaginal microbiome, current knowledge of the male microbiome is scarce, and parallel studies examining couples are extremely rare. In this work, we aimed to compare seminal and vaginal microbiomes in couples and to assess the influence of sexual intercourse on vaginal microbiome. The study included 23 couples. Microbiomes of semen and vaginal fluid (pre- and post-intercourse) were profiled using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing of the V6 region of 16S rRNA gene. Seminal communities were significantly more diverse, but with lower total bacterial concentrations than those of the vagina. Gardnerella vaginalis was predominant in half of the women whose partners had significant leukocytospermia, but only in one of 17 women who had a partner without leukocytospermia. There was significant decrease in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus after intercourse, and high concordance between semen and vaginal samples. Our data support the hypothesis that semen and vaginal microbiomes are in association, inasmuch as the predominance of G. vaginalis in female partners was significantly related to inflammation in male genital tracts.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota of adolescent girls prior to the onset of menarche resemble those of reproductive-age women.
AB  - Puberty is an important developmental stage wherein hormonal shifts mediate the physical and physiological changes that lead to menarche, but until now, the bacterial composition of vaginal microbiota during this period has been poorly characterized. We performed a prospective longitudinal study of perimenarcheal girls to gain insight into the timing and sequence of changes that occur in the vaginal and vulvar microbiota during puberty. The study enrolled 31 healthy, premenarcheal girls between the ages of 10 and 12 years and collected vaginal and vulvar swabs quarterly for up to 3 years. Bacterial composition was characterized by Roche 454 pyrosequencing and classification of regions V1 to V3 of 16S rRNA genes. Contrary to expectations, lactic acid bacteria, primarily Lactobacillus spp., were dominant in the microbiota of most girls well before the onset of menarche in the early to middle stages of puberty. Gardnerella vaginalis was detected at appreciable levels in approximately one-third of subjects, a notable finding considering that this organism is commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis in adults. Vulvar microbiota closely resembled vaginal microbiota but often exhibited additional taxa typically associated with skin microbiota. Our findings suggest that the vaginal microbiota of girls begin to resemble those of adults well before the onset of menarche. IMPORTANCE: This study addresses longitudinal changes in vaginal and vulvar microbial communities prior to and immediately following menarche. The research is significant because microbial ecology of the vagina is an integral aspect of health, including resistance to infections. The physiologic changes of puberty and initiation of cyclic menstruation are likely to have profound effects on vaginal microbiota, but almost nothing is known about changes that normally occur during this time. Our understanding has been especially hampered by the lack of thorough characterization of microbial communities using techniques that do not rely on the cultivation of fastidious bacteria, as well as a dearth of studies on girls in the early to middle stages of puberty. This study improves our understanding of the normal development of vaginal microbiota during puberty and onset of menarche and may better inform clinical approaches to vulvovaginal care of adolescent girls.
TI  - The association of uterine cervical microbiota with an increased risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in Korea.
AB  - Recent studies have suggested potential roles of the microbiome in cervicovaginal diseases. However, there has been no report on the cervical microbiome in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We aimed to identify the cervical microbiota of Korean women and assess the association between the cervical microbiota and CIN, and to determine the combined effect of the microbiota and human papillomavirus (HPV) on the risk of CIN. The cervical microbiota of 70 women with CIN and 50 control women was analysed using pyrosequencing based on the 16S rRNA gene. The associations between specific microbial patterns or abundance of specific microbiota and CIN risk were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, and the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and the synergy index (S) were calculated. The phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Fusobacteria and TM7 were predominant in the microbiota and four distinct community types were observed in all women. A high score of the pattern characterized by predominance of Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus iners with a minority of Lactobacillus crispatus had a higher CIN risk (OR 5.80, 95% CI 1.7319.4) and abundance of A. vaginae had a higher CIN risk (OR 6.63, 95% CI 1.6127.2). The synergistic effect of a high score of this microbial pattern and oncogenic HPV was observed (OR 34.1, 95% CI 4.95284.5; RERI/S, 15.9/1.93). A predominance of A. vaginae, G. vaginalis and L. iners with a concomitant paucity of L. crispatus in the cervical microbiota was associated with CIN risk, suggesting that bacterial dysbiosis and its combination with oncogenic HPV may be a risk factor for cervical neoplasia.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by a new multiplex peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization method.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of most common vaginal infections. However, its diagnosis by classical methods reveals low specificity. Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy diagnosis of 150 vaginal samples with research gold standard methods and our Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) probes by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) methodology. Also, we described the first PNA-FISH methodology for BV diagnosis, which provides results in approximately 3 h. The results showed a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), from 64.3 to 95.0%) and a specificity of 97.6% (95% CI [92.6-99.4%]), demonstrating the higher specificity of the PNA-FISH method and showing false positive results in BV diagnosis commonly obtained by the classical methods. This methodology combines the specificity of PNA probes for Lactobacillus species and G. vaginalis visualization and the calculation of the microscopic field by Nugent score, allowing a trustful evaluation of the bacteria present in vaginal microflora and avoiding the occurrence of misleading diagnostics. Therefore, the PNA-FISH methodology represents a valuable alternative for BV diagnosis.
TI  - Rapid and Profound Shifts in the Vaginal Microbiota Following Antibiotic Treatment for Bacterial Vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common polymicrobial disease associated with numerous negative reproductive health outcomes, including an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus acquisition. BV is treatable with antibiotics, but relapse is common. A more detailed understanding of bacterial dynamics during antibiotic therapy for BV could identify conditions that favor establishment, maintenance, and eradication of BV-associated bacterial species, thereby improving treatment outcomes. METHODS: We used mathematical models to analyze daily quantitative measurements of 11 key bacterial species during metronidazole treatment for 15 cases of BV. RESULTS: We identified complete reorganization of vaginal bacterial composition within a day of initiating therapy. Although baseline bacterial levels predicted a longer time to clearance, all anaerobic species were eliminated rapidly within a median of 3 days. However, reemergence of BV-associated species was common following treatment cessation. Gardnerella vaginalis, a facultative anaerobe, was cleared more slowly than anaerobic BV-associated species, and levels of G. vaginalis often rebounded during treatment. We observed gradual Lactobacillus species growth, indicating that untargeted microbes fill the transient vacuum formed during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Under antibiotic pressure, the human microbiome can undergo rapid shifts on a scale of hours. When treatment is stopped, BV-associated bacteria quickly reemerge, suggesting a possible role for intermittent prophylactic treatment.
TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - The Natural Antimicrobial Subtilosin A Synergizes with Lauramide Arginine Ethyl Ester (LAE), epsilon-Poly-L-lysine (Polylysine), Clindamycin Phosphate and Metronidazole, Against the Vaginal Pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. BV is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately Lactobacillus to a multispecies Actinomyces biofilm with the most common representatives identified as Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella spp. Current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. The objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against G. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. The four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-L-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin A. The use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these MICs in combination. Clindamycin and subtilosin (CS), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against G. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). All tested combinations were found to have Bliss synergy. The combination of clindamycin and polylysine (CP) was identified as antagonistic against L. acidophilus in terms of both FICI and Bliss synergy. The combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (CM) was antagonistic against L. vaginalis for both FICI and Bliss synergy. The combinations of CP, clindamycin and LAE, CS, and LAE and polylysine were identified as Bliss antagonistic against L. vaginalis but did not indicate FICI antagonism.
TI  - Colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (UGT) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. The excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. DNA was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for 12 bacterial species: Lactobacillus iners, L crispatus, L jensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera spp, Prevotella spp, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, BVAB1, BVAB2, BVAB3, and a broad-range16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. Endometrial fluid was tested with Luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. RESULTS: We enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and BV negative (n = 43; 74%). By species-specific quantitative PCR, 55 (95%) had UGT colonization with at least 1 species (n = 52) or were positive by 16S PCR (n = 3). The most common species were L iners (45% UGT, 61% vagina), Prevotella spp (33% UGT, 76% vagina) and L crispatus (33% UGT, 56% vagina). Median quantities of bacteria in the UGT were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. There were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, Lactobacillus only, or any BV-associated species in the UGT. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.
TI  - Comparative genomics of Lactobacillus crispatus suggests novel mechanisms for the competitive exclusion of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus crispatus is a ubiquitous micro-organism encountered in a wide range of host-associated habitats. It can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. Moreover, L. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. In order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of L. crispatus. RESULTS: Utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain ST1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other L. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of L. crispatus. Our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. Based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional L. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final L. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at about 1,116 ortholog groups. Importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. Using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved L. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the L. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of Gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. These findings thereby suggest that L. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from G. vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our pan-genome analysis provides insights into the intraspecific genome variability and the collective molecular mechanisms of the species L. crispatus. Using this approach, we described the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. Notably, the conserved genetic backbone of L. crispatus accounted for close to 60% of the ortholog groups of an average L. crispatus strain and included factors for the competitive exclusion of G. vaginalis, providing an explanation on how this urogenital species could improve vaginal health.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Differences in vaginal microbiome in African American women versus women of European ancestry.
AB  - Women of European ancestry are more likely to harbour a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome, whereas African American women are more likely to exhibit a diverse microbial profile. African American women are also twice as likely to be diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and are twice as likely to experience preterm birth. The objective of this study was to further characterize and contrast the vaginal microbial profiles in African American versus European ancestry women. Through the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project at Virginia Commonwealth University, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was used to compare the microbiomes of vaginal samples from 1268 African American women and 416 women of European ancestry. The results confirmed significant differences in the vaginal microbiomes of the two groups and identified several taxa relevant to these differences. Major community types were dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis and the uncultivated bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1 (BVAB1) that were common among African Americans. Moreover, the prevalence of multiple bacterial taxa that are associated with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and preterm birth, including Mycoplasma, Gardnerella, Prevotella and Sneathia, differed between the two ethnic groups. We investigated the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including pregnancy, body mass index, diet, smoking and alcohol use, number of sexual partners, and household income, to vaginal community composition. Ethnicity, pregnancy and alcohol use correlated significantly with the relative abundance of bacterial vaginosis-associated species. Trends between microbial profiles and smoking and number of sexual partners were observed; however, these associations were not statistically significant. These results support and extend previous findings that there are significant differences in the vaginal microbiome related to ethnicity and demonstrate that these differences are pronounced even in healthy women.
TI  - Characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy Canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. Understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. During a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth, colonization, and community structure. The objective of this study was to assess the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy Canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. Vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. Amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. Samples were also assayed for total 16S rRNA gene content and Gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative PCR and screened for the presence of Mollicutes by using family and genus-specific PCR. RESULTS: Overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. Microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. Clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus jensenii. Interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either Bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. Direct G. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and Mollicutes, including Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. Of interest in these findings was the presence of Bifidobacteriales beyond just Gardnerella species. Bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16S rRNA gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.
TI  - Utility of microscopic techniques and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of vaginal microflora alterations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of Nugent score, wet mount microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test developed in Russia for bacterial vaginosis (BV) diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred Caucasian women were enrolled in this study. Three vaginal samples were taken from each participant: 1 for PCR analysis, 1 for Nugent score evaluation, and 1 for wet mount microscopy. The smears for microscopy were air-dried and sent to Femicare, Tienen, Belgium, for blinded analysis by microscopy. Multiplex real-time PCR was performed using primers and probes targeting Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus species, and total quantity of bacterial DNA (16SrRNA gene). RESULTS: Agreement among the 3 methods was 72 (73.5%) of 98 samples. Agreement between Nugent score and PCR results was 77 (78.6%) of 98 samples; between wet mount microscopy and PCR, 81 (82.65%) of 98 samples; between wet mount microscopy and Nugent score, 84 (85.7%) of 98 samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the methods studied were as follows: 75% (21/28) and 97.1% (68/70) for Nugent score, 96.4% (27/28) and 94.3% (66/70) for wet mount microscopy, 92.8% (26/28) and 85.7% (60/70) for PCR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that wet mount microscopy is a superior method for BV diagnosis. The PCR test under study showed a high sensitivity and can be used for discrimination between normal flora and BV.
TI  - Comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the US.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to HIV infection and shedding. We assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the United States. METHODS: Genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from 46 US women (36 HIV-infected, 10 HIV-uninfected) and 40 Rwandan women (18 HIV-infected, 22 HIV-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) Nugent scores. Species of Lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. Prevalence of genera and Lactobacillus species were compared using Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Overall the seven most prevalent genera were Lactobacillus (74%), Prevotella (56%), Gardnerella (55%), Atopobium (42%), Sneathia (37%), Megasphaera (30%), and Parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing Rwandan to US women, except for Megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). Additionally, Rwandan women had higher frequencies of Mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and Eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of Lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and Allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with US women. The prevalence of Mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in HIV-infected Rwandan women (39%), compared to HIV-infected US women (6%), HIV-uninfected Rwandan (9%) and US (10%) women. The most prevalent lactobacillus species in both Rwandan and US women was L. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by L. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), L. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), L. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and L. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: We found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and Lactobacillus species in Rwandan and US women. Further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.
TI  - Characterization of the vaginal microflora in health and disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an imbalance of the vaginal bacterial microbiota and its aetiology is still unknown. Our aims were to investigate the diagnostic potential of species/genus specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) for bacteria present in swabs and first-void urine (FVU) samples using Nugent's and Claeys' criteria and 454 sequencing of the vaginal microbiome as reference. METHODS: Self-collected swabs, vaginal smears and FVU were obtained from 177 women from Greenland (Study I and III) and physician-collected vaginal swabs and smears were obtained from 163 Swedish women (Study II). BV was diagnosed by Nugent's criteria in Study I and III and by Amsel's criteria in Study II. The vaginal swabs and FVU samples were analysed by qPCR for selected vaginal bacteria in all three studies and for four sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Study I. RESULTS: Study I: STIs were common in women from Greenland and BV was found in 45% of these women but was not associated with individual STIs. In multivariate logistic analysis, Atopobium vaginae and Prevotella spp. were both independently associated with BV in swabs. BV could be subdivided into clusters dominated by a single or a few species together. Seven vaginal bacteria (A. vaginae, Prevotella spp. Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (BVAB) 2, Eggerthella-like bacterium, Leptotrichia amnionii and Megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve > 85% in swabs, suggesting that they were good predictors of BV according to Nugent. Study II: For the majority of species/genera, the kappa values indicated fair to good agreement when their presence was determined by 454 pyrosequencing versus real-time PCR. The same seven vaginal bacteria as found in Study I, had areas under the ROC-curve > 85% in swabs from Swedish women, demonstrating a good diagnostic accuracy for BV according to Amsel. Study III: In a multivariate model, Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. remained significantly associated with BV in FVU samples. A linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial load from swabs and FVU, but Prevotella spp. could be detected in high numbers in a few FVU samples without being present in swabs. After applying ROC curve analysis, the same seven vaginal bacteria as previously mentioned showed good prediction for BV according to Nugent in FVU. BV could be detected with comparable sensitivity in FVU and vaginal swabs. CONCLUSION: BV can be diagnosed by molecular methods performed either on swabs or urine but it is important to apply thresholds in order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Furthers it was possible to identify clusters of BV dominated by single or paired bacteria, and these clusters could classify BV into subgroups, providing a more detailed understanding of the condition. Seven vaginal bacteria were highly accurate for BV diagnosis both in swabs and FVU. Finally a good agreement between Nugent and Claeys was found.
TI  - Bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. The economic impact is high. An accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. We report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (STIP) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections using a multiplex PCR followed by Luminex bead-based hybridisation. METHODS: STIP was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative PCR, microscopy or by culturing methods. RESULTS: STIP specifically detects Chlamydia trachomatis, Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma (M.) genitalium, M. hominis, M. pneumonia, M. spermatophilum, Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis as well as three Candida species and normal genital flora-associated Lactobacillus species. STIP reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative PCR tests. Compared to Nugent score, STIP reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. Candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: STIP is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of seaweed extracts on the growth of the vaginal bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Of 44 species of seaweed screened for potential anti-Gardnerella vaginalis activity, 27 (61.4%) showed antimicrobial activity by the agar disk-diffusion method. Among them, the strongest activities against the pathogen were exhibited by Chlorophyta, with Ulva pertusa producing an 11.3-mm zone of inhibition at 5 mg disk(-)(1). The MIC values of U. pertusa extracts against both G. vaginalis KCTC 5096 and KCTC 5097, the main cause of vaginosis, were 312 mug ml(-)(1), while the MIC values against both Candida albicans KCTC 7270 and KCTC 7965, the main cause of candidiasis, were 2.5 mg ml(-)(1). Against Lactobacillus gasseri KCTC 3173 and Lactobacillus jensenii KCTC 5194, members of the normal vaginal microflora, no inhibitory effect was seen even at 10 mg ml(-)(1). To identify the primary active compounds, a U. pertusa powder was successively fractionated according to polarity, and the main active agents against G. vaginalis KCTC 5096 were determined to be nitrogenous compounds (156 mug ml(-)(1) of the MIC value). According to these results, it was suggested that extracts of the seaweed U. pertusa are valuable for the development of natural therapeutic agents for treating women with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against Escherichia coli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Female genital tract secretions inhibit E. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. We hypothesized that high E. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a Lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-E. coli activity. The V6 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Filtered culture supernatants from Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for E. coli inhibitory activity. RESULTS: Sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. There was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8 each). However, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low E. coli inhibitory activity. High activity was associated with a predominance of L. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from L. crispatus exhibited greater E. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from L. iners or G. vaginalis. Notably, the E. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of L. crispatus. CONCLUSION: Microbiome communities with abundant L. crispatus likely contribute to the E. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent E. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.
TI  - Rifaximin modulates the vaginal microbiome and metabolome in women affected by bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal disorder characterized by the decrease of lactobacilli and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and resident anaerobic vaginal bacteria. In the present work, the effects of rifaximin vaginal tablets on vaginal microbiota and metabolome of women affected by BV were investigated by combining quantitative PCR and a metabolomic approach based on (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance. To highlight the general trends of the bacterial communities and metabolomic profiles in response to the antibiotic/placebo therapy, a multivariate statistical strategy was set up based on the trajectories traced by vaginal samples in a principal component analysis space. Our data demonstrated the efficacy of rifaximin in restoring a health-like condition in terms of both bacterial communities and metabolomic features. In particular, rifaximin treatment was significantly associated with an increase in the lactobacillus/BV-related bacteria ratio, as well as with an increase in lactic acid concentration and a decrease of a pool of metabolites typically produced by BV-related bacteria (acetic acid, succinate, short-chain fatty acids, and biogenic amines). Among the tested dosages of rifaximin (100 and 25 mg for 5 days and 100 mg for 2 days), 25 mg for 5 days was found to be the most effective.
TI  - Curative effect of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus fermentum L23 in a murine model of vaginal infection by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection characterized by changes in the vaginal microbiota. The objective of this work was to evaluate the colonization ability and curative effect of Lactobacillus fermentum L23 after vaginal administration in female BALB/c mice infected with Gardnerella vaginalis. One dose of Lact. fermentum L23 containing 10(9 ) CFU ml(-1) was administered locally in a murine vaginal model. L23 colonized the vaginal tract of BALB-c mice after one inoculation. The infection by G. vaginalis in a murine model was induced by vaginal administration of a 1 x 10(6 ) CFU ml(-1) suspension. Infection with the pathogen was observed in the vaginal tract for 4 days. At 144 h after inoculation, levels of 4 log10 CFU ml(-1) were observed. The curative effect of L23 was evaluated with one administration at 1 x 10(9 ) CFU ml(-1) 72 h after the inoculation with G. vaginalis. Lactobacillus fermentum L23 inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis. The results of suppression of G. vaginalis using different concentrations of L23 were favourable due that these concentrations are normally used in commercial formulas. The obtained results indicate that Lact. fermentum L23 inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis. Therefore, L23 might be used as a potential biotherapeutic agent for the elimination of this bacterium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus fermentum L23 as a biotherapeutic agent can be expected to prevent and treat genital infections, particularly recurrent bacterial vaginosis, with similar concentrations to those normally used in commercial formulas. It is likely that the use of this probiotic strain for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis will provide a natural and nontoxic treatment modality.
TI  - Polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels for controlled release of the antimicrobial subtilosin for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Current treatment options for bacterial vaginosis (BV) have been shown to be inadequate at preventing recurrence and do not provide protection against associated infections, such as that with HIV. This study examines the feasibility of incorporating the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin within covalently cross-linked polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels for vaginal administration. The PEG-based hydrogels (4% and 6% [wt/vol]) provided a two-phase release of subtilosin, with an initial rapid release rate of 4.0 mug/h (0 to 12 h) followed by a slow, sustained release rate of 0.26 mug/h (12 to 120 h). The subtilosin-containing hydrogels inhibited the growth of the major BV-associated pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis with a reduction of 8 log10 CFU/ml with hydrogels containing >/=15 mug entrapped subtilosin. In addition, the growth of four common species of vaginal lactobacilli was not significantly inhibited in the presence of the subtilosin-containing hydrogels. The above findings demonstrate the potential application of vaginal subtilosin-containing hydrogels for prophylaxis of BV.
TI  - Identification of vaginal lactobacilli with potential probiotic properties isolated from women in North Lebanon.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the diversity of vaginal lactobacilli in Lebanese women and to evaluate the antagonism, hydrophobicity, and safety characteristics of these strains. This study was performed on samples from 135 women who visited a gynecology clinic in the north of Lebanon, between September 2012 and January 2013. From these samples, 53 different isolates of vaginal lactobacilli were collected from vaginal swabs and identified using biochemical and molecular methods. The use of genotypic Rep-PCR fingerprinting allowed for the organization of these isolates into 23 different groups. Seven of the isolated lactobacilli were antagonistic against the following vaginal pathogens: Gardnerella vaginalis CIP7074T, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33862, Escherichia coli CIP103982, and Candida albicans ATCC10231. The antagonistic lactobacilli strains were then identified using 16S rDNA sequence. The data of this study show that the antagonistic lactobacilli were non-hemolytic, sensitive to most antibiotic tests, free of plasmid DNA, and exhibited interesting hydrophobicity and autoaggregation properties positioning them as potential candidates for probiotic design.
TI  - The composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. We compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. RESULTS: A retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n = 22). Serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. A 16S rRNA gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. Linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. The vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of Lactobacillus vaginalis, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). Bacterial community state type (CST) IV-B or CST IV-A characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus Atopobium as well as the presence of Prevotella, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Ruminococcaceae, Parvimonas, Mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. The stability of the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women; however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively from one CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. to another CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSION: We report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. Differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. Lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. These results can serve as the basis to study the relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - Benzoyl peroxide formulated polycarbophil/carbopol 934P hydrogel with selective antimicrobial activity, potentially beneficial for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The human vagina is colonized by a variety of indigenous microflora; in healthy individuals the predominant bacterial genus is Lactobacillus while those with bacterial vaginosis (BV) carry a variety of anaerobic representatives of the phylum Actinobacteria. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) encapsulated in a hydrogel against Gardnerella vaginalis, one of the causative agents of BV, as well as indicating its safety for healthy human lactobacilli. Herein, it is shown that in well diffusion assays G. vaginalis is inhibited at 0.01% hydrogel-encapsulated BPO and that the tested Lactobacillus spp. can tolerate concentrations of BPO up to 2.5%. In direct contact assays (cells grown in a liquid culture containing hydrogel with 1% BPO or BPO particles), we demonstrated that hydrogels loaded with 1% BPO caused 6-log reduction of G. vaginalis. Conversely, three of the tested Lactobacillus spp. were not inhibited while L. acidophilus growth was slightly delayed. The rheological properties of the hydrogel formulation were probed using oscillation frequency sweep, oscillation shear stress sweep, and shear rate sweep. This shows the gel to be suitable for vaginal application and that the encapsulation of BPO did not alter rheological properties.
TI  - More than meets the eye: associations of vaginal bacteria with gram stain morphotypes using molecular phylogenetic analysis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent condition associated with adverse  health outcomes. Gram stain analysis of vaginal fluid is the standard for confirming the diagnosis of BV, wherein abundances of key bacterial morphotypes are assessed. These Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, and Mobiluncus morphotypes were originally linked to particular bacterial species through cultivation studies, but no studies have systematically investigated associations between uncultivated bacteria detected by molecular methods and Gram stain findings. In this study, 16S-rRNA PCR/pyrosequencing was used to examine associations between vaginal bacteria and bacterial morphotypes in 220 women with and without BV. Species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluorescence in Situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used to document concentrations of two bacteria with curved rod morphologies: Mobiluncus and the fastidious BV-associated bacterium-1 (BVAB1). Rank abundance of vaginal bacteria in samples with evidence of curved gram-negative rods showed that BVAB1 was dominant (26.1%), while Mobiluncus was rare (0.2% of sequence reads). BVAB1 sequence reads were associated with Mobiluncus morphotypes (p<0.001). Among women with curved rods, mean concentration of BVAB1 DNA was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus (p<0.001) using species-specific quantitative PCR. FISH analyses revealed that mean number of BVAB1 cells was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus cells in women with highest Nugent score (p<0.001). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were significantly associated with the "Bacteroides morphotype," whereas Bacteroides species were rare. Gram-negative rods designated Mobiluncus morphotypes on Gram stain are more likely BVAB1. These findings provide a clearer picture of the bacteria associated with morphotypes on vaginal Gram stain.
TI  - Prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis among women with lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in women with normal vaginal flora. METHODS: Women without symptoms or signs of vaginal infection and five or fewer lifetime sexual partners were recruited for a longitudinal study of vaginal flora. Negative Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 0-3 were required for enrolment. Vaginal specimens were self-collected daily for Gram stain and every 3 days for PCR for G vaginalis for 30 days. Women completed daily diaries recording sexual activity, symptoms and menses. RESULTS: Twenty women were recruited for the study with 19 completing all specimens and 1 lost to follow-up. During the 30-day study period, 13/19 (68.4%) of women had normal Nugent scores (0-3) whereas 6/19 (31.6%) of women had at least 2 days of Nugent scores in the intermediate range (p=0.09). Among the 19 women, 9 (47%) were negative for G vaginalis by PCR throughout the study period whereas 10 (53%) had at least one specimen that demonstrated the presence of G vaginalis by PCR. Of those women with intermediate flora on Gram stain during the course of the study 5/6 (83.3%) were positive for G vaginalis while 5/13 (38.5%) of those women with only normal Nugent scores were positive for G vaginalis. Thus, 61.5% of women with normal Nugent scores had no evidence of G vaginalis by serial PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Gardnerella may not be part of the normal flora in women with optimal vaginal health.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract of heifers and cows.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the adherence of indigenous vaginal bacteria, probiotic strains, and metritis pathogens to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tracts of heifers and cows and compared their adherence with the bacterial adherence to mucus collected from the stomach and large intestine of pigs. Most of the vaginal strains adhered to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract and strongly adhered to gastric mucus, with the exception of Lactobacillus buchneri 24S8. Only Lactobacillus mucosae 29S8, Enterococcus faecium E21, and E. faecium EAC adhered to colonic mucus. Probiotic strains adhered strongly to mucus collected from the reproductive tract and gastric mucus but did not adhere to colonic mucus. Pathogenic strains were adherent to vaginal, uterine horn, and gastric mucus, except Escherichia coli O8:K88ab:H9 (65), Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Gardnerella vaginalis, which adhered to uterine cervix mucus. Only Kocuria kristinae and G. vaginalis adhered to uterine body mucus; E. coli O149:K88ac (EC) adhered to colonic mucus. The strains did not exhibit host specificity but rather strain specificity. The ability to adhere to mucus was a characteristic unique to each strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding in vitro adherence of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) lactobacilli isolated from different sources to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract.
TI  - Biomedical applications of fermenticin HV6b isolated from Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC10770.
AB  - Fermenticin HV6b is a class IIa antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC 10770 isolated from human vaginal ecosystem. It shows growth inhibition of a wide range of opportunistic pathogens of humans, for example, Bacteroides, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Staphylococci, and Streptococci, associated with bacterial vaginosis in humans. It does possess an impressive sperm immobilization and spermicidal activity tested against human sperms which makes it an attractive proposition for formulating antibacterial vaginosis and contraceptive products. Apart from this, in vitro studies conducted against four different tissue models have indicated its potential to be used as a component of anticancerous drug therapy as it is reported to induce apoptosis in cancerous cells. This information could be integrated in future studies focusing on in vivo assessment of anticancerous activity of lactic acid bacterial toxins or bacteriocins.
TI  - Reciprocal interference between Lactobacillus spp. and Gardnerella vaginalis on initial adherence to epithelial cells.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder in women of child-bearing age. It is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to the flora commonly associated with BV is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by specific Lactobacillus species together with an increase of G. vaginalis and other anaerobes. However, the order of events leading to the development of BV remains poorly characterized and it is unclear whether the decrease in lactobacilli is a cause or a consequence of the increase in the population density of anaerobes. Our goal was to characterize the interaction between two Gardnerella vaginalis strains, one of which was isolated from a healthy woman (strain 5-1) and the other from a woman diagnosed with BV (strain 101), and vaginal lactobacilli on the adherence to cervical epithelial cells. In order to simulate the transition from vaginal health to BV, the lactobacilli were cultured with the epithelial cells first, and then the G. vaginalis strain was introduced. We quantified the inhibition of G. vaginalis adherence by the lactobacilli and displacement of adherent lactobacilli by G. vaginalis. Our results confirmed that pathogenic G vaginalis 101 had a higher capacity for adhesion to the cervical epithelial cells than strain 5-1. Interestingly, strain 101 displaced L. crispatus but not L. iners whereas strain 5-1 had less of an effect and did not affect the two species differently. Furthermore, L. iners actually enhanced adhesion of strain 101 but not of strain 5-1. These results suggest that BV-causing G. vaginalis and L. iners do not interfere with one another, which may help to explain previous reports that women who are colonized with L. iners are more likely to develop BV.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of initial adhesion of bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes to ME-180 cells.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the leading vaginal disorder but the transition from health to this dysbiotic condition remains poorly characterized. Our goal was to quantify the ability of BV-associated anaerobes to adhere to epithelial cells in the presence of lactobacilli. Gardnerella vaginalis outcompeted Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners actually enhanced its adherence.
TI  - The villain team-up or how Trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis alter innate immunity in concert.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Complex interactions of vaginal microorganisms with the genital tract epithelium shape mucosal innate immunity, which holds the key to sexual and reproductive health. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a microbiome-disturbance syndrome prevalent in reproductive-age women, occurs commonly in concert with trichomoniasis, and both are associated with increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes and viral infections, largely attributable to inflammation. To investigate the causative relationships among inflammation, BV and trichomoniasis, we established a model of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells colonised by vaginal Lactobacillus isolates, dominant in healthy women, and common BV species (Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia). METHODS: Colonised epithelia were infected with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) or exposed to purified TV virulence factors (membrane lipophosphoglycan (LPG), its ceramide-phosphoinositol-glycan core (CPI-GC) or the endosymbiont Trichomonas vaginalis virus (TVV)), followed by assessment of bacterial colony-forming units, the mucosal anti-inflammatory microbicide secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and chemokines that drive pro-inflammatory, antigen-presenting and T cells. RESULTS: TV reduced colonisation by Lactobacillus but not by BV species, which were found inside epithelial cells. TV increased interleukin (IL)-8 and suppressed SLPI, likely via LPG/CPI-GC, and upregulated IL-8 and RANTES, likely via TVV as suggested by use of purified pathogenic determinants. BV species A vaginae and G vaginalis induced IL-8 and RANTES, and also amplified the pro-inflammatory responses to both LPG/CPI-GC and TVV, whereas P bivia suppressed the TV/TVV-induced chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: These molecular host-parasite-endosymbiont-bacteria interactions explain epidemiological associations and suggest a revised paradigm for restoring vaginal immunity and preventing BV/TV-attributable inflammatory sequelae in women.
TI  - ANOVA-like differential expression (ALDEx) analysis for mixed population RNA-Seq.
AB  - Experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. This variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability between biological conditions. The high per-sample cost of RNA-Seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard ANOVA models. We show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored, whether in single-organism RNA-Seq or in Meta-RNA-Seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used RNA-Seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. These two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. As it is usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed ALDEx, an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. We show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even very small sample sizes.
TI  - Comparison of the vaginal microbiota diversity of women with and without human papillomavirus infection: a cross-sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The female genital tract is an important bacterial habitat of the human body, and vaginal microbiota plays a crucial role in vaginal health. The alteration of vaginal microbiota affects millions of women annually, and is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, previous studies have primarily focused on the association between bacterial vaginosis and HPV infection. Little is known about the composition of vaginal microbial communities involved in HPV acquisition. The present study was performed to investigate whether HPV infection was associated with the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota. METHODS: A total of 70 healthy women (32 HPV-negative and 38 HPV-positive) with normal cervical cytology were enrolled in this study. Culture-independent polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to measure the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota of all subjects. RESULTS: We found significantly greater biological diversity in the vaginal microbiota of HPV-positive women (p < 0.001). Lactobacillus, including L. gallinarum, L. iners and L. gasseri, was the predominant genus and was detected in all women. No significant difference between HPV-positive and HPV-negative women was found for the frequency of detection of L. gallinarum (p = 0.775) or L. iners (p = 0.717), but L. gasseri was found at a significantly higher frequency in HPV-positive women (p = 0.005). Gardnerella vaginalis was also found at a significantly higher frequency in HPV-positive women (p = 0.031). Dendrograms revealed that vaginal microbiota from the two groups had different profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first systematic evaluation of an association between vaginal microbiota and HPV infection, and we have demonstrated that compared with HPV-negative women, the bacterial diversity of HPV-positive women is more complex and the composition of vaginal microbiota is different.
TI  - Interactions between Lactobacillus crispatus and Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)-Associated Bacterial Species in Initial Attachment and Biofilm Formation.
AB  - Certain anaerobic bacterial species tend to predominate the vaginal flora during  bacterial vaginosis (BV), with Gardnerella vaginalis being the most common. However, the exact role of G. vaginalis in BV has not yet been determined. The main goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that G. vaginalis is an early colonizer, paving the way for intermediate (e.g., Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (e.g., Prevotella bivia). Theoretically, in order to function as an early colonizer, species would need to be able to adhere to vaginal epithelium, even in the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. Therefore, we quantified adherence of G. vaginalis and other BV-associated bacteria to an inert surface pre-coated with Lactobacillus crispatus using a new Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) methodology. We found that G. vaginalis had the greatest capacity to adhere in the presence of L. crispatus. Theoretically, an early colonizer would contribute to the adherence and/or growth of additional species, so we next quantified the effect of G. vaginalis biofilms on the adherence and growth of other BV-associated species by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) technique. Interestingly, G. vaginalis derived a growth benefit from the addition of a second species, regardless of the species. Conversely, G. vaginalis biofilms enhanced the growth of P. bivia, and to a minor extent of F. nucleatum. These results contribute to our understanding of BV biofilm formation and the progression of the disorder.
TI  - In vitro probiotic properties of Lactobacillus fermentum SK5 isolated from vagina of a healthy woman.
AB  - A lactobacillus strain isolated from a vaginal tract of a healthy woman was examined in vitro for its probiotic potential. This strain, identified as Lactobacillus fermentum SK5, was able to survive at pH 3-4 and 0.1-0.2% bile, and unaffected by pepsin (3 g l(-1)) and pancreatin (1 g l(-1)), but was susceptible to all tested antibiotics except metronidazole. L. fermentum SK5 had an antimicrobial potential against gastrointestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and vaginal pathogenic Gardnerella vaginalis. The effective substance was suspected to be a bacteriocin-like compound with a molecular weight of more than 10 kDa, but hydrogen peroxide was also detected. Further studies revealed that L. fermentum SK5 had good autoaggregation characteristic and a high surface hydrophobicity that enhanced its adhesion ability to epithelial cells and for biofilm formation. This lactobacillus showed coaggregation with E. coli and G. vaginalis to affect their adhesion and colonization. The adhesion of L. fermentum SK5 to HeLa, HT-29 and Caco-2 cells and its inhibition of E. coli and G. vaginalis adherence to these cells were demonstrated. These incidences provided evidence of the possible colonization of L. fermentum SK5 that would prevent binding and growth of E. coli and G. vaginalis onto intestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. On the basis of the ability of L. fermentum SK5 to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms through coaggregation and antimicrobial substances, it is likely that this lactobacillus strain could be a potential probiotic candidate for beneficial use in protecting against gastrointestinal and vaginal microbial infections.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ Hybridization method using Peptide Nucleic Acid probes for rapid detection of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella spp.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection occurring in women of reproductive age. It is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to BV is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by Lactobacillus species together with an increase of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes. Our goal was to develop and optimize a novel Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Fluorescence in situ Hybridization assay (PNA FISH) for the detection of Lactobacillus spp. and G. vaginalis in mixed samples. RESULTS: Therefore, we evaluated and validated two specific PNA probes by using 36 representative Lactobacillus strains, 22 representative G. vaginalis strains and 27 other taxonomically related or pathogenic bacterial strains commonly found in vaginal samples. The probes were also tested at different concentrations of G. vaginalis and Lactobacillus species in vitro, in the presence of a HeLa cell line. Specificity and sensitivity of the PNA probes were found to be 98.0% (95% confidence interval (CI), from 87.8 to 99.9%) and 100% (95% CI, from 88.0 to 100.0%), for Lactobacillus spp.; and 100% (95% CI, from 92.8 to 100%) and 100% (95% CI, from 81.5 to 100.0%) for G. vaginalis. Moreover, the probes were evaluated in mixed samples mimicking women with BV or normal vaginal microflora, demonstrating efficiency and applicability of our PNA FISH. CONCLUSIONS: This quick method accurately detects Lactobacillus spp. and G. vaginalis species in mixed samples, thus enabling efficient evaluation of the two bacterial groups, most frequently encountered in the vagina.
TI  - Composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age--sensitive and specific molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is possible?
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder, characterized by depletion of the normal lactobacillus-dominant microbiota and overgrowth of commensal anaerobic bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age (healthy women and women with BV), with the view of developing molecular criteria for BV diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vaginal samples from 163 women (79 control, 73 BV and 11 intermediate (Lactobacillary grade II flora) cases) were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing of the hypervariable regions V3-V4 of the 16S rRNA gene and 16 quantitative bacterial species/genus-specific real-time PCR assays. Sensitivities and specificities of potential BV markers were computed using the Amsel criteria as reference standard for BV. The use of quantitative thresholds for prediction of BV, determined for both relative abundance measured with 454 pyrosequencing and bacterial load measured with qPCR, was evaluated. RESULTS: Relative to the healthy women, the BV patients had in their vaginal microbiota significantly higher prevalence, loads and relative abundances of the majority of BV associated bacteria. However, only Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Eggerthella, Prevotella, BVAB2 and Megasphaera type 1 detected at or above optimal thresholds were highly predictable for BV, with the best diagnostic accuracy shown for A. vaginae. The depletion of Lactobacillus species combined with the presence of either G. vaginalis or A. vaginae at diagnostic levels was a highly accurate BV predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative determination of the presence of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, Eggerthella, Prevotella, BVAB2 and Megasphaera type 1 as well as the depletion of Lactobacillus was highly accurate for BV diagnosis. Measurements of abundance of normal and BV microbiota relative to total bacteria in vaginal fluid may provide more accurate BV diagnosis, and be used for test-of-cure, rather than qualitative detection or absolute counts of BV related microorganisms.
TI  - Clinical features of bacterial vaginosis in a murine model of vaginal infection with Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a dysbiosis of the vaginal flora characterized by a shift from a Lactobacillus-dominant environment to a polymicrobial mixture including Actinobacteria and gram-negative bacilli. BV is a common vaginal condition in women and is associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. Gardnerella vaginalis is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial species in BV. However, there has been much debate in the literature concerning the contribution of G. vaginalis to the etiology of BV, since it is also present in a significant proportion of healthy women. Here we present a new murine vaginal infection model with a clinical isolate of G. vaginalis. Our data demonstrate that this model displays key features used clinically to diagnose BV, including the presence of sialidase activity and exfoliated epithelial cells with adherent bacteria (reminiscent of clue cells). G. vaginalis was capable of ascending uterine infection, which correlated with the degree of vaginal infection and level of vaginal sialidase activity. The host response to G. vaginalis infection was characterized by robust vaginal epithelial cell exfoliation in the absence of histological inflammation. Our analyses of clinical specimens from women with BV revealed a measureable epithelial exfoliation response compared to women with normal flora, a phenotype that, to our knowledge, is measured here for the first time. The results of this study demonstrate that G. vaginalis is sufficient to cause BV phenotypes and suggest that this organism may contribute to BV etiology and associated complications. This is the first time vaginal infection by a BV associated bacterium in an animal has been shown to parallel the human disease with regard to clinical diagnostic features. Future studies with this model should facilitate investigation of important questions regarding BV etiology, pathogenesis and associated complications.
TI  - Characterization of the vaginal micro- and mycobiome in asymptomatic reproductive-age Estonian women.
AB  - The application of high-throughput sequencing methods has raised doubt in the concept of the uniform healthy vaginal microbiota consisting predominantly of lactobacilli by revealing the existence of more variable bacterial community composition. As this needs to be analyzed more extensively and there is little straightforward data regarding the vaginal mycobiome of asymptomatic women we aimed to define bacterial and fungal communities in vaginal samples from 494 asymptomatic, reproductive-age Estonian women. The composition of the vaginal microbiota was determined by amplifying bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) regions and subsequently sequencing them using 454 Life Sciences pyrosequencing. We delineated five major bacterial community groups with distinctive diversity and species composition. Lactobacilli were among the most abundant bacteria in all groups, but also members of genus Gardnerella had high relative abundance in some of the groups. Microbial diversity increased with higher vaginal pH values, and was also higher when a malodorous discharge was present, indicating that some of the women who consider themselves healthy may potentially have asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV). Our study is the first of its kind to analyze the mycobiome that colonizes the healthy vaginal environment using barcoded pyrosequencing technology. We observed 196 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), including 16 OTUs of Candida spp., which is more diverse than previously recognized. However, assessing true fungal diversity was complicated because of the problems regarding the possible air-borne contamination and bioinformatics used for identification of fungal taxons as significant proportion of fungal sequences were assigned to unspecified OTUs.
TI  - Pregnancy-induced changes in immune protection of the genital tract: defining normal.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Both the state of pregnancy as well as disruption of vaginal flora and immune mediators may increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus-1 acquisition. The objective of this study was to define immune changes in lower genital and systemic immunity associated with normal pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort enrolled low-risk pregnant and nonpregnant women ages 18-35 years. Pregnant women at <14 weeks and nonpregnant women in follicular phase of the menstrual cycle were included. Cervical and vaginal fluid was collected. Concentrations of immune mediators were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods or multiplex immunoassay. Samples were inoculated onto various culture media allowing for growth of Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, anaerobic gram-negative rods, Candida, Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma species, and Mycoplasma hominis. Concentrations of immune mediators and vaginal colonization frequencies were compared between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups. RESULTS: Genital tract concentration of interleukin-1beta was higher during pregnancy compared to nonpregnant participants. Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were higher in all trimesters of pregnancy. Concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor did not differ between groups. Lactobacillus was more commonly isolated from vaginal cultures of nonpregnant participants (100% vs 70.2%, P = .02). Identification of Candida, G vaginalis, M hominis, and S aureus was common and not different between groups. Ureaplasma species was isolated from >60% pregnant participants. CONCLUSION: The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta, as well as the systemic marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein, are increased during pregnancy. The impact of these proinflammatory changes during pregnancy deserves further study.
TI  - The microbiota of the human genitourinary tract: trying to see the forest through the trees.
AB  - Based on traditional microbiological methods, namely cultivation and microscopic  analyses, the vaginal microbiota (VMB) has been defined as healthy when it is predominated by hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp., most prominently Lactobacillis crispatus. Similarly, the VMB has been defined as bacterial vaginosis (BV) when it is predominated by Gardnerella vaginalis as well as a number of other anaerobic bacterial species. BV is associated with a distinct vaginal discharge syndrome, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, post-operative wound infections, and endometritis after elective abortions. Additionally, BV predisposes women to infection by HIV as well as other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The application of molecular techniques over the last decade to studies of the VMB has significantly advanced our understanding of its structure and variation. It is now clear that the diversity of the VMB is far more complex than previously recognized; it is comprised of many heretofore unknown bacteria in addition to those previously identified by culture. Here we describe the application of 454 pyrosequencing technology to a study of vaginal specimens from 92 women attending the New Orleans STD clinic in an effort to obtain a more precise view of how different types of "trees" (bacteria) assemble to form a recognizable "forest" (VMB). This knowledge will be useful in the design of future clinical studies that investigate the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome influences human health and disease.
TI  - [GynOphilus--a winning relay].
AB  - The vagina is a complex biocenosis where many micro-organisms coexist and colonize it. The dominant colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual is of the genus "lactobacillus". It is also called Doderlein's bacillus and determines the vaginal microbial balance through the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, bacteriocines and modify the competition of pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal epithelial cells. Through these mechanisms the lactobacilli block the growth and development of other vaginal pathogenic microbial species and also inhibit the colonization of some other microorganisms imported from outside. Because of these potential therapeutic properties, the lactobacilli are used as effective medical agents for prophylaxys and therapy to restore the physiological balance in the vaginal eco-system. According to our studies and gained clinical experience the etiological antibacterial treatment is not always sufficient to restore the normal vaginal flora. The complete recovery of the vaginal flora could be reached using probiotics that are applied locally and per os. GynOphilus is a new vaginal probiotic product containing one type of the genus "Lactobacillus": Lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus. GynOphilus restores the physiological balance of the vaginal flora and reduces the risk of recurrent infection. The product is applied intravaginal and interacts locally, inhibits the growth of the most common vaginal pathogens: Gardnerella vaginalis u Candida albicans.
TI  - Effect of sexual debut on vaginal microbiota in a cohort of young women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis is uncommon in women who are virgins. We estimated effects of sexual debut on vaginal bacterial colonization. METHODS: Women who were virgins and aged 18-22 years enrolled in a study of human papillomavirus acquisition were followed every 4 months for up to 2 years. Vaginal swabs from before and after sexual debut or two independent visits for those remaining virgins were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis, and the bacterial vaginosis-associated species Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera species, Leptotrichia species, Sneathia species, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1, -2, and -3. RESULTS: We evaluated 97 women: 71 who became sexually active and 26 who remained virgins. At first sampling, 22 of 26 (85%) women who remained virgins were colonized with Lactobacillus species compared with 22 of 26 (85%) at follow-up (P>.99). G vaginalis was present in 12 of 26 (46%) initially and 11 of 26 (42%) at follow-up (P>.99). Among women who became sexually active, colonization with Lactobacillus species remained stable: 65 of 71 (92%) compared with 66 of 71 (93%) (P>.99), whereas colonization with G vaginalis increased (28 of 71 [39%] compared with 40 of 71 [56%]; P=.02). Among women who did not initiate sexual activity during the study, two of 26 (8%) had any bacterial vaginosis-associated species detected at both the first and second visits (P>.99). Among women who became sexually active during the study, 15 of 71 (21%) were colonized with bacterial vaginosis-associated species initially compared with 13 of 71 (18%) after sexual debut (P=.77). CONCLUSIONS: Among women who were virgins, vaginal colonization with bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterial species is uncommon and does not change after sexual debut.
TI  - The anti-HIV microbicide candidate RC-101 inhibits pathogenic vaginal bacteria without harming endogenous flora or mucosa.
AB  - PROBLEM: Vaginal microbicides represent a promising approach for preventing heterosexual HIV transmission. However, preclinical evaluation should be conducted to ensure that microbicides will be safe for human cells and healthy microflora of the female reproductive tract. One microbicide candidate, RC-101, has been effective and well tolerated in preliminary cell culture and macaque models. However, the effect of RC-101 on primary vaginal tissues and resident vaginal microflora requires further evaluation. METHOD OF STUDY: We treated primary vaginal tissues and vaginal bacteria, both pathogenic and commensal, with RC-101 to investigate effects of this microbicide. RESULTS: RC-101 was well tolerated by host tissues, and also by commensal vaginal bacteria. Simultaneously, pathogenic vaginal bacteria, which are known to increase susceptibility to HIV acquisition, were inhibited by RC-101. CONCLUSIONS: By establishing vaginal microflora, the specific antibacterial activity of RC-101 may provide a dual mechanism of HIV protection. These findings support advancement of RC-101 to clinical trials.
TI  - In silico vs in vitro analysis of primer specificity for the detection of Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae and Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common pathology of women in reproductive age that can lead to serious health complications, and is associated with shifts in the normal microflora from predominance of Lactobacillus spp. to a proliferation of other anaerobes such as G. vaginalis and A vaginae, which can be detected by PCR. The optimal PCR pathogen detection assay relies mainly on the specificity and sensitivity of the primers used. FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that in silico analytical testing of primer specificity is not a synonym to in vitro analytical specificity by testing a range of published and newly designed primers with both techniques for the detection of BV-associated microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: By testing primer in vitro specificity with a sufficient range of bacterial strains, we were able to design primers with higher specificity and sensitivity. Also by comparing the results obtained for the newly designed primers with other previously published primers, we confirmed that in silico analysis is not sufficient to predict in vitro specificity. As such care must be taken when choosing the primers for a detection assay.
TI  - Phase I randomized safety study of twice daily dosing of acidform vaginal gel: candidate antimicrobial contraceptive.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acidform gel, an acid-buffering product that inactivates spermatozoa, may be an effective topical non-hormonal contraceptive. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of vaginal dosing and effects of Acidform on mucosal immune mediators, antimicrobial properties of genital secretions, and vaginal microbiota. METHODS: Thirty-six sexually abstinent U.S. women were randomized to apply Acidform or hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) placebo gel twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Safety was assessed by symptoms and pelvic examination. The impact of gel on mucosal immunity was assessed by quantifying cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial proteins and antimicrobial activity of genital secretions collected by cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) at screening, 2 hours after gel application, and on days 7, 14 and 21. Vaginal microbiota was characterized at enrollment and day 14 using species-specific quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: The median vaginal and cervical pH was significantly lower 2 hours after application of Acidform and was associated with an increase in the bactericidal activity of CVL against E. coli. However, 65% of women who received Acidform had at least one local adverse event compared with 11% who received placebo (p = 0.002). While there was no increase in inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, CVL concentrations of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), an anti-inflammatory protein, were significantly lower following Acidform compared to HEC placebo gel application. There were no significant changes in Lactobacillus crispatus or Lactobacillus jensenii in either group but there was a decrease in Gardnerella vaginalis in the Acidform group (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Acidform gel may augment mucosal defense as evidenced by an increase in bactericidal activity of genital secretions against E. coli and a decrease in Gardnerella vaginalis colonization. However, Acidform was associated with more irritation than placebo and lower levels of antimicrobial (lactoferrin) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1ra) proteins. These findings indicate the need for additional safety studies of this candidate non-hormonal contraceptive. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00850837.
TI  - Longitudinal qPCR study of the dynamics of L. crispatus, L. iners, A. vaginae, (sialidase positive) G. vaginalis, and P. bivia in the vagina.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To obtain more detailed understanding of the causes of disturbance of the vaginal microflora (VMF), a longitudinal study was carried out for 17 women during two menstrual cycles. METHODS: Vaginal swabs were obtained daily from 17 non-pregnant, menarchal volunteers. For each woman, Gram stains were scored, the quantitative changes of 5 key vaginal species, i.e. Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus crispatus, L. iners, (sialidase positive) Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia were quantified with qPCR and hydrogen-peroxide production was assessed on TMB+ agar. RESULTS: Women could be divided in 9 subjects with predominantly normal VMF (grades Ia, Ib and Iab, group N) and 8 with predominantly disturbed VMF (grades I-like, II, III and IV, group D). VMF was variable between women, but overall stable for most of the women. Menses were the strongest disturbing factor of the VMF. L. crispatus was present at log7-9 cells/ml in grade Ia, Iab and II VMF, but concentrations declined 100-fold during menses. L. crispatus below log7 cells/ml corresponded with poor H(2)O(2)-production. L. iners was present at log 10 cells/ml in grade Ib, II and III VMF. Sialidase negative G. vaginalis strains (average log5 cells/ml) were detected in grade I, I-like and IV VMF. In grade II VMF, predominantly a mixture of both sialidase negative and positive G. vaginalis strains (average log9 cells/ml) were present, and predominantly sialidase positive strains in grade III VMF. The presence of A. vaginae (average log9 cells/ml) coincided with grade II and III VMF. P. bivia (log4-8 cells/ml) was mostly present in grade III vaginal microflora. L. iners, G. vaginalis, A. vaginae and P. bivia all increased around menses for group N women, and as such L. iners was considered a member of disturbed VMF. CONCLUSIONS: This qPCR-based study confirms largely the results of previous culture-based, microscopy-based and pyrosequencing-based studies.
TI  - Association between Trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. Prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by Lactobacillus species (L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (CST) IV) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of Atopobium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, and other taxa. We sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and Trichomonas vaginalis. METHODS: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. T. vaginalis screening was performed using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA and beta-tubulin genes. Vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. A panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype T. vaginalis. The association between vaginal microbiota and T. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. RESULTS: T. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). Of the 11 T. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as CST-IV, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by L. iners, and 1 (9%) as L. crispatus-dominated (P = 0.05). CST-IV microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting T. vaginalis compared with women in the L. crispatus-dominated state (OR: 8.26, 95% CI: 1.07-372.65). Seven of the 11 T. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. CONCLUSION: T. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of Mycoplasma, Parvimonas, Sneathia, and other anaerobes.
TI  - Resolution and characterization of distinct cpn60-based subgroups of Gardnerella  vaginalis in the vaginal microbiota.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV), characterized by a shift of the vaginal microbiota from a Lactobacillus-dominated community to a dense biofilm containing a complex mixture of organisms, is an important risk factor in poor reproductive health outcomes. The Nugent score, based on Gram stain, is used to diagnose BV and Gardnerella vaginalis abundance in the sample is one factor determining Nugent score. A high Nugent score is indicative of BV but does not always correspond to the presence of clinical symptoms. G. vaginalis is recognized as a heterogeneous group of organisms, which can also be part of the normal, healthy vaginal microbiome. In addition, asymptomatic BV and non-Gardnerella types of BV are being recognized. In an attempt to resolve the heterogeneous group of G. vaginalis, a phylogenetic tree of cpn60 universal target sequences from G. vaginalis isolates was constructed that indicates the existence of four subgroups of G. vaginalis. This subdivision, supported by whole genome similarity calculation of representative strains using JSpecies, demonstrates that these subgroups may represent different species. The cpn60 subgroupings did not correspond with the Piot biotyping scheme, but did show consistency with ARDRA genotyping and sialidase gene presence. Isolates from all four subgroups produced biofilm in vitro. We also investigated the distribution of G. vaginalis subgroups in vaginal samples from Kenyan women with Nugent scores consistent with BV, Intermediate and Normal microbiota (n = 44). All subgroups of G. vaginalis were detected in these women, with a significant difference (z = -3.372, n = 39, p = 0.001) in frequency of G. vaginalis subgroup B between BV and Normal groups. Establishment of a quantifiable relationship between G. vaginalis subgroup distribution and clinical status could have significant diagnostic implications.
TI  - Characteristics of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against Gardnerella vaginalis by Lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (BV), and to select one of the better Lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive G. vaginalis isolates. A total of 24 isolates from women with and without BV were identified as G. vaginalis. A higher frequency (P<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with BV (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). A total of 86 strains of Lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (P<0.05) in healthy women (97.5%) than in women with BV (76.7%). Lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. In vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the G. vaginalis strains isolated from women with BV and from healthy women. Lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with BV. Concerning the indicator strains, G. vaginalis found in women with BV was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when Lactobacillus isolates from women with BV were used as producer strains. A high vaginal population level of G. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. A tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of G. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an L. johnsonii strain. Concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of G. vaginalis-associated BV depends in part on a simultaneous presence of Lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a G. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to this antagonism. The results could also explain why G. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.
TI  - Development and validation of a semiquantitative, multitarget PCR assay for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Quantitative PCR assays were developed for 4 organisms reported previously to be  useful positive indicators for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV)--Atopobium vaginae, Bacterial Vaginosis-Associated Bacterium 2 (BVAB-2), Gardnerella vaginalis, and Megasphaera-1--and a single organism (Lactobacillus crispatus) that has been implicated as a negative indicator for BV. Vaginal samples (n = 169), classified as positive (n = 108) or negative (n = 61) for BV based on a combination of the Nugent Gram stain score and Amsel clinical criteria, were analyzed for the presence and quantity of each of the marker organisms, and the results were used to construct a semiquantitative, multiplex PCR assay for BV based on detection of 3 positive indicator organisms (A. vaginae, BVAB-2, and Megasphaera-1) and classification of samples using a combinatorial scoring system. The prototype BV PCR assay was then used to analyze the 169-member developmental sample set and, in a prospective, blinded manner, an additional 227 BV-classified vaginal samples (110 BV-positive samples and 117 BV-negative samples). The BV PCR assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.7% (202/209), a specificity of 92.2% (153/166), a positive predictive value of 94.0%, and a negative predictive value of 95.6%, with 21 samples (5.3%) classified as indeterminate for BV. This assay provides a reproducible and objective means of evaluating critical components of the vaginal microflora in women with signs and symptoms of vaginitis and is comparable in diagnostic accuracy to the conventional gold standard for diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Extravaginal reservoirs of vaginal bacteria as risk factors for incident bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) represents shifts in microbiota from Lactobacillus spp. to diverse anaerobes. Although antibiotics relieve symptoms and temporarily eradicate BV-associated bacteria (BVAB), BV usually recurs. We investigated the role of extravaginal BVAB reservoirs in recurrence. METHODS: Risks for BV acquisition over the course of 1 year were defined. DNA in vaginal, anal, and oral swab samples from enrollment was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus crispatus, BVAB1, BVAB2, BVAB3, Megasphaera spp., Lactobacillus jensenii, and Leptotrichia/Sneathia spp. A case-control approach analyzed BVAB detection at enrollment for case patients (BV acquisition) versus controls (none). RESULTS: Of 239 women enrolled without BV, 199 were seen in follow-up, and 40 experienced BV; 15 had all samples for analysis. Detection of G. vaginalis in oral cavity or anal samples and Leptotrichia/Sneathia spp. in anal samples was more common at enrollment among case patients, who also had higher concentrations of these bacteria and Megasphaera relative to 30 controls at each site. In contrast, L. crispatus was detected more frequently in anal samples among controls. CONCLUSIONS: Women who acquire BV are more likely have previous colonization of extravaginal reservoirs with some BVAB, and less likely to have L. crispatus, suggesting that BVAB may be acquired vaginally from extravaginal reservoirs.
TI  - Inguinal syndrome secondary to Prevotella bivia after accidental bite in orogenital sex.
AB  - The authors report a case of an inguinal bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, Prevotella bivia, which was acquired during oral sexual intercourse. As far as the authors know, this is the first reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by Prevotella. Prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as Prevotella spp., Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes.
TI  - Detection of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  - To preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial DNA as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed PCR-based detection of 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from DNA extracted from body fluids and stains. As a result, 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii and Atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. Bacterial genes detected in female urine might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. In addition, those of Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus gasseri and Gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. Because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in DNA samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, DNA samples prepared for the identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. In conclusion, 16S ribosomal RNA genes of L. crispatus, L. jensenii and A. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
TI  - The natural antimicrobial peptide subtilosin acts synergistically with glycerol monolaurate, lauric arginate, and epsilon-poly-L-lysine against bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens but not human lactobacilli.
AB  - Subtilosin is a cyclical antimicrobial peptide produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens that has antimicrobial activity against the bacterial vaginosis-associated human pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis. The ability of subtilosin to inhibit G. vaginalis alone and in combination with the natural antimicrobial agents glycerol monolaurate (Lauricidin), lauric arginate, and epsilon-poly-L-lysine was tested using a checkerboard approach. Subtilosin was found to act synergistically with all of the chosen antimicrobials. These promising results indicate that lower concentrations of subtilosin in combination with other compounds could effectively be used to inhibit growth of the pathogen, thereby decreasing the risk of developed antimicrobial resistance. This is the first report on the effects of subtilosin combined with other natural antimicrobials against G. vaginalis.
TI  - Evidence for Gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. Gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species associated with BV, although its exact role in the pathology of BV is unknown. Using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that VK2 vaginal epithelial cells take up G. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. Confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized G. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with BV. Using VK2 cells and (35)S labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of G. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed G. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to Lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to Lactobacillus crispatus. Internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-D. In addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in VK2 cells exposed to G. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. Cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for G. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells. Finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of BV pathogenesis.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis in 2011: a lot of questions remain].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent vaginal affections. It results from a deep imbalance of the vaginal ecosystem whose mechanisms remain mysterious, even if recent progress were accomplished in their comprehension: if the flora implied in the bacterial vaginosis is recognized like polymorphic, it appears that Gardnerella vaginalis plays a major part with two genomically different forms: a commensal form (slightly adhesive to the epithelial cells), and a pathogenic one (strongly adhesive to the epithelial cells); the changes in lactobacilli are also to take into account: L. iners could be a marker of the vaginal flora imbalance whereas L. crispatus is generally met in the normal vaginal flora. These findings could influence the composition of coming probiotics; it is recognized that bacterial vaginosis is involved in the risk of prematurity but molecular quantification of G. vaginalis (and of Atopobium vaginae) is more sensitive for the diagnosis of BV what could improve the detection of high-risk pregnant women. The isolated antibiotic treatments are not very effective on the prevention of recurrences. The rebalancing of the vaginal flora is essential. In this field, the local estrogens showed some effectiveness. The use of probiotics is promising and can be recommended in complement of the antibiotic treatment even if the results of the clinical studies are still too heterogeneous to lead to precise indications.
TI  - Effect of sexual activity on vaginal colonization with hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis is associated with sexual activity, but mechanisms for this association are unclear. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from women reporting sex with women who provided information on sexual behaviors as part of a study of vaginal bacteria was conducted. Vaginal bacteria were detected by semiquantitative culture. Binomial regression with log-link evaluated associations between detection of bacteria and sexual behaviors reported to occur before enrollment. Linear regression evaluated associations between these behaviors and quantity of bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 320 women, 216 (68%) were colonized with H2O2-producing lactobacilli and 142 (44%) with Gardnerella vaginalis. Colonization with G. vaginalis was associated with >20 digital-vaginal sex acts (risk ratio, 2.01; 1.22, 3.29) or >10 toy-vaginal acts in the past 3 months (risk ratio, 1.76; 1.32, 2.36). Quantity of H2O2-producing lactobacilli was 1.3 log lower in colonized women reporting >10 acts of insertive vaginal sex-toy use in the past 3 months (95% confidence interval: -2.04, -0.56), 1.19 log lower with toy-vaginal sex in past 7 days (-1.75, -0.62), and 0.78 log lower in women sharing toys with a partner (-1.25, -0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal insertive use and sharing of sex toys were associated with decreased quantities of H2O2-producing lactobacilli and higher risk of colonization with G. vaginalis.
TI  - Multiplex detection of bacteria in complex clinical and environmental samples using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a recurring polymicrobial syndrome that is characterized by a change in the "normal" microbiota from Lactobacillus-dominated to a microbiota dominated by a number of bacterial species, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and others. This condition is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including HIV acquisition, and it can be difficult to manage clinically. Furthermore, diagnosis of BV has relied on the use of Gram stains of vaginal swab smears that are scored on various numerical criteria. While this diagnostic is simple, inexpensive, and well suited to resource-limited settings, it can suffer from problems related to subjective interpretations and it does not give a detailed profile of the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Recent deep sequencing efforts have revealed a rich, diverse vaginal microbiota with clear differences between samples taken from individuals that are diagnosed with BV compared to those individuals that are considered normal, which has resulted in the identification of a number of potential targets for molecular diagnosis of BV. These studies have provided a wealth of useful information, but deep sequencing is not yet practical as a diagnostic method in a clinical setting. We have recently described a method for rapidly profiling the vaginal microbiota in a multiplex format using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads with detection on a Luminex platform. This method, like current Gram stain-based methods, is rapid and simple but adds the additional advantage of exploiting molecular knowledge arising from sequencing studies in probe design. This method therefore provides a way to profile the major microorganisms that are present in a vaginal swab that can be used to diagnose BV with high specificity and sensitivity compared to Gram stain while providing additional information on species presence and abundance in a semi-quantitative and rapid manner. This multiplex method is expandable well beyond the range of current quantitative PCR assays for particular organisms, which is currently limited to 5 or 6 different assays in a single sample. Importantly, the method is not limited to the detection of bacteria in vaginal swabs and can be easily adapted to rapidly profile nearly any microbial community of interest. For example, we have recently begun to apply this methodology to the development of diagnostic tools for use in wastewater treatment plants.
TI  - Characteristics of patients with subchorionic hematomas in the second trimester.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the etiological characteristics of  patients diagnosed with subchorionic hematoma. METHODS: A case-controlled study was performed to compare characteristics of patients and controls. Via ultrasound examination, 47 pregnant patients were found to have subchorionic hematomas and 1075 had no evidence of subchorionic hematomas (controls). In the second trimester, patients were compared with regard to endocervical Chlamydia trachomatis and other vaginal microorganisms. RESULTS: The overall incidence of subchorionic hematomas in this pregnant population was 4.2%. Maternal clinical characteristics did not differ between cases and controls. Evaluation of the vaginal flora revealed that the positive rates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cases: 12.8%; controls: 4.1%; P<0.01) and Gardnerella vaginalis (cases: 12.8%; controls: 2.5%; P<0.001) in the cases were significantly higher than those of the controls. The negative rate of Lactobacillus in the cases was significantly higher than that of the controls (cases: 42.6%; controls: 27.6%; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with subchorionic hematoma in the first trimester showed changes in vaginal flora in the second trimester, which suggests a possible association with subchorionic hematoma and vaginal flora change.
TI  - Effects of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria and sexual intercourse on vaginal colonization with the probiotic Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), but their role in lactobacilli recolonization failure is unknown. We studied the effect of 7 BV-associated bacterial species and 2 Lactobacillus species on vaginal colonization with Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05 (LACTIN-V). METHODS: Twenty-four women with BV were given a 5-day course of metronidazole vaginal gel and then randomized 3:1 to receive either LACTIN-V or placebo applied vaginally once daily for 5 initial consecutive days, followed by a weekly application over 2 weeks. Vaginal swabs for L. crispatus CTV-05 culture and 9 bacterium-specific 16S rRNA gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were analyzed on several study visits for the 18 women receiving LACTIN-V. RESULTS: Vaginal colonization with CTV-05 was achieved in 61% of the participants receiving LACTIN-V at either day 10 or day 28 visit and 44% at day 28. Participants not colonized with CTV-05 had generally higher median concentrations of BV-associated bacteria compared to those who colonized. Between enrollment and day 28, the median concentration of Gardnerella vaginalis minimally reduced from 10 to 10 16S rRNA gene copies per swab in women who colonized with CTV-05 but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (P = 0.19). Similarly, the median concentration of Atopobium spp. reduced from 10 16S rRNA gene copies per swab to below limit of detection in women who colonized with CTV-05, but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (P = 0.04). The presence of endogenous L. crispatus at enrollment was found to be significantly associated with a reduced odds of colonization with CTV-05 on day 28 (P = 0.003), and vaginal intercourse during the study significantly impaired successful CTV-05 colonization (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Vaginal concentration of certain BV-associated bacteria, vaginal intercourse during treatment, and the presence of endogenous L. crispatus at enrollment predict colonization with probiotic lactobacilli.
TI  - The complex vaginal flora of West African women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. These methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in Africa where BV is highly prevalent. METHODS: An analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four West African countries. Samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had BV. Nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with BV were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. Excluding Lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. The prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and HIV status. In multivariate analysis, the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera elsdenii, Dialister, Mycoplasma hominis, Leptotrichia, and Prevotella were independently associated with BV as was the absence of Lactobacillus and Peptoniphilus. However, Mobiluncus, Atopobium vaginae, Anaerococcus, and Eggerthella were not independently associated with BV. Unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. BV cases with a simpler flora were less likely to respond to treatment. Overall, the vaginal flora of West African women with BV was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: what is physiological in vaginal bacteriology? An update and opinion.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was originally described as a sexually transmitted infection caused by a single microbe. The prevailing concept describes BV as a polymicrobial coitus-associated disease of uncertain origin. In this overview the natural history of BV as a monobacterial and polymicrobial entity is examined with respect to the physiological concept of BV in relation to sexual behavior before and after introduction of the hormonal contraceptive pill. Bacterial vaginosis, characterized by low vaginal acidity (elevated pH) and replacement of vaginal Lactobacillus by Gardnerella vaginalis flora, could be caused by unprotected intercourse when a low pH changes through the neutralizing power of male ejaculate, vaginal coital transudate and vaginal neurogenic transudate. A monobacterial form, G. vaginalis vaginitis, could be a physiological post-coital condition for protection of ejaculated spermatozoa, characterized by 'pure'Gardnerella flora and elevated pH as an immediate result of an incidental unprotected coital act through neutralization of vaginal acid and replacement of Lactobacillus by Gardnerella flora. A polymicrobial form of BV could be autoinfection of the post-coital physiological G. vaginalis flora, characterized by a mixture of G. vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and anaerobic bacteria at lower vaginal acidity, possibly resulting from suppression of normal vaginal acidity through repeated sexual acts, with a resultant higher pH and transfer of enteric bacteria from the perianal region. Monobacterial and polymicrobial auto-infectious forms of BV may be clinically distinct and share a common origin. The understanding of BV as a basic physiological entity could influence the prophylaxis and treatment of the largely therapy-resistant polymicrobial BV.
TI  - Lactobacillus johnsonii HY7042 ameliorates Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis by killing Gardnerella vaginalis and inhibiting NF-kappaB activation.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from women's vaginas and their anti-inflammatory effects against Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis were examined in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice. Oral and intravaginal treatment with five LABs significantly decreased viable G. vaginalis numbers in vaginal cavities and myeloperoxidase activity in mouse vaginal tissues. Of the LABs examined, Lactobacillus johnsonii HY7042 (LJ) most potently inhibited G. vaginalis-induced vaginosis. This LAB also inhibited the expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX-2, and iNOS, and the activation of NF-kappaB in vaginal tissues, but increased IL-10 expression. Orally administered LJ (0.2x10(8) CFU/mouse) also inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha by 91.7% in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice intraperitoneally injected with LPS. However, it increased IL-10 expression by 63.3% in these mice. Furthermore, LJ inhibited the expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and the activation of NF-kappaB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. LJ also killed G. vaginalis attached with and without HeLa cells. These findings suggest that LJ inhibits bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting the expressions of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha by regulating NF-kappaB activation and by killing G. vaginalis, and that LJ could ameliorate bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Self-collected vaginal swabs for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis and the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using self-collected vaginal specimens for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria versus practitioner-collected swabs. A cross-sectional study included 190 pregnant women enrolled before 20 weeks' gestation from September 2008 to November 2009. Self- and practitioner-collected swabs were taken during the same prenatal visit for each woman, qPCR assays performed for each, and the results compared. The quantification of the human albumin gene was used as an internal control to ensure sampling quality and accurate comparisons. The level of agreement of the qPCR assays for each microorganism was calculated with the Spearman product moment correlation coefficient and the kappa statistic. In all, 370 vaginal samples (185 self- and 185 practitioner-collected swabs) had a narrow range of values for the number of albumin gene copies and a significant correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho = 0.532; p < 0.001). The agreement between both sampling methods was excellent (Spearman's rho was 0.748 for Atopobium vaginae, 0.918 for Lactobacillus species, 0.940 for Gardnerella vaginalis; p < 0.001), especially for high concentrations of A. vaginae (>/=10(8) copies/mL; kappa value = 0.973; p < 0.001) and G. vaginalis (>/=10(9) copies/mL; kappa value = 0.903; p < 0.001). This study demonstrates the validity and reliability of self- versus practitioner-collected swabs for the molecular quantification of Lactobacillus species, G. vaginalis, and A. vaginae.
TI  - Intravaginal microbial flora by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Conventional diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis contains some controversial points. To understand accurately the relationship between clinical stages and the microbiotas, the intravaginal microbial flora was analyzed by the clone library method. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal fluid samples from 31 patients were examined. Lactobacillary grade, Nugent score, culture-based method, and clone library analysis using the 16SrRNA gene sequencing were performed and were compared with each other. RESULTS: Patients were categorized by Lactobacillary grade as I (normal) (n = 6), II (intermediate) (n = 11), and III (bacterial vaginosis) (n = 14). The clone library analysis detected 36 bacterial genera and 60 species from all 31 samples. A principal component analysis of the microbial proportions revealed a novel classification, which suggested the significance of the relative ratio of Lactobacillus iners, Atopobium vaginae and anaerobes in bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSION: Clone library analysis in combination with the conventional method provides substantial information for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Organism diversity between women with and without bacterial vaginosis as determined by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA gene sequence.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to characterize the different structures of microbial communities between 20 healthy women and 17 bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive women of reproductive age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vaginal samples from 17 BV-positive and 20 BV-negative women were subjected to DNA extraction, and amplified with eubacterial 16S rRNA gene-specific primers via polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products were separated using DGGE. Bands were excised, re-amplified, purified and sequenced. DNA sequences were compared with GenBank database. Phylip software packages were used to calculate sequencing data and form a phylogenetic tree to identify the genetic relations for microbiota inhabited in vaginal ecosystems of BV-positive women. RESULTS: In total, 28 kinds of organisms were detected that comprised BV(+) vagina microbial community, varying from three to nine kinds with an average of 5.71 kinds per woman. Only seven species were detected in BV(-) women, ranging between one and five species with an average of 2.40 species per woman, which was significantly lower than that detected in BV(+) women (t = 7.39, P < 0.001). A strain of Uncultured Lactobacillus sp. clone EHFS1_S05c (29/37; 78.38%) was most commonly presented in both BV-negative and BV-positive women, but the mean proportion of this Lactobacillus sp. strain to the whole microbial population colonized in the vaginal tract of BV(-) women was sharply higher than that calculated from BV(+) women (t = 2.92, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate further diversity in the category of vaginal microorganisms associated with BV. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis is not necessary as a sign for gynecologists to determine whether or not a woman is affected by BV.
TI  - Strong correspondence in bacterial loads between the vagina and rectum of pregnant women.
AB  - We sampled the vagina and rectum in 71 pregnant women and bacterial loads of Lactobacillus crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. iners, Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae were determined by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Culture and qPCR results differed substantially with regard to the evaluation of vaginal and rectal occurrence of the six species tested. The vaginal-rectal prevalence of L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. iners, G. vaginalis and A. vaginae as established by culture vs. PCR was 32.3 vs. 91.5%, 32.3 vs. 77.4%, 28.1 vs. 91.5%, 12.6 vs. 68.5%, 12.6 vs. 74.6% and 5.6 vs. 69.0%, respectively. Using qPCR, a significant positive correlation was found between vaginal and rectal loads of L. crispatus (p < 0.0001), L. jensenii (p < 0.0001), L. gasseri (p = 0.005), L. iners (p = 0.003) and A. vaginae (p = 0.002). In summary, significant correlations between quantities of vaginal and rectal lactobacilli and of Atopobium vaginae were established by means of qPCR, indicating strong correspondence of vaginal and rectal microflora, not only in the occurrence of certain species in both niches, but also of cell densities per bacterial species.
TI  - Disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  - The process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly understood. Likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. In order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. Challenge of E. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. However, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant E. coli killing. E. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of L. rhamnosus GR-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. Similarly challenge of BV biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated BV biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. Metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms. The findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.
TI  - Subtle perturbations of genital microflora alter mucosal immunity among low-risk  pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alteration in the vaginal flora has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of changes in individual microflora on genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women in early pregnancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Large, tertiary care, academic hospital clinic. POPULATION: Low-risk women were enrolled prior to 14 weeks' gestation. METHODS: Women were included if they had no medical or previous obstetrical complications, were non-smokers, had no sexually transmitted infections and no intercourse in the last 48 hours. Consenting women underwent speculum examination for collection of vaginal culture and Dacron swabs for cytokine analysis. Semi-quantitative vaginal cultures were performed in a reference laboratory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations of immune mediators were compared in the presence of various organisms. Concentrations were converted to multiples of the median to standardize the values of each mediator. Regression analyses were performed to control for race. RESULTS: We enrolled 47 women. The frequencies of genital microorganisms were: H(2)O(2) -producing lactobacilli (70%), Ureaplasma urealyticum (66%), Gardnerella vaginalis (45%), anaerobic non-pigmented Gram-negative rods (ANPGNR, 40%), anaerobic pigmented Gram-negative rods (APGNR, 17%). After adjusting for race and body mass index, interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were increased in the presence of G. vaginalis, ANPGNR, and APGNR. There was no consistent impact on the other markers of immune activation. CONCLUSION: The presence of individual species impacts genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women. Perturbations in genital immunity could partially explain heterogeneity in adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - Influence of menstruation on the microbiota of healthy women's labia minora as analyzed using a 16S rRNA gene-based clone library method.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the influence of menstruation on the bacterial population of healthy Japanese women's vulvas, especially the labia minora. Labia minora swabs were obtained from 10 premenopausal, nonpregnant Japanese women at premenstruation and on day 2 of menstruation. Vaginal swabs were also obtained from 3 out of the 10 women. No significant difference was found in the average bacterial cell count between the menstruation and premenstruation samples. Molecular analysis using a 16S rRNA gene-based clone library method detected 22 genera from the labia minora swabs (total 20), with the genus Lactobacillus being predominant at both premenstruation and during menstruation in 7 out of the 10 women. Of the other 3 women, 2 showed various kinds of bacterial species, including oral and fecal bacteria, with Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis predominating in the remaining woman's vulva in both conditions. In total, 6 out of 10 cases (60%) showed significantly different microbiota of the labia minora between the two conditions. These results imply that menstruation may promote a distortion of the bacterial flora around the vulva, although it causes no significant increase of the bacterial count.
TI  - [Susceptibility to antibiotics of microorganisms related with recurrent bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - There are presented data of sensitivity to a range of antibiotics of the main microorganisms related with the problem "recurrent bacterial vaginosis". G. vaginalis are sensitive in 34% to metronidazole, and 82% to clindamycin. Atopobium spp. and HP/+/Lactobacillus spp. are resistant to metronidazole and sensitive to clindamycin.
TI  - Inerolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by Lactobacillus iners.
AB  - Lactobacillus iners is a common constituent of the human vaginal microbiota. This species was only recently characterized due to its fastidious growth requirements and has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. Here we present the identification and molecular characterization of a protein toxin produced by L. iners. The L. iners genome encodes an open reading frame with significant primary sequence similarity to intermedilysin (ILY; 69.2% similarity) and vaginolysin (VLY; 68.4% similarity), the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Streptococcus intermedius and Gardnerella vaginalis, respectively. Clinical isolates of L. iners produce this protein, inerolysin (INY), during growth in vitro, as assessed by Western analysis. INY is a pore-forming toxin that is activated by reducing agents and inhibited by excess cholesterol. It is active across a pH range of 4.5 to 6.0 but is inactive at pH 7.4. At sublytic concentrations, INY activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and allows entry of fluorescent phalloidin into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Unlike VLY and ILY, which are human specific, INY is active against cells from a broad range of species. INY represents a new target for studies directed at understanding the role of L. iners in states of health and disease at the vaginal mucosal surface.
TI  - Response of Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm to 5 days of moxifloxacin treatment.
AB  - Polymicrobial communities are often recalcitrant to antibiotics. We tested whether the polymicrobial Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm can be eradicated with moxifloxacin. Twenty women with bacterial vaginosis were treated with 400 mg moxifloxacin for 5 days. The changes in the occurrence and proportions of Gardnerella, Atopobium and Lactobacillus spp. were assessed using FISH. The bacterial biofilm was investigated using desquamated epithelial cells of spontaneously voided urine and sections of vaginal biopsies. Fifteen of 20 women showed a significant and sustained clinical response to moxifloxacin according to Amsel and Nugent criteria. The concentrations of adherent bacteria decreased significantly. The incidence and proportion of Atopobium declined sustainably. The proportions of Lactobacillus in the biofilm mass increased following therapy. Initially, Gardnerella was the main component of the polymicrobial biofilm. Following treatment, Gardnerella was not accessible to FISH in the urine and vaginal samples of 75% of all women. Ten to 12 weeks after the end of therapy, Gardnerella biofilm was cumulatively present in 40%. This was not due to newly acquired disease, but due to reactivation of the persisting, but biochemically inactive biofilm. Despite clear clinical efficacy, and initially definite suppression of the biofilm, moxifloxacin was, similar to metronidazole, not able to eradicate the Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm in all patients.
TI  - Deep sequencing of the vaginal microbiota of women with HIV.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women living with HIV and co-infected with bacterial vaginosis (BV) are at higher risk for transmitting HIV to a partner or newborn. It is poorly understood which bacterial communities constitute BV or the normal vaginal microbiota among this population and how the microbiota associated with BV responds to antibiotic treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The vaginal microbiota of 132 HIV positive Tanzanian women, including 39 who received metronidazole treatment for BV, were profiled using Illumina to sequence the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Of note, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus iners were detected in each sample constituting core members of the vaginal microbiota. Eight major clusters were detected with relatively uniform microbiota compositions. Two clusters dominated by L. iners or L. crispatus were strongly associated with a normal microbiota. The L. crispatus dominated microbiota were associated with low pH, but when L. crispatus was not present, a large fraction of L. iners was required to predict a low pH. Four clusters were strongly associated with BV, and were dominated by Prevotella bivia, Lachnospiraceae, or a mixture of different species. Metronidazole treatment reduced the microbial diversity and perturbed the BV-associated microbiota, but rarely resulted in the establishment of a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Illumina based microbial profiling enabled high though-put analyses of microbial samples at a high phylogenetic resolution. The vaginal microbiota among women living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa constitutes several profiles associated with a normal microbiota or BV. Recurrence of BV frequently constitutes a different BV-associated profile than before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) prevention. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty healthy Chinese women with a history of recurrent BV were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (Probaclac Vaginal; Nicar Laboratories, Inc, Blainville, Quebec, Canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days on. RESULTS: Probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for BV (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; P < .001) and Gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; P = .02). Between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of BV and G vaginalis. Aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces BV recurrence and G vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.
TI  - Dissimilarity in the occurrence of Bifidobacteriaceae in vaginal and perianal microbiota in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Recent data point at the similarity between the perianal and vaginal microflora in terms of Lactobacillus species involved. Bacterial vaginosis, the most common perturbation of the vaginal microflora involving primarily overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis, has also been suggested to involve a recto-vaginal pathway. We addressed this issue with regard to bacteria of the Bifidobacteriaceae family. In particular, we investigated the putative concordance of the presence of G. vaginalis and a series of Bifidobacteria between the perianal and vaginal microflora in 10 patients with bacterial vaginosis through multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of desquamated epithelial cells. G. vaginalis was found in a biofilm mode of growth at the perianal and vaginal sites. In most women at least one of the following species was detected perianally: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breves, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. At the vaginal site, none of these Bifidobacteria was found. We conclude that bacterial vaginosis does not occur as a result of simple growth per continuum of perianal bacteria. Only some species originating from the intestinal tract do display pronounced vaginotropism, like G. vaginalis, whereas many other species do not.
TI  - Temporal variability of human vaginal bacteria and relationship with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about short-term bacterial fluctuations in the human  vagina. This study used PCR to assess the variability in concentrations of key vaginal bacteria in healthy women and the immediate response to antibiotic treatment in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-two women assessed for BV using Amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for 7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative PCR assays. Participants with BV were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole. Participants without BV had vaginal biotas dominated by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses. With onset of menstruation, quantities of Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus crispatus decreased and were found to be inversely related to Gardnerella vaginalis concentrations (p<0.001). Women with BV had a variety of fastidious bacteria whose concentrations dropped below detection thresholds 1-5 days after starting metronidazole. Recurrent BV was characterized by initial profound decreases of BV-associated bacteria after treatment followed by subsequent increases at relapse. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The microbiota of the human vagina can be highly dynamic. Healthy women are colonized with Lactobacillus species, but levels can change dramatically over a month. Marked increases in G. vaginalis were observed during menses. Participants with BV have diverse communities of fastidious bacteria that are depleted by vaginal metronidazole therapy. Women with recurrent BV initially respond to antibiotic treatment with steep declines in bacterial concentrations, but these bacteria later reemerge, suggesting that antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is not an important factor mediating BV recurrence.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: to study the clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis participating in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, which compared the vaginal use of preparations from red pepper tree and metronidazole for the treatment of genital discharge. METHODS: the study was conducted on a series of 277 women with bacterial vaginosis concomitantly diagnosed by the criteria of Amsel and Nugent, selected from a total of 462 recruited patients using the information obtained before intervention. Data were analyzed with the Epi-Info 3.32 software. In order to compare the outcomes frequencies between the intervention groups, the chi2 test was used and the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. The intention to treat analysis was performed. In addition to the determination of diagnostic parameters, the culture of vaginal content and a Papanicolaou cytology test were also performed. RESULTS: the most frequent clinical complaints were genital discharge, observed in 206 participants (74.4%) and the fish odor of the vaginal secretion, which occurred in 68.6% of the cases (190 patients). Among the diagnostic clinical criteria, the presence of clue-cells was positive in 275 women (99.3%), the Whiff test, in 266 (96.0%), followed by pH >4.5, which occurred in 92.8% of the cases, and by the presence of fluid grayish discharge reported by 206 participants (74.4%). Regarding the Nugent criterion, the median score was 8.0. Culture of the vaginal content permitted the identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in 96.8% of cases and of Mobiluncus in 53.1%. Only one third of the exams showed the presence of Lactobacillus (89 women - 32.1%). Fungal growth occurred in the cultures of 14 participants (5.1%). In most cases, culture revealed the presence of Corynebacterium (94.2%), Gram-positive cocci (98.2%), as well as Gram-positive (99.3%) and Gram-negative (91.0%) bacilli. Oncotic colposcopy revealed a very scarce presence of lactobacilli, which were present in only 8 cytological exams (2.9%) out of the total of 273 exams performed. CONCLUSIONS: the results of the present study did not differ from the literature regarding the symptoms reported by the women, the clinical criteria most frequently observed in the diagnosis, or the bacterial species detected in cultures of vaginal content. These findings indicate the need for further studies that might better elucidate the interrelations between the microbiological findings and the clinical expression of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  - The mechanism underlying the killing activity of Lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. Here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. In co-culture, the human intestinal strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and human vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 strains killed enteric Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344, vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis DSM 4944 and urinary tract Escherichia coli CFT073 pathogens. The cell-free culture supernatants (CFCSs) produced the same reduction in SL1344, DSM 4944 and CFT073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. The killing activity of CFCSs was heat-stable. In the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, CFCSs were less effective at killing of the pathogens. Catalase-treated CFCSs displayed a strong decreased activity. Tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. Lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only at concentrations higher than that present in CFCSs. In the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in Lactobacillus CFCSs, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of Lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.
TI  - High vaginal concentrations of Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis in women undergoing preterm labor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relationship between vaginal quantification of the main microorganisms related with bacterial vaginosis and the risk of preterm delivery among women with preterm labor. METHODS: Molecular methods were used to prospectively quantify Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Mycoplasma hominis in vaginal fluid samples from women admitted for spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes from July 2007 through July 2008. The primary outcome measure was the relationship between bacterial concentration at admission and preterm delivery, before 37 weeks of gestation. Sensitivity and specificity of molecular cutoff values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the University of British Columbia Bayesian Calculator type 2. RESULTS: Of the 90 women included, 36 delivered before 37 weeks of gestation (40%). Preterm delivery was not associated with the presence of Lactobacillus species, G vaginalis, A vaginae, or M hominis. In contrast, molecular quantification detected high concentrations of A vaginae (10(6)/mL or more: 25.0% in the preterm group and 9.3% in the term group, P=.04) and G vaginalis (10(7)/mL or more: 16.7% and 3.7%, P=.03) more often in women with preterm deliveries compared with term deliveries. Moreover, high vaginal concentrations of these two microorganisms together were associated with a significantly (P=.03) shorter interval between preterm labor and delivery (46 days, 95% CI 30-61) than were lower concentrations (85 days, 95% CI 75-95). The hazard ratio for a short preterm labor-to-delivery interval was three times higher for high vaginal fluid concentrations of A vaginae and G vaginalis than for lower concentrations (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.5, P=.03). CONCLUSION: The risk of preterm delivery is significantly associated with high vaginal concentrations of A vaginae and G vaginalis in women with preterm labor.

TI  - Glycerol monolaurate inhibits Candida and Gardnerella vaginalis in vitro and in vivo but not Lactobacillus.
AB  - We investigated the effects of glycerol monolaurate (GML) on Lactobacillus, Candida, and Gardnerella vaginalis human vaginal microflora. Our previous work demonstrated that 6 months of GML treatment vaginally does not alter lactobacillus counts in monkeys. Candida and G. vaginalis are commonly associated with vaginal infections in women, many becoming chronic or recurrent. In vitro growth inhibition studies determined the effects of GML (0 to 500 microg/ml) against multiple Candida species and G. vaginalis. A randomized, double-blind study investigated the effects of GML on vaginal microflora Lactobacillus, Candida, and G. vaginalis in colonized or infected women (n=36). Women self-administered intravaginal gels containing 0% (n=14), 0.5% (n=13), or 5% (n=9) GML every 12 h for 2 days. Vaginal swabs were collected before and immediately after the first gel administration and 12 h after the final gel administration. Swabs were tested for Lactobacillus, Candida, G. vaginalis, and GML. In vitro GML concentrations of 500 microg/ml were candicidal for all species tested, while a concentration of 10 microg/ml was bactericidal for G. vaginalis. Control and GML gels applied vaginally in women did not alter vaginal pH or Lactobacillus counts. Control gels reduced G. vaginalis counts but not Candida counts, whereas GML gels reduced both Candida and G. vaginalis. No adverse events were reported by participating women. GML is antimicrobial for Candida and G. vaginalis in vitro. Vaginal GML gels in women do not affect Lactobacillus negatively but significantly reduce Candida and G. vaginalis.
TI  - Comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. Thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. This study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) by quantitative culture and PCR methods. Main lactobacillus species include L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii and L. iners. METHODS: A total of 150 women attending Gynecology Outpatient Clinic of Beijing Friendship Hospital, were diagnosed as having BV because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of Amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal pH (pH > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of "clue" cells. Those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. Simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and Gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade I), intermediate (grade II), or consistent with BV (grade III). Gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using Vitek 2 Compact and PCR methods. Lactobacillus species were identified by PCR methods. Gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. RESULTS: BV was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. The majority of patients with BV had a smear assessed as grade III (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade II (9%, 4/46). The majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade I (64%, 67/104). Smears assessed as grade II were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. L. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with BV, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). L. gasseri, L. iners, and L. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of BV women, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The quantities of four lactobacillus species except L. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with BV. Our results provide support for the negative association between L. iners and L. gasseri. Although L. crispatus were existent both in healthy and BV positive women's vagina, the numbers of L. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. Smears of vaginal fluid and Gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.
TI  - In vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in Kenyan women.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. We sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess H2O2 production. Vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following BV treatment. One hundred and fifty eight Lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of the 107 women. Lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). Among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against BV-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth of Bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. respectively. The lactobacilli produced supernatants with a pH range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (pH 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. There was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). Acid, bacteriocins and H2O2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. These substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.
TI  - Multiplex detection of bacteria associated with normal microbiota and with bacterial vaginosis in vaginal swabs by use of oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a recurrent condition that is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases, preterm births, and pelvic inflammatory disease. In contrast to the Lactobacillus-dominated normal vaginal microbiota, BV is characterized by a lack of lactobacilli and an abundance of anaerobic and gram-negative organisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. To date, the laboratory diagnosis of BV has relied upon the fulfillment of criteria determined by microscopic observation of Gram-stained vaginal swabs. We describe a molecular-based method for the easy determination of the species profile within the vaginal microbiota based on the amplification of the chaperonin-60 genes of all bacteria present in the swab and hybridization of the amplicon to species-specific oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads that are identified by flow cytometry with a Luminex instrument. We designed a nineplex Luminex array for characterization of the vaginal microbiota and applied it to the analysis of vaginal swabs from individuals from Africa and North America. Using the presence of A. vaginae or G. vaginalis, or both, as the defining criterion for BV, we found that the method was highly specific and sensitive for the diagnosis of BV using microscopy as a gold standard.
TI  - Comparison of oral and vaginal metronidazole for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: impact on fastidious bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition that is associated with preterm birth and acquisition of complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include several fastidious species. Treatment of BV in pregnancy has mixed effects on the risk of preterm delivery, which some hypothesize is due to variable antibiotic efficacy for the fastidious bacteria. Both oral and intravaginal metronidazole can be used to treat bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, but little is known about the impact of different routes of antibiotic administration on concentrations of fastidious vaginal bacteria. METHODS: This was a sub-study of a larger randomized trial of oral versus vaginal metronidazole for treatment of BV in pregnancy. Fifty-three women were evaluated, including 30 women who received oral metronidazole and 23 who received intravaginal metronidazole. Bacterial taxon-specific quantitative PCR assays were used to measure concentrations of bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (BVAB) 1, 2, and 3, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium species, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Megasphaera species, and Lactobacillus crispatus before and after antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: Concentrations of Leptotrichia and Sneathia spp. and the fastidious Clostridia-like bacterium designated BVAB1 decreased significantly with oral (p = .002, p = .02) but not vaginal therapy (p = .141, p = .126). The fastidious bacterium BVAB3 did not significantly decrease with either treatment. Concentrations of Atopobium spp., reportedly resistant to metronidazole in vitro, dropped significantly with oral (p = .002) and vaginal (p = .001) treatment. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of change in bacterial concentrations between oral and vaginal treatment arms for any of the bacterial species. Lactobacillus crispatus concentrations did not change. CONCLUSION: Both oral and vaginal metronidazole therapy in pregnant women result in a significant decrease in concentrations of most BV-associated anaerobic bacteria, with the exception that Leptotrichia, Sneathia and BVAB1 do not significantly decrease with vaginal metronidazole therapy. These data suggest that the route of antibiotic administration has a minor impact on bacterial eradication in pregnant women with BV. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00153517.
TI  - Adhesion of human probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus to cervical and vaginal cells and interaction with vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The ability of a probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (Lcr35) to  adhere to cervical and vaginal cells and to affect the viability of two main vaginosis-associated pathogens, Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis, as well as Candida albicans was investigated. METHODS: Adhesion ability was determined in vitro with immortalized epithelial cells from the endocervix, ectocervix, and vagina. Coculture experiments were performed to count viable pathogens cells in the presence of Lcr35. RESULTS: Lcr35 was able to specifically and rapidly adhere to the three cell lines. In coculture assays, a decrease in pathogen cell division rate was observed as from 4 hours of incubation and bactericidal activity after a longer period of incubation, mostly with P. bivia. CONCLUSION: The ability of Lcr35 to adhere to cervicovaginal cells and its antagonist activities against vaginosis-associated pathogens suggest that this probiotic strain is a promising candidate for use in therapy.
TI  - Lactocin 160, a Bacteriocin Produced by Vaginal Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Targets  Cytoplasmic Membranes of the Vaginal Pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a commonly occurring vaginal infection that is associated with a variety of serious risks related to the reproductive health of women. Conventional antibiotic treatment for this condition is frequently ineffective because the antibiotics tend to inhibit healthy vaginal microflora along with the pathogens. Lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by healthy vaginal lactobacilli, is a promising alternative to antibiotics; this compound specifically inhibits the BV-associated vaginal pathogens such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia without affecting the healthy microflora. This study investigates the molecular mechanism of action for lactocin 160 and reveals that this compound targets the cytoplasmic membrane of G. vaginalis, causing the efflux of ATP molecules and dissipation of the proton motive force.
TI  - Preterm labor and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria among urban women.
AB  - AIMS: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects millions of women, is extremely prevalent  and is frequently chronic. We recognize numerous microbiologic variations among women with BV and this variability may explain the limited effectiveness of metronidazole in curing BV and/or reducing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) among BV-positive pregnant women. We assessed the independent role of seven common BV-associated bacteria on the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) among urban pregnant women. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted within an urban obstetrics practice at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. Fifty pregnant women with documented singleton pregnancies between 25-36 weeks' gestation from February 2007 through June 2007 who presented to the Labor and Delivery Unit for evaluation of uterine contractions/preterm labor were enrolled. RESULTS: We found that high median levels of Gardnerella vaginalis and low median levels of Lactobacillus crispatus were significantly predictive of SPTB. Slightly higher levels of Megasphaera-like species were also found among the group of women experiencing a SPTB during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Further identification of the individual attributable risk for separate BV-associated bacteria may be most useful in developing successful treatments to prevent SPTB among BV positive women.
TI  - Longitudinal trajectory of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterize the course of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and to discern the bacterial morphotypes responsible for infection. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal secretions were obtained in each trimester of pregnancy and were evaluated for bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain, categorized as normal or any of the following: Lactobacillus deficient, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, or Mobiluncus positive and by Nugent score. Results were evaluated for trends of bacterial vaginosis and Gram stain over pregnancy. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight women were evaluated. Seventy-one women (48%) were bacterial vaginosis negative in all trimesters, compared with 14 (9.4%) who were positive throughout pregnancy. Among the 14 women who remained bacterial vaginosis positive, Gram stain findings were Gardnerella+Bacteroides+Lactobacillus, with approximately 50% harboring Mobiluncus. Few women become bacterial vaginosis positive as pregnancy progressed (6.1%). With each increasing week of pregnancy, the risk of becoming bacterial vaginosis positive decreased (0.93: 0.91-0.95; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In this population, the majority of pregnant women trend toward bacterial vaginosis negative status. Few women are bacterial vaginosis positive across their pregnancy.
TI  - Quantitative variations in the vaginal bacterial population associated with asymptomatic infections: a real-time polymerase chain reaction study.
AB  - The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantification of several vaginal bacterial groups in healthy women and patients developing asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) and candidiasis (CA) was performed. Statistical analysis revealed that the BV condition is characterised by a great variability among subjects and that it is associated with a significant increase of Prevotella, Atopobium, Veillonella and Gardnerella vaginalis, and a drop in Lactobacillus. On the contrary, the vaginal microflora of healthy women and patients developing CA was found to be homogeneous and stable over time.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Molecular quantification of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. METHODS: Molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by Gram stain-based Nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for BV; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. A quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 BV-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. The targeted microorganisms were Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus species, Mobiluncus curtisii, Mobiluncus mulieris, and Candida albicans (which can be identified by Gram staining), as well as Atopobium vaginae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by Gram staining). RESULTS: With use of the Nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as BV, and 44 were classified as intermediate. Except for U. urealyticum, M. mulieris, and Lactobacillus species, DNA of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating BV, but the predictive value of such detection was low. The molecular quantification of A. vaginae (DNA level, > or = 10(8) copies/mL) and G. vaginalis (DNA level, > or = 10(9) copies/mL) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of BV, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a BV profile. When applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus sp in liquid-based cervical samples in healthy and disturbed vaginal flora using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  - Our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (LBC) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. And to use PCR technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish DNA patterns of the 16S RNA genes of the bacteria in the sample. Thirty samples were randomly selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(BoonFix)." PCR was used to amplify DNA of five bacterial species: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. The LBC slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. DNA of lactobacilli was detected in all cell samples. Seventeen smears showed colonization with Gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul BoonFix sample). Two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high DNA values for Gardnerella vaginalis and low values for Lactobacillus crispatus. The sample with the highest concentration for Gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal Gardnerella infection. This study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative PCR analysis. This cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal Gardnerella infection.
TI  - Atopobium vaginae triggers an innate immune response in an in vitro model of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder among women of reproductive age. The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis is poorly understood, but is defined by a transition in the vaginal flora from the predominant Lactobacillus species to other bacterial species such as Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis. This change is associated with an increase in vaginal cytokine secretion. We hypothesize that vaginal epithelial cells respond to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria by triggering an innate immune response. We observed that vaginal epithelial cells secreted interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in response to Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis, but not to Lactobacillus crispatus. Atopobium vaginae induced increased levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 transcripts, as well as increased transcripts for the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin 4. This innate immune response required live bacteria capable of protein synthesis in direct contact with vaginal epithelial cells. The response of vaginal epithelial cells was mediated by Toll-like receptor 2, required the adaptor protein MyD88, and involved activation of the NFkappaB signaling pathway. These results suggest that Atopobium vaginae stimulates an innate immune response from vaginal epithelial cells, leading to localized cytokine and defensin production, and possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Vaginal IL-8 levels are positively associated with Candida albicans and inversely with lactobacilli in HIV-infected women.
AB  - IL-8/CXCL8 is induced during infections, but has not been reported for Candida albicans colonization of the female genital tract. Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples were collected from 406 HIV-infected women. IL-8 levels were evaluated by ELISA and compared with levels of C. albicans detected by potassium hydroxide (KOH) and PCR. Levels of lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were also determined by PCR. IL-8 was significantly higher in samples from women with Candida, and regression analysis showed a positive association between IL-8 and Candida. In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between lactobacilli and IL-8. G. vaginalis and M. hominis were not significantly associated with IL-8. This study has shown an association between C. albicans and levels of IL-8 in mucosal genital fluid.
TI  - NATURAL ANTIMICROBIALS AND THEIR ROLE IN VAGINAL HEALTH: A SHORT REVIEW.
AB  - Lactobacillus species maintain the vaginal ecosystem in a healthy condition by production of antimicrobial substances. Depletion of lactobacilli in the vagina results in bacterial vaginosis (BV), where the normal flora is replaced by several bacterial pathogens, usually Gardnerella vaginalis and obligate anaerobes. BV may cause complications such as premature labor, low birth weight and increased risk of HIV acquisition. The currently recommended antibiotic treatments for BV are not always effective and often lead to reoccurrence of the infection. In many cases, this is due to the antibiotic-resistant forms of the pathogens. Therefore, there is an interest in the development of treatments using antimicrobials derived primarily from Lactobacillus spp., such as ribosomally produced antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) and lactic acid. These substances effectively inhibit pathogenic bacteria, are safe and do not pose any threat to healthy vaginal Lactobacillus spp. It may be possible to find an effective treatment against BV while reducing the infection's reoccurrence and the treatment-related complications through hurdle technology. This would be achieved by combining antimicrobials produced by Lactobacillus spp. with different natural antimicrobials obtained from plants or other non-pathogenic organisms.
TI  - The human vaginal bacterial biota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The bacterial biota of the human vagina can have a profound impact on the health  of women and their neonates. Changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of HIV infection. Cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (BV). PCR methods have shown that women with BV have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. The microbiology of BV is heterogeneous. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with BV suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.
TI  - Quantitative determination by real-time PCR of four vaginal Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between L. gasseri and L. iners.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. Here we applied existing real-time PCR formats for Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri and Gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for Atopobium vaginae, L. iners and L. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years. RESULTS: The 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the Ison and Hay criteria, as refined by Verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade Ia: 8 samples, grade Iab: 10, grade Ib: 13, grade I-like: 10, grade II: 11, grade III: 12 and grade IV: 7.L. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent Lactobacillus species detected. A significantly lower concentration of L. crispatus was found in grades II (p < 0.0001) and III (p = 0.002) compared to grade I. L. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade Iab than in grade Ia (p = 0.024). A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade III, with log10 median concentrations (log10 MC), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. Twenty (38.5%) of the 52 G. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for A. vaginae. In grade II we found almost no L. iners (log10 MC: 0/ml) but a high concentration of L. gasseri (log10 MC: 8.7/ml). By contrast, in grade III we found a high concentration of L. iners (log10 MC: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of L. gasseri (log10 MC: 0/ml). These results show a negative association between L. gasseri and L. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between L. gasseri and A. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In our study we found a clear negative association between L. iners and L. gasseri and between A. vaginae and L. gasseri. Our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade II is an intermediate stage between grades I and III, because L. gasseri, abundant in grade II is not predominant in grade III, whereas L. iners, abundant in grade III is present only in low numbers in grade II samples.
TI  - Symptomatic candidiasis: Using self sampled vaginal smears to establish the presence of Candida, lactobacilli, and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - In a prospective cohort study, 10 symptomatic women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis were taught how to prepare vaginal smears of their own vaginal fluids on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. The 40 smears were stained with the PAS-method and examined by three different cytopathologists for presence of Candida. Thereafter, the smears were restained with Giemsa-stain to determine presence of lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis ("clue cells") and neutrophils. All three cytopathologists unequivocally established Candida blastospores and (pseudo)hyphae in 27 out of the 40 PAS-stained vaginal smears, whereas in the remaining 13 smears Candida was not found. All 10 patients had Candida in their smears during the second half of their menstrual cycle.Self sampled smears prove to be reliable for establishing the presence of Candida in symptomatic patients with candidiasis. Candida is associated with a lactobacillus-predominated vaginal flora, but with the absence of Gardnerella vaginalis. Further studies may be directed towards the interaction between the various members of the vaginal flora. This study should open molecular methodology for determining the possible interactions of lactobacilli and Candida.
TI  - Probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (BV). There seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of BV. Many studies have suggested that the presence of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against BV, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. In-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce H2O2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing BV. Clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of L. acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of BV (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to Amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of BV, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. However, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of BV and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. Thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of BV are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.
TI  - [The bacterial vaginosis--treatment problems].
AB  - The changes in vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of H2O2 producing Lactobacillus spp. and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp.) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Bacterial vaginosis is associated with infectious complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and increasing risk of STI. The preventive role of natural vaginal microflora and problems of BV treatment are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - [Frequency of Gardnerella vaginalis in vaginal smears of hysterectomized women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work intended to evaluate the frequency of Gardnerella vaginallis in cervicalvaginal smears of hysterectomized women when compared to smears of non-hysterectomized women. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in the laboratory of pathology of the Western Sao Paulo University - Unoeste and 39,447 cervical/vaginal cytology reports were reviewed. Of these, 1934 women were totally hysterectomized and 37,513 were non-hysterectomized. Only data from Gardnerella vaginalis patients were collected (n=755) among the non-hysterectomized patients. RESULTS: There was a predominance of Lactobacillus species (60% of the cases) in the vaginal microbiota of hysterectomized patients with an incidence of Gardnerella vaginalis in 7.08% of the cases with a prevalence among the 41 to 50 year old age group (38 %). Among non-hysterectomized patients, 755 (2 %) had Gardnerella vaginalis and most patients were under 40 years of age (62%). CONCLUSION: Hysterectomized women are more than 3.71 times more likely to have Gardnerella vaginalis. Gardnerella vaginalis predominated in the 41 to 50 year old age group of hysterectomized women, and in the group of non-hysterectomized women with less than 40 years of age. Maintenance of the vaginal pH is important to prevent Gardnerella vaginalis infections and hysterectomized patients must take preventive care against this infection.
TI  - Rapid characterization of the normal and disturbed vaginal microbiota by application of 16S rRNA gene terminal RFLP fingerprinting.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent infection in women of reproductive age associated with numerous sequelae, including preterm delivery, amniotic fluid infections and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. The vaginal microbiota in BV patients is characterized by a shift from lactobacilli to a diverse spectrum of mostly anaerobic bacteria. In this study, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to characterize the vaginal bacterial communities from 50 women with BV and 20 healthy subjects. In the BV samples, 23 species or phylotypes from 17 genera could be identified, including Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera sp., Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis and three recently described phylotypes from the order Clostridiales. The number of detected species or phylotypes was on average 6.3 per sample (range 2-14). In contrast, in normal samples, only Lactobacillus species could be identified. In conclusion, T-RFLP provides a rapid and reliable technique to investigate the diversity of the predominant vaginal microbiota and allows differentiation of the flora of BV and healthy women. As such, T-RFLP may be helpful both in the diagnosis of BV from vaginal fluids and in a better understanding of the bacterial succession involved in the aetiology of BV.
TI  - An altered immunity hypothesis for the development of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The hypothesis is advanced that the transition from a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microflora to a microflora characteristic of bacterial vaginosis (BV), as well as development of the adverse consequences of BV in some women but not in others, are due to alterations in innate immunity. A microbial-induced inhibition of Toll-like receptor expression and/or activity may block induction of proinflammatory immunity and lead to the proliferation of atypical vaginal bacteria. A lack of 70-kDa heat-shock protein production and release in response to abnormal flora would compound this failure to activate antimicrobial immune responses. A deficit in vaginal mannose-binding lectin concentrations would further decrease the capacity for microbial killing and increase the likelihood of bacterial migration from the vagina to the upper genital tract.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus challenge on Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common infectious condition in women. It is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal pH, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. Gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. Microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable G. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). They maintained these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 produced the biggest displacement of Gardnerella. This was not due to pH, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain L. reuteri RC-14, high amounts by L. crispatus 33820 and not at all by L. rhamnosus GR-1. Deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense Gardnerella biofilm pods. For the first time, a strain of L. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal Lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. It was found to disrupt Gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than L. reuteri RC-14. These studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with Gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The International Infections in Pregnancy (IIP) study: variations in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of morphotypes in vaginal smears among pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the distribution of associated morphotypes among asymptomatic pregnant women in different countries. STUDY DESIGN: In 8 institutions participating in the Global Network for Perinatal and Reproductive Health (www.gnprh.org) from July 1999 to September 2001, 1466 women were enrolled. Vaginal smears were Gram stained and scored with Nugent's method at a reference laboratory. The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial morphotype distributions were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 12.3% of women had bacterial vaginosis according to Nugent's criteria. Zimbabwe had the highest prevalence (24.4%) when compared with all other sites, except Myanmar (P < .05). Among bacterial vaginosis cases, 98.9% of vaginal smears had more than 30 Gardnerella/Bacteroides morphotypes present per oil immersion field. Individual centers showed significant differences in the number of Mobiluncus and lactobacillus morphotypes (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of bacterial morphotypes in vaginal smears among asymptomatic pregnant women vary significantly in populations from different countries.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit Prevotella bivia and Gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia. Results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of G. vaginalis and P. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. The treatment of G. vaginalis- and P. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial HeLa cells with L. gasseri strain KS120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. The mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low pH and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the CFCSs. In addition, coculture of G. vaginalis or P. bivia with L. gasseri KS120.1 culture or KS120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto HeLa cells.
TI  - [Vaginosis in patients with antenatal foetus death].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of bacterial vaginosis as well as of vaginal anaerobe flora (Mycoplasma Hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus curtisii) was performed in women with antenatal foetus death. Specimens from forty women with this pathology were studied. Control group consisted of 100 pregnant women of the adequate age groups and gestation periods, but with live foetus. Vaginal smears treated by the use of polymerase chain reaction method showed that in the cases of antenatal foetus death in 70% of women Lactobacillus spp. was completely absent. This bacterium was observed only in 30% of these women. In 75% of women with live foetus Lactobacillus spp. was observed, while in 25% it was not present. Increase of quantity of anaerobic vaginal flora was observed in women, where the antenatal death of foetus was diagnosed. Percentage significance of these indices in women with live foetus was comparatively lower.
TI  - Reversible deficiency of antimicrobial polypeptides in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infections. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis has a much weaker association with sexually transmitted diseases. We found that vaginal lavage fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis is deficient in antimicrobial polypeptides and antimicrobial activity compared to fluid from healthy women or women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Effective treatment normalized the concentrations of antimicrobial polypeptides in both bacterial vaginosis and in vulvovaginal candidiasis, suggesting that the abnormalities were a result of the diseases. Unlike in vulvovaginal candidiasis, the neutrophil attractant chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) was not increased in bacterial vaginosis, accounting for low concentrations of neutrophil-derived defensins in vaginal fluid. In organotypic cultures of human vaginal epithelium containing dendritic cells, treatment with Lactobacillus jensenii, a typical vaginal resident, induced the synthesis of IL-8 mRNA and the epithelial human beta-defensin-2 mRNA, but a typical bacterial vaginosis pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis, had no effect. When the two bacteria were combined, Gardnerella vaginalis did not interfere with the immunostimulatory effect of Lactobacillus jensenii. The loss of normal immunostimulatory flora in bacterial vaginosis is thus associated with a local deficiency of multiple innate immune factors, and this deficiency could predispose individuals to sexually transmitted diseases.
TI  - Selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  - Two strains of Lactobacillus crispatus (15L08 and 21L07) and one strain of Lactobacillus jensenii (5L08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of H2O2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. All three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans. Lactobacillus crispatus 15L08 was characterized as a potential H2O2 producer. A high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by L. jensenii 5L08, with a bactericidal mode of action for G. vaginalis, C. albicans and Escherichia coli. However, H2O2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of C. albicans. Simultaneous actions of H2O2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. These strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus helveticus strain KS300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the Lactobacillus helveticus strain KS300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia, uropathogenic Escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. METHODS AND RESULTS: The KS300 strain inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis, P. bivia, S. typhimurium, and pathogenic E. coli. After direct co-culture, data show that the Lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of G. vaginalis, P. bivia, S. typhimurium, and pathogenic E. coli. The adhering KS300 strain inhibited the adhesion of G. vaginalis DSM 4944 and uropathogenic Dr-positive E. coli IH11128 onto HeLa cells. Moreover, the KS300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic Dr-positive E. coli IH11128 within HeLa cells and S. typhimurium SL1344 within Caco-2/TC7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that L. helveticus strain KS300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Adhering L. helveticus strain KS300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.
TI  - Prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. From vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. Then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. These six strains were found to belong to three distinct species: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. jensenii and L. vaginalis. One strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. These three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (FOS Actilight and FOS Raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 GOS and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 GOS). The test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as Candida albicans, Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis. Oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by HPLC analysis. This revealed that two oligosaccharide series (FOS Actilight DP3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 GOS DP > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. The selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.
TI  - Inhibition of Gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacilli.
AB  
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Atopobium vaginae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, Atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of BV. METHODS: Nine strains of Atopobium vaginae, four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of Lactobacillus iners and one strain each of Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the Etest. RESULTS: All nine strains of A. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). We found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2 to more than 256 microg/ml. The four G. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. All lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: Clindamycin has higher activity against G. vaginalis and A. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all A. vaginae isolates are metronidazole resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on a more limited number of strains.
TI  - Treatment and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: current and future  perspectives.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis accounts for the majority of cases of vaginal discharge and has been consistently linked to an increased risk of preterm delivery. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by the reduced number or absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp., which promotes the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Bacteroides spp., and Mobiluncus spp. Black race, higher-risk sexual activity, frequent vaginal douching and the substantial reduction of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp. are the main predictors of bacterial vaginosis development. Clinical- and laboratory-based bacterial vaginosis diagnostic tests are widely used to screen for bacterial vaginosis but, more recently, office-based bacterial vaginosis screening tools have been developed. Although systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or clindamycin has been demonstrated to be effective in the short-term cure of bacterial vaginosis, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis within 3 months of treatment is common, and treatment for bacterial vaginosis using these strategies has not been effective in reducing the risk of preterm delivery.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis affects millions of women and is associated with  several serious health conditions. The cause of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood despite numerous studies based on cultures. Bacteria in microbial communities can be identified without cultivation by characterizing their ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences. METHODS: We identified bacteria in samples of vaginal fluid with a combination of broad-range polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplification of 16S rDNA with clone analysis, bacterium-specific PCR assay of 16S rDNA, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed directly on vaginal fluid from 27 subjects with bacterial vaginosis and 46 without the condition. Twenty-one subjects were studied with the use of broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, and 73 subjects were studied with the use of bacterium-specific PCR. RESULTS: Women without bacterial vaginosis had 1 to 6 vaginal bacterial species (phylotypes) in each sample (mean, 3.3), as detected by broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, and lactobacillus species were the predominant bacteria noted (83 to 100 percent of clones). Women with bacterial vaginosis had greater bacterial diversity (P<0.001), with 9 to 17 phylotypes (mean, 12.6) detected per sample and newly recognized species present in 32 to 89 percent of clones per sample library (mean, 58 percent). Thirty-five unique bacterial species were detected in the women with bacterial vaginosis, including several species with no close cultivated relatives. Bacterium-specific PCR assays showed that several bacteria that had not been previously described were highly prevalent in subjects with bacterial vaginosis but rare in healthy controls. FISH confirmed that newly recognized bacteria detected by PCR corresponded to specific bacterial morphotypes visible in vaginal fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Women with bacterial vaginosis have complex vaginal infections with many newly recognized species, including three bacteria in the Clostridiales order that were highly specific for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Comparison between Gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade I microflora and revised categorization of grade I microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using Nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on Gram stained slides of vaginal smears. Ison and Hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the Streptococcus cell type. Because in the Nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard Gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the Gram stain. To this purpose we compared Gram stain based categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific PCR for the detection of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae and with ii) tDNA-PCR for the identification of most cultivable species. RESULTS: A total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade I microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade II, 22 (4.3%) as grade III and 8 (1.6%) as grade IV, according to the criteria of Ison and Hay. Another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade I-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. We found that 52.7% of the grade I-like samples contained Bifidobacterium spp. while L. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade II specimens.Based on the presence of different Lactobacillus cell types, grade I specimens were further characterized as grade Ia (40.2%), grade Iab (14.9%) and grade Ib (44.9%). We found that this classification was supported by the finding that L. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade Ia and Iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade Ib specimens, a category in which L. gasseri and L. iners were predominant. CONCLUSION: Further refinement of Gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade I smears (Ia, Iab and Ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade I-like. A strong correlation was found between grade Ia and the presence of L. crispatus and between grade I-like and the presence of bifidobacteria. This refinement of Gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.
TI  - Variation in microbiologic profiles among pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if clinical findings and sociodemographic variables among bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive pregnant women are associated with different microbiologic profiles. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women were assessed for BV by Nugent criteria. BV+ women were separated into 6 mutually exclusive microbiologic groups. In unadjusted analyses, we compared (1) sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and (2) 3 clinical characteristics among BV+ women with and without Mobiluncus (M+ vs M-). Unadjusted data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of having clinical signs of BV in women with and without Mobiluncus spp while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 1756 BV+ pregnant women were followed. The M+ group (n=702) was significantly more likely than the M- group (n=1054) to be non-Hispanic black (80.9% vs 66.2%; P < .0001), older than 21 years (61.7% vs 48.7%; P < .0001), and to have had more than 3 lifetime sexual partners (66.4% vs 54.9%; P < .0001). The M+ group was also more likely to have clue cells on wet mount (63.9% vs 47.2%; P < .0001) and a positive amine odor after addition of KOH (57.2% vs 45.0%; P=.001). There was no difference in other demographic variables or physician diagnosis of abnormal vaginal discharge. In the adjusted analyses for each clinical outcome, all findings were consistent with the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: BV+ pregnant women with Mobiluncus spp are more likely to have clue cells present on wet mount, a positive amine odor after KOH preparation, and to be older, non-Hispanic black, and have had more lifetime sexual partners compared to BV+ women without any Mobiluncus species.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal microflora of healthy, nonpregnant women by chaperonin-60 sequence-based methods.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. STUDY DESIGN: Asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. Total genomic DNA was isolated from the vaginal swabs. Degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic DNA and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. Library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. Presence of Chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by Nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. Vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to Lactobacillus spp L. crispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, and L. buchneri. Other sequences that were identified included representatives of Gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to Porphyromonas spp and Megasphaera spp and sequences identical to C psittaci. CONCLUSION: Culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that were not previously associated with vaginal flora.
TI  - Utility of Amsel criteria, Nugent score, and quantitative PCR for Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Lactobacillus spp. for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinical syndrome presenting with a malodorous vaginal discharge and increased vaginal pH. Diagnosis has been based on clinical Amsel criteria and direct Gram stain of vaginal secretions. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study contributed cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples. Lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis in cervicovaginal lavage samples were quantified by PCR. Gynecologic evaluation included Nugent score and Amsel criterion assessment. We compared the gold standard Nugent score to Amsel criteria and quantitative bacterial PCR for diagnosing BV in 203 CVL samples from women with Nugent scores of 7 to 10 (BV group) and 203 samples from women with BV Nugent scores of 0 to 3 ("No-BV" group). Only 75 of the 203 CVL samples from women with Nugent scores of 7 to 10 met positive Amsel criteria. Increasing levels of G. vaginalis and M. hominis and decreasing levels of lactobacilli were significantly associated with BV by Nugent score. Of the group with Nugent scores of 7 to 10, 83% and 81% had log(10) G. vaginalis counts and log(10) M. hominis counts greater than 6.81 and 4.82, respectively, while only 30% and 31% of the group with Nugent scores of 0 to 3 were above these thresholds, respectively. There was significant overlap in the log(10) lactobacillus counts between the two groups. Utilizing all three log(10) bacterial counts (G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and lactobacilli) in our model improved the sensitivity and specificity to 83% and 78%, respectively, in comparison with Nugent score. In this cohort, Amsel criteria were poorly predictive of BV. PCR quantification of G. vaginalis and M. hominis from CVL is significantly more sensitive than Amsel criteria for diagnosing BV.
TI  - A cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Women (N = 1,140) were ascertained at five US centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. Serial vaginal swabs were obtained for Gram's stain and cultures. PID was defined as 1) histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees C, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. Exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. The first correlated with BV by Gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to a lesser degree, Ureaplasma urealyticum. The second, unrelated to BV by Gram's stain, consisted of Enterococcus species and Escherichia coli. Being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of BV-associated microorganisms increased PID risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). Carriage of non-BV-associated microorganisms did not increase PID risk. Women with heavy growth of BV-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). When identified by microbial culture, a combination of BV-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring PID.
TI  - Complexity of vaginal microflora as analyzed by PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in a patient with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gardnerella vaginalis has long been the most common pathogen associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). We aimed to test our hypothesis that symptoms and signs of BV do not necessarily indicate colonization by this organism, and often will not respond to standard metronidazole or clindamycin treatment. METHODS: Using a relatively new molecular tool, PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), the vaginal microflora of a woman with recalcitrant signs and symptoms of BV was investigated over a 6-week timeframe. RESULTS: The vagina was colonized by pathogenic enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Candida albicans. The detection of the yeast by PCR-DGGE is particularly novel and enhances the ability of this tool to examine the true nature of the vaginal microflora. The patient had not responded to antifungal treatment, antibiotic therapy targeted at anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens such as Gardnerella, nor daily oral probiotic intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The failure to find the GG strain in the vagina indicated it did not reach the site, and the low counts of lactobacilli demonstrated that therapy with this probiotic did not appear to influence the vaginal flora. CONCLUSIONS: BV is not well understood in terms of its causative organisms, and further studies appear warranted using non-culture, molecular methods. Only when the identities of infecting organisms are confirmed can effective therapy be devized. Such therapy may include the use of probiotic lactobacilli, but only using strains which confer a benefit on the vagina of pre- and postmenopausal women.
TI  - Frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis in non- and hysterectomized women.
AB  - The frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis has shown varying results. Bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis are infections related to vaginal pH alteration. Vaginal pH is related to endocervical pH in pre- and post-menopaused women, and vaginal pH in hysterectomized women is more acidic than in non-hysterectomized women. The aim of this paper is to verify differences in Papanicolaou smear diagnoses of infectious agents in hysterectomized women. A retrospective study was conducted at Faculdade de Medicina do Triangulo Mineiro (public tertiary referral centre). A total of 1,579 Papanicolaou reports for each group (hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized) was analysed. Clue cells, Candida sp., Trichomonas vaginalis, cytolysis, coccobacilli and lactobacilli were diagnosed by cytological criteria (Papanicolaou's method), statistical methods: the chi2 test and linear regression (significance level < 0.05). Clue cells decrease with the age in both the groups and are more frequent in non-hysterectomized women with > 59 years. There is an increased frequency of Coccobacilli and a decrease of lactobacillus as the age of women increases. The frequency of T. vaginalis is not influenced by hysterectomy but there is a decreased frequency between 40 years and 49 years old. Cytolysis was more frequent in women below 40 years old and between 50 years and 59 years old in both groups (P < 0.009). Candida sp. is a less common finding between 40 years and 49 years old in both groups and more frequent in hysterectomized women with > 60 years old (P = 0.002). Our results showed that the presence of infectious agents for vaginitis in Papanicolaou findings is associated with age. The frequency of finding of Candida sp. in women above 60 years old may be influenced by hysterectomy.
TI  - Normal ocular flora in newborns delivered in two hospital centers in Argentina and Paraguay.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the spectrum of normal conjunctival flora in newborns in two hospital centers in North Argentina and Paraguay. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, conjunctival specimens were obtained from the right eyes of newborns prior to the application of any topical medications. Culture samples were also obtained from the cervicovaginal secretions of the infants' mothers. All samples were directly inoculated into culture media and all growth were identified and quantified. RESULTS: Among the 190 newborns studied, 126 were delivered vaginally and 64 via caesarean section (C-section). A total of 180 different bacterial strains were acquired from the vaginally delivered infants and 77 from the C-section group (P=0.078, Student's t-test). Conjunctival cultures obtained within one hour of birth showed that 85 out of 101 samples (84%) from both the vaginal and C-section group had positive cultures, compared to 84 out of 89 samples (94%) obtained more than 1 h after birth (P<0.001). Among the vaginally delivered newborns, the most common bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (in 69 samples, 38%), Propionibacterium spp (36, 20%) and Corynebacterium spp (29, 16%). In the CES, the most common isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (39, 51%), Propionibacterium spp (22, 29%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6, 8%). There was a significantly higher proportion of gram-positive rods (P=0.017) isolated from infants delivered vaginally (16%) than from those delivered by C-section (5%). No Neisseria gonorrhoeae were isolated in conjunctival samples. Among the 130 organisms isolated from cervicovaginal secretions in 81 out of 189 mothers, the most common organisms were Lactobacillus spp. (47%), Corynebacterium spp (21%), Gardnerella vaginalis (15%), and Candida spp (14%). No Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis were found in cervicovaginal samples. CONCLUSION: The most common conjunctival bacteria in newborns delivered by either vaginal birth or C-section were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The proportion of positive conjunctival cultures was higher for infants delivered vaginally than for C-section delivery.
TI  - Induction of secretory aspartyl proteinase of Candida albicans by HIV-1 but not HSV-2 or some other microorganisms associated with vaginal environment.
AB  - The most common type of candidiasis involves mucosal sites such as the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. Among many of virulence factors, the production of secretory aspartyl proteinase (Sap) by Candida albicans (C. albicans) has gained much attention, and factors leading to Sap induction are thus under intense study. The aim of this study was to examine whether some microorganisms such as Lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis), human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) had any Sap inducing effect on C. albicans. Here we showed that among the microorganisms tested in vitro only HIV-1 induced Sap production from C. albicans.
TI  - Vaginal flora morphotypic profiles and assessment of bacterial vaginosis in women at risk for HIV infection.
AB  - Specific morphotypic profiles of normal and abnormal vaginal flora, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), were characterized. A prospective study of 350 women yielded concurrent Gram-stain data and clinical assessment (n = 3455 visits). Microbiological profiles were constructed by Gram stain. Eight profile definitions were based on dichotomizing the levels of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and curved, Gram-negative bacillus (Mobiluncus) morphotypes. Of these, two were rare, and the other six demonstrated a graded association with the clinical components of BV. The proposed profiles from the Gram stain reflect the morphotypic categories describing vaginal flora that may enable clearer elucidation of gynecologic and obstetric outcomes in various populations.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis, vaginal flora patterns and vaginal hygiene practices in patients presenting with vaginal discharge syndrome in The Gambia, West Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) - a syndrome characterised by a shift in vaginal flora - appears to be particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known of the pattern of vaginal flora associated with BV in Africa. We conducted a study aimed at determining the prevalence of BV and patterns of BV-associated vaginal micro-flora among women with vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) in The Gambia, West Africa. METHODS: We enrolled 227 women with VDS from a large genito-urinary medicine clinic in Fajara, The Gambia. BV was diagnosed by the Nugent's score and Amsel's clinical criteria. Vaginal swabs were collected for T vaginalis and vaginal flora microscopy, and for Lactobacillus spp, aerobic organisms, Candida spp and BV-associated bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma spp) cultures; and cervical swabs were collected for N gonorrhoeae culture and C trachomatis PCR. Sera were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Sexual health history including details on sexual hygiene were obtained by standardised questionnaire. RESULTS: BV prevalence was 47.6% by Nugent's score and 30.8% by Amsel's clinical criteria. Lactobacillus spp were isolated in 37.8% of women, and 70% of the isolates were hydrogen-peroxide (H202)-producing strains. Prevalence of BV-associated bacteria were: G vaginalis 44.4%; Bacteroides 16.7%; Prevotella 15.2%; Peptostretococcus 1.5%; Mobiluncus 0%; other anaerobes 3.1%; and Mycoplasma hominis 21.4%. BV was positively associated with isolation of G vaginalis (odds-ratio [OR] 19.42, 95%CI 7.91 - 47.6) and anaerobes (P = 0.001 [OR] could not be calculated), but not with M hominis. BV was negatively associated with presence of Lactobacillus (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.03 - 0.15), and H2O2-producing lactobacilli (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.28). Presence of H2O2-producing lactobacilli was associated with significantly lower prevalence of G vaginalis, anaerobes and C trachomatis. HIV prevalence was 12.8%. Overall, there was no association between BV and HIV, and among micro-organisms associated with BV, only Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. were associated with HIV. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with any of the factors relating to sexual hygiene practices (vaginal douching, menstrual hygiene, female genital cutting). CONCLUSION: In this population, BV prevalence was higher than in corresponding populations in industrialised countries, but the pattern of vaginal micro-flora associated with BV was similar. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with HIV nor with any of the vaginal hygiene characteristics.
TI  - [Frequency, diagnostic criteria and consequences of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women].
AB  - Vaginal discharge based on changes in a vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of Lactobacillus and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with: preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid infection, endometritis, low-weight neonates. The role of natural microflora of vagina, the most important diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and immunological changes in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - [Study of acute vulvovaginitis in sexually active adult women, with special reference to candidosis, in patients of the Francisco J. Muniz Infectious Diseases Hospital].
AB  - The results of microbiological vaginal secretions samples obtained from 749 women (from July 2001 to July 2002) were studied in the Bacteriology Unit of the Francisco Javier Muniz Hospital from Buenos Aires. All patients suffered acute vulvovaginitis were child bearing and sexually active women, 334 of them were HIV-positive. The following are the results of the microbiological studies: Lactobacillus spp 50.6%, Gardnerella vaginalis 25.6%, Candida spp 17.4%, Trichomonas vaginalis 5.3%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.3% and B group Streptococcus 0.8%. Candida vaginitis was significantly more frequent in HIV-positive patients, (21.6% vs 14%; p = 0.0086); meanwhile, trichomoniasis was less common although the difference was not statistically significant (3.6 vs 6.7%, p = 0.0810). The following Candida species were isolated in this study: Candida albicans 76.8%, Candida glabrata 15.6%, Candida parapsilosis 2.9%, Candida tropicalis 1.5% and Candida krusei 0.7%. Eight cases (6.2%) of vaginitis were produced by two Candida species (C. albicans and C. glabrata), and in three cases (2.17%) Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated. Five women suffering acute vaginitis with Candida spp presented another etiologic agent of vaginal infection, three cases T. vaginalis and two cases G. vaginalis. The following are some of the most important findings of this study: 1) Half of the patients presented a normal microbial biota; 2) Candida spp vaginitis was significantly more frequent among HIV-positive women; 3) we observed a high incidence of Candida glabrata infections (15.9%), 4) 6.2% of vaginal candidiasis were caused by more than one Candida species and, 5) the susceptibility pattern of C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates against fluconazole was similar to the one observed in other studies. The majority of C. albicans isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (MIC90 = 0.5 microg/ml) meanwhile C. glabrata strains were much less susceptible to this drug (MIC50 and MIC90 = 32 microg/ml).
TI  - Female genital-tract HIV load correlates inversely with Lactobacillus species but positively with bacterial vaginosis and Mycoplasma hominis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition. We examined the association between BV and BV-associated bacteria and expression of HIV in the female genital tract. METHODS: HIV RNA, lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples were quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Gynecologic evaluation included Nugent score assessment, Amsel criteria assessment, detection of other genital-tract infections, and dysplasia grading. CD4 cell count, plasma HIV RNA level, and antiretroviral history were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 203 CVL samples from women with Nugent scores of 7-10 (BV group) and 203 samples from women with Nugent scores of 0-3 (no-BV group) were matched by plasma HIV RNA level and analyzed. After controlling for plasma HIV RNA level and Nugent score in univariate analyses, we found that G. vaginalis and M. hominis bacterial counts, Candida vaginitis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) were positively associated with CVL HIV RNA levels. In multivariate analysis, only lactobacilli bacterial counts (P=.006; inverse association), M. hominis bacterial counts (P=.0001; positive association), Candida vaginitis (P=.007), and HSV (P=.03) were significantly associated with CVL HIV RNA levels. CONCLUSION: Bacteria associated with BV increase genital-tract HIV RNA levels. Quantitative bacterial counts for lactobacilli and M. hominis are better correlates of CVL HIV RNA than are Nugent score or Amsel criteria. Since plasma virus and CD4 cell levels did not differ between the BV and no-BV groups, these data suggest that the bacterial flora associated with BV influence genital-tract HIV shedding.
TI  - Evolving issues in understanding and treating bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a synergistic polymicrobial syndrome characterized by depletion of Lactobacillus spp., especially those that produce hydrogen peroxide, and an intense increase in the quantity of commensal vaginal anaerobic bacteria to 100- to 1000-fold above normal levels. While the bacterial spectrum of these organisms has long been known to include Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, Mobiluncus spp. and Mycoplasma hominis, innovative use of molecular diagnostics has identified novel species apparently associated with this syndrome, including Atopobium vaginalis. Effecting resolution of bacterial vaginosis is important, in particular for the 8 to 23% of women afflicted with symptomatic disease during their reproductive years. Bacterial vaginosis has been consistently associated with numerous adverse sequelae related to the upper genital tract, including pelvic inflammatory disease and postsurgical infection in the setting of invasive gynecologic procedures, and may increase women's risk of acquiring HIV infection. Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis experience a higher rate of preterm delivery and low-birth-weight infants. While antibiotics with activity against anaerobes--typically, metronidazole and clindamycin applied vaginally or taken orally--are the mainstays of therapy, bacterial vaginosis frequently recurs. For these reasons, innovative approaches to therapy are urgently required.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis commonly is found in women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), but it is unclear whether bacterial vaginosis leads to incident PID. METHODS: Women (n = 1,179) from 5 U.S. centers were evaluated for a median of 3 years. Every 6-12 months, vaginal swabs were obtained for gram stain and culture of microflora. A vaginal microflora gram stain score of 7-10 was categorized as bacterial vaginosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed by presence of either histologic endometritis or pelvic pain and tenderness plus one of the following: oral temperature greater than 38.3 degrees C; sedimentation rate greater than 15 mm/hour; white blood count greater than 10,000; or lower genital tract detection of leukorrhea, mucopus, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant demographic and lifestyle factors, baseline bacterial vaginosis was not associated with the development of PID (adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.55-1.45). Carriage of bacterial vaginosis in the previous 6 months before a diagnosis (adjusted risk ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.71-2.42) also was not significantly associated with PID. Similarly, neither absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus nor high levels of Gardnerella vaginalis significantly increased the risk of PID. Dense growth of pigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods in the 6 months before diagnosis did significantly increase a woman's risk of PID (P =.04). One subgroup of women, women with 2 or more recent sexual partners, demonstrated associations among bacterial vaginosis, Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and PID. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of high-risk women, after adjustment for confounding factors, we found no overall increased risk of developing incident PID among women with bacterial vaginosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: comparison of Pap smear and microbiological test results.
AB  - Our purpose was to determine the reliability of the Pap smear in making the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and to examine the characteristics of Pap smear vs vaginal culture in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, with the vaginal Gram stain used as the diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective, blinded study involving 245 women who referred to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics in our hospital for routine genital examination between September 2001 and September 2002. Exclusion criteria included vaginal bleeding and pregnancy. Each patient had standard Pap smear, Gram-stained vaginal smear and culture of vaginal swab. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic value of Pap smear and vaginal culture results were determined with Gram stain used as the standard for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Using Gram stain diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as the standard, Pap smear and vaginal culture test results had sensitivity of 43.1 and 77.8%, specificity of 93.6 and 97.7%, positive predictive value of 73.8 and 93.3%, negative predictive value of 79.8 and 91.4%, diagnostic value of 78.8 and 91.8%, respectively, for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Compared to the microbiological test results, Pap smear is not sensitive enough for screening of bacterial vaginosis. However, because of its high specificity, it may be an adequate diagnostic criteria when it is positive.
TI  - Culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  - Renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. In this study, a culture-independent 16S rRNA-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. Similarly sized amplicons encompassing the V6 to V8 region of the 16S rRNA were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (WAVE System). Artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. We evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and DHPLC generated peak profiles. However, for culture-negative specimens, DHPLC facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. DNA sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. Thus, in PCR-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as Corynebacterium urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Dialister invisus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus iners, Leptotrichia amnionii, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella ruminicola, Rahnella aquatilis, and Streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. The method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both DHPLC-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. A detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginitis: general overview].
AB  - Bacteria are the most frequently detected agents in women, clinically complaining of vaginal discharge. The studies have shown that the vaginal microflora of women with bacterial vaginitis have altered from Lactobacillus spp. to various anaerobic bacteria. Gardnerella vaginalis is found in vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginitis as well as in healthy women, while anaerobic bacteria such as Mobiluncus and Prevotella are the causative agents for bacterial vaginosis. For the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginitis, direct microscopy is one of the most commonly used methods, and for this purpose cervicovaginal smears are examined by staining Papanicolaou and Gram stains. Because of the demonstration of bacterial vaginitis in association with the obstetric diseases such as preterm labor and postpartum endometritis, is a risk factor, its importance has increased recently. In this review article, the microorganisms that cause bacterial vaginitis, their biological characteristics, and the diagnostic laboratory methods of infection, have been discussed.
TI  - Effectiveness of current therapy of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The study was conducted in order to evaluate effectiveness of the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) with different therapeutic regimes according to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). During a one-year period (February 2000-February 2001) the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Center was visited by 482 women aged 14-51. The diagnosis of BV was established by standard methods: Amsel's clinical criteria and Gram stain of vaginal discharge. The first-line treatment was oral Metronidazole 2 g single dose. Second line was Metronidazole 500 mg twice daily orally for 7 days or oral Clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for seven days. BV was confirmed in 74 women (15.4%). Most often it was observed in women aged 17-30 years of age. Thirty-three (44.6% of total) were young women 14-21 years of age. Thirty-one (42%) women received a follow-up examination and of those, 11 (38.7%) needed a repeat treatment for BV due to unsatisfactory results of this treatment. It is concluded that treatment of BV with standard methods was not always effective with no significant difference between women under 21 years and older women found in regards to response to treatment. Besides antibiotic treatment, the so-called Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus) can be taken into consideration as an alternative treatment. Additional research about the therapeutic effect of this type of drugs is needed.
TI  - Detection of bacterial vaginosis-related organisms by real-time PCR for Lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of detecting bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related organisms in stored genital tract specimens using real-time PCR. Frozen cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from 21 women were analyzed by real-time PCR for the numbers of Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli. Lactobacilli organisms were detected in all CVL samples, G. vaginalis was detected in all but one sample, while M. hominis was detected in only six samples. Using the Amsel criteria to define BV, the samples from women with BV had significantly higher numbers of G. vaginalis organisms than samples from women without BV (P=0.004). In contrast, the number of lactobacilli organisms in BV samples was significantly lower (P=0.013). The number of M. hominis organisms was not significantly different between BV-positive and BV-negative samples. A striking relationship was observed where most of the samples contained high numbers of either lactobacilli or G. vaginalis but not both. These results show that it is possible to determine the presence of BV-related organisms in stored genital tract samples by PCR, suggesting that this could be developed into an objective method that could be useful for certain applications.
TI  - Characterization and selection of vaginal Lactobacillus strains for the preparation of vaginal tablets.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize and select Lactobacillus strains for properties that would  make them a good alternative to the use of antibiotics to treat human vaginal infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten Lactobacillus strains belonging to four different Lactobacillus species were analysed for properties relating to mucosal colonization or microbial antagonism (adhesion to human epithelial cells, hydrogen peroxide production, antimicrobial activity towards Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans and coaggregation with pathogens). The involvement of electrostatic interactions and the influence of bacterial metabolic state in the binding of lactobacilli to the cell surface were also studied. Adherence to epithelial cells varied greatly among the Lactobacillus species and among different strains belonging to the same Lactobacillus species. The reduction in surface negative electric charge promoted the binding of several Lactobacillus strains to the cell membrane whereas lyophilization reduced the adhesion capacity of many isolates. The antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli culture supernatant fluids was not directly related to the production of H2O2. CONCLUSIONS: Three strains (Lactobacillus brevis CD2, Lact. salivarius FV2 and Lact. gasseri MB335) showed optimal properties and were, therefore, selected for the preparation of vaginal tablets. The selected strains adhered to epithelial cells displacing vaginal pathogens; they produced high levels of H2O2, coaggregated with pathogens and inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The dosage formulation developed in this study appears to be a good candidate for the probiotic prophylaxis and treatment of human vaginal infections.
TI  - Douching in relation to bacterial vaginosis, lactobacilli, and facultative bacteria in the vagina.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study how frequency, recentness, and reason for douching impact bacterial vaginosis-related vaginal microflora and the occurrence of cervical pathogens. Douching has been linked to bacterial vaginosis as well as to chlamydial cervicitis in some, but not all, studies. METHODS: A total of 1200 women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were enrolled from five clinical sites around the United States. Cross-sectional, structured interviews were conducted and vaginal swabs were self-obtained for Gram stain, culture, and DNA amplification tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: Douching at least once per month was associated with an increased frequency of bacterial vaginosis. Those who douched recently (within 7 days) were at highest risk [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 3.1]. Douching for symptoms (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1, 2.6) and for hygiene (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0, 1.9) both related to bacterial vaginosis risk. The associations between douching and Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and lack of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli were similar to those between douching and bacterial vaginosis. Gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis was not associated with douching. CONCLUSION: Douching for symptoms or hygiene, particularly frequent or recent douching, was associated with bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated vaginal microflora, but not with gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis.
TI  - Improving Gram-stained reproducible result by further adding clue cells in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The reproducibility of interpretation in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis may be enhanced by adding pus cells and clue cells into two different criteria, developed by Spiegel et al. and Nugent et al. The purpose of study was designed to find out which parameter was more reproducible. 100 patients were collected with the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as an experimental group, while the other 100 patients who were with routine Papanicolaou smears in gynecologic clinic the collected as a control group. Two slides, including the original and reproducible ones, were obtained from vaginal smears for each patient. Three technicians read the slides randomly by using two different criteria, plus pus cells and clue cells. This showed the agreement for clue cells is the best method regardless of experimental group or control group (Kappa values between 0.708 and 1.000). The intra-observer agreement for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by the method of Nugent et al. is superior to the method of Spiegel et al. Our data show the comparison of Amsel criteria versus Nugent criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 55.4%, negative positive value of 62.1%, and positive predictive value of 85.8%. Moreover, our data also demonstrate the comparison of Amsel criteria versus the diagnosis either based on Nugent criteria or the presence of clue cells with sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 56.7%, negative positive value of 81.2%, and positive predictive value of 87.1%. The results demonstrate further adding score of the clue cells can enhance the reproducible diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which is superior to the methods of Nugent et al. and Spiegel et al.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be common among women who report having sex with women (WSW) and frequently occurs in both members of monogamous couples. The results of Gram staining of a vaginal smear were consistent with BV in 81 (25%) and intermediate in 37 (11%) of 326 WSW included in this study. Lactobacilli were detected in 64% of subjects, and 42% of subjects had H(2)O(2)-producing strains. BV was associated with a higher lifetime number of female sex partners, failure to always clean an insertive sex toy before use, and oral-anal sex with female partners. Neither recent douching nor sexual practices with male partners were associated with BV. Vaginal smears from each partner were concordant in 55 (95%) of 58 monogamous couples; BV was present in both partners in 16 couples (28%) (P<.001, compared with expected distribution). BV was common among subjects who did not douche, who did not have concurrent sex with male partners, or who did not have a new sex partner, which suggests that other risk factors for BV exist. These data support the hypothesis that sexual exchange of vaginal secretions is a possible mechanism for acquisition of BV.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Vaginal microflora in healthy women with Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - In order to find the vaginal prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in a normal female population, we determined the incidence of G. vaginalis in relation to that of other bacterial genera and species in the vagina. Two-hundred and thirty-nine healthy women were the subjects of this study. Vaginal discharge was collected and bacteriological studies were performed. The mean total aerobe count in the G. vaginalis-positive group was 9.02 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/g, which was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than that (6.80 log10 CFU/g) in the G. vaginalis-negative group. In contrast, there was no difference in the mean total anaerobe count between the two groups of subjects (8.82 and 8.24 log10 CFU/g, respectively in the case of including Lactobacillus species count). Also, the mean pH level of vaginal secretion in the G. vaginalis-positive group was 4.58, which was significantly higher (P < 0.005) than that (4.10) in the G. vaginalis-negative group. Aerobes were isolated at equal incidence in the two groups. Anaerobes were isolated at a significantly higher rate in the G. vaginalis-positive group (P < 0.005) than in the G. vaginalis-negative group. The mean count of Lactobacillus species was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the G. vaginalis-negative group than in the positive counterpart (7.02 vs 8.66). Elevation of vaginal pH, an increase in the anaerobe count, and decreases in the Lactobacillus species count could be good predictors of the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in healthy women.
TI  - Bacteriocin susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and metronidazole susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the bacteriocin susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole. STUDY DESIGN: Bacteriocin susceptibility of 36 G vaginalis clinical isolates was tested against a vaginal strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus by a growth-inhibition method. The relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole were analyzed by the chi2 test and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Eight G vaginalis strains (22%) were bacteriocin-resistant. Biotypes 5 and 7 were found to be the most frequent among these resistant strains. Eight (42%) of the 19 isolates classified as biotype 5, 6, or 7 were bacteriocin-resistant compared with none of the isolates that were classified as other biotypes (P <.01). Biotype 5 was found in higher prevalence among the isolates resistant to bacteriocin (62%) than among the susceptible isolates (14%) (P =.01). Genotype B was found more frequently among the bacteriocin-resistant strains, but this finding was not statistically significant (P =.71). Seven (88%) bacteriocin-resistant strains were also resistant to metronidazole. CONCLUSION: An association between biotype and an increased resistance to bacteriocin was found. The ability of G vaginalis to resist the antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus bacteriocin may be a pivotal factor in understanding bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Defense factors of vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antagonistic relationship between vaginal lactobacilli and endogenous vaginal microflora. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-two Lactobacillus strains were studied for the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocin. RESULTS: Under standardized growth conditions, most strains increased their biomass by more than 4 times. Lactobacillus species grew best at a pH > or = 4.5, and growth was retarded at a pH < 4.5. Lactic acid levels were 0.68 to 2.518 mg/mL and were not related to the number of cells or the pH of media. The pH of the media was caused by the secretion of lactic and other organic acids. Approximately 80% of the strains produced H(2)O(2) and were graded as 2+ in one third of the strains and 1+ in others. No statistical correlation was found between H(2)O(2) lactic acid and bacteriocin production. Bacteriocin activity was tested on 4 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Approximately 80% of the lactobacilli tested produced bacteriocin that inhibited growth of G vaginalis. Six of the strains did not produce bacteriocin. Thirteen strains produced all 3 defense factors, whereas the others lacked 1 or 2 properties. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus species grow best at a pH > 4.5. The pH of the media is dependent on the cell mass and on all organic acids produced by Lactobacillus species. Although all species produce organic acids, not all produce H(2)O(2) and bacteriocin. Not all strains of G vaginalis can be inhibited by lactobacilli-producing bacteriocin.
TI  - Nugent score related to vaginal culture in pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To relate Gram-stained smears, using the Nugent criteria, to quantitative and qualitative vaginal cultures in pregnant women. METHODS: Two independent evaluators using the Nugent criteria, a standardized method of Gram-stain interpretation designed to detect bacterial vaginosis, scored 104 vaginal smears from pregnant women. The quantitative and qualitative vaginal cultures were assessed at the same time and the results expressed as log(10) colony-forming units per gram of vaginal secretion. The Nugent scores were compared with the microbiologic findings. RESULTS: The prevalence of normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis vaginal flora as determined by Gram stain was 68%, 21%, and 11%, respectively. A comparison of the mean bacterial counts with the Nugent score showed a weak negative correlation for Lactobacillus species and a positive correlation for gram-variable and gram-negative rods. Additional analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the mean bacterial counts analyses of Peptostreptococcus, a genus not included in the Nugent scoring system, and the Nugent score. In addition, the Prevotella counts correlated strongly with both the Nugent score and the Peptostreptococcus counts. The quantitative counts for Lactobacillus did not vary significantly among the three defined groups of vaginal microflora; however, significant increases in the concentrations of Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella were found as the Nugent score increased. CONCLUSION: A strong correlation was found among the gram-variable and gram-negative genera comprised by the Nugent score. Peptostreptococcus also correlated strongly with the Nugent score and with the Prevotella counts, suggesting that this genus may play a role in determining vaginal health.
TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 stimulatory activity by Gardnerella vaginalis: relationship to biotypes and other pathogenic characteristics.
AB  - Stimulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 expression by Gardnerella vaginalis is one possible cause for an increase in the amount of virus in the genital tract. The ability of G. vaginalis to induce HIV expression in chronically infected U1 cells was investigated, along with its possible relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole and bacteriocin. Significant HIV stimulatory activity was found in 5 (50%) lysates of G. vaginalis. The ability to induce HIV expression in U1 cells was statistically associated with G. vaginalis biotype (P=.048) but not with genotype or resistance to metronidazole and bacteriocin. Further studies to explore the in vivo relevance of HIV activation by G. vaginalis in the female genital tract are warranted, since prevention strategies of bacterial vaginosis and colonization by certain biotypes of G. vaginalis may be valuable in reducing the risk of sexual transmission of HIV.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis among a group of married Jordanian women: occurrence and laboratory diagnosis.
AB  - A total of 310 vaginal swabs collected from a group of married Jordanian women complaining of vaginal discharge were examined for bacterial vaginosis. The scoring system of Nugent for the interpretation of Gram staining was employed. This system revealed the presence of the condition in 29.7% of patients. Results obtained using the scoring system correlated significantly with the detection of clue cells and the scarcity of white blood cells in the vaginal discharge. An inverse relationship was found between bacterial vaginosis and Lactobacillus morphotypes determined by Gram staining. No definite relationship was detected between bacterial vaginosis and the recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis by culture as this organism was isolated from swabs which according to the Nugent criterion were negative for bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis among the women investigated was more prevalent than vaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis or yeasts.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein produced by vaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus that inhibits Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate bacteriocin from a vaginal strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus. METHODS: L. acidophilus 160 was grown on two media. The first was MRS broth for 18 hours; the cells were harvested, washed, and placed into a chemically defined medium. The second medium resembled vaginal fluid minus protein. Bacteriocin was precipitated from both media using ammonium sulfate. The growth-inhibiting activity of bacteriocin was determined by a bioassay using nine different isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. RESULTS: MRS broth is not a suitable medium for extracting bacteriocin, because it binds with Tween 80. Bacteriocin was isolated, without contaminating constituents, from chemically defined medium and identified as a single band by electrophoresis. Bacteriocin has a molecular weight of 3.8 kDa. All nine isolates of Gardnerella were inhibited by the bacteriocin isolated from L. acidophilus 160. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus 160 was isolated from the chemically defined medium (starvation medium) in a partially pure form. L. acidophilus 160 bacteriocin inhibited growth of all nine isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis.
TI  - The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and vaginal flora changes.
AB  - In a population of 956 women, attending for contraceptive advice, 131 (13.7%) were found to have BV acording to Amsel's criteria. Clue cells were detected in 200 (20.9%) women, a positive amine ('sniff') test in 191 (20.0%), a vaginal pH > or = 4.7 in 243 (25.4%) and a "characteristic" vaginal discharge in 104 (10.9%) women. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in relation to BV were calculated for each of these four criteria. The detection of clue cells, an increased pH and a positive sniff test showed excellent sensitivity (86-100%) values, but had a less satisfactory positive predictive value (52-68%). Vaginal discharge was found to be a poor predictor of BV. The vaginal flora in women with clue cells, increased vaginal pH or a positive sniff test was very similar to that of the women with BV, every after excluding concomitant cases of BV and the three respective criteria. Thus, a positive amine test, which is easily performed, strongly suggests BV and a vaginal flora predominated by Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus species and anaerobic species on one hand, and lack of lactobacilli on the other. When there is a clinical suspicion of BV, the sniff test is positive and differential diagnoses are excluded, one can safely treat a woman for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Clarithromycin-induced alterations in vaginal flora.
AB  - Many antibiotics have been shown to alter both the bacterial and the fungal flora of the vagina, in some cases potentially increasing a woman's propensity toward urinary tract infections and vaginal candidiasis. The effects of some of the newer macrolide antibiotics on women's vaginal flora have not been previously studied, and almost none of the previous studies specifically cultured for effects on vaginal lactobacillus. Young women (ages 18-45 years) who were about to go onto therapy with clarithromycin, who did not have any conditions known to affect the vaginal flora (eg, diabetes mellitus, spermicide use, menopausal status without hormone replacement therapy), and who agreed to participate in the study were cultured with aerobic and anaerobic and fungal vaginal cultures before starting the antibiotic. These same women were then retested about 4 to 6 weeks after the start of their antibiotic course, and the results of their preantibiotic and postantibiotic cultures were compared. Lactobacillus was present in 33% of patients by vaginal culture before treatment, but this decreased to 0% after treatment. Escherichia coli was present in only 8% of patients before treatment, but this increased to 17% of patients after treatment. Enterococcus was present in 25% of patients before treatment but in only 8% of patients after treatment. The incidence of Gardnerella vaginalis was not affected by the treatment. Candida species incidence increased from 17% to 33% with treatment. The overall effects of clarithromycin on the vaginal flora are similar to other older antibiotics that have been tested.
TI  - Predictors of the vaginal microflora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to define influences on the patterns of the vaginal microflora. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 617 African American and Mexican American women in a 1-year longitudinal study of sexual behaviors and the vaginal microflora on the basis of the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, or syphilis at the initial visit. The patients were assigned randomly to a behavioral intervention or standard counseling regarding sexually transmitted disease. We reevaluated 508 (82%) and 549 (89%) women at 6 and 12 months, respectively. A comprehensive survey of lower genital tract organisms was conducted at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Behavioral and microbiologic associations were screened by bivariate analysis. All variables associated with an organism at P < or = .15 were included in a multivariate analysis. Associations between behavior and the genital tract microflora were identified by logistic regression coefficients with P <.05. RESULTS: African American race had a consistent association with vaginal microflora, specifically, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Various behaviors had a less consistent effect, including multiple partners, douching, frequency of coitus >3 times a week, and cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse at the last sexual encounter. M hominis (but not Ureaplasma urealyticum ), Gardnerella vaginalis, and Lactobacillus species were associated with bacterial vaginosis. Lactobacillus species appeared to protect against bacterial vaginosis and infection with G vaginalis. Sexually transmitted diseases (caused by M hominis, N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and T vaginalis ) were associated with each other. In contrast, hormonal status, vaginal blood, and foreign bodies had little effect. CONCLUSION: The presence of other microorganisms and race have a more consistent association with the presence or absence of a cervical-vaginal organism than sexual behavior, hormonal status, vaginal devices, or the presence of abnormal vaginal bleeding.
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - Inhibition of chemotaxis by organic acids from anaerobes may prevent a purulent response in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - It has been postulated that certain organic acids produced by the anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) could prevent a purulent response in this infection. Varying concentrations of pure succinic, acetic and lactic acids were incubated in vitro with a monocytic cell line (MonoMac 6). High inhibition of chemotaxis was produced by succinic acid; lower inhibition and no inhibition was shown by acetic acid and lactic acid respectively. Succinic and acetic acids were detected in high concentrations in the vaginal fluid of women with BV and in culture supernates of Prevotella and Mobiluncus spp.; these acids impaired chemotaxis of MonoMac 6 cells in vitro. The vaginal fluids of normal women and the culture supernates of Lactobacillus spp. had no effect on chemotaxis.
TI  - Conservation in probiotic preparations of Lactobacillus with inhibitory capacity  on other species.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus isolated from dairy products and genital tract competed  with Candida albicans through a membrane of 12000 dalton cut-off. This inhibition was due to hydrogen peroxide and was trypsin-stable, heat-sensitive and antagonized by catalase. Lactobacillus coming from "starters" showed antimicrobial activity against fungus isolated in a yogurt factory. Penicillium, Alternaria, Phialophora, Microsporum and Candida spp. were inhibited when 10(2) spores were inoculated in the assay. No inhibition was observed with 10(5) spores. Besides, one of 21 Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women inhibited pathogenic bacteria by means a bacteriocin trypsin-sensitive, heat-stable and retained by dialysis membrane. Tablets for future probiotic use were prepared and the viability of bacteria was assayed using media with different compositions. Pharmaceutical preparations with polyethyleneglycol was the best formulation for the Lactobacillus viability, the counts remained between 10(7) and 10(6) cfu/tablet for up to 1 year.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was first reported in 1995 by Gardner and Dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. They also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "Haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. BV has a complex microbiology. Lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes G. vaginalis, anaerobic Gram-negative rods such as Prevotella species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. Those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome, raising the vaginal pH and producing a discharge odor. The excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". Nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. Results from epidemiologic studies have associated BV with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. In particular, the presence of BV in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that BV is a cause of preterm delivery. The interest in potential invasiveness of G. vaginalis has increased. However, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. The most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Characterisation and selection of a Lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of Lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. BV has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. A total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. The characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent BV, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). Four strains of lactobacilli, L. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), L. crispatus (55730) and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest inhibitory activity against the BV-associated bacterial species. Two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced H2O2. All four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (pH <4). Only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to VEC (>100 bacteria/VEC). A further isolate (L. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against BV-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of H2O2 and was also highly adherent to VEC. Isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.
TI  - Pathogenesis of abnormal vaginal bacterial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the relationships between microscopy findings on wet mounts, such as lactobacillary grade or vaginal leukocytosis, and results of vaginal culture, lactate and succinate content of the vagina, and levels of selected cytokines. STUDY DESIGN: In a population of 631 unselected women seeking treatment at an obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic, vaginal fluid was obtained by wooden Ayre spatula for wet mounting and pH measurement, by high vaginal swab for culture, and by standardized vaginal rinsing with 2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution for measurements of lactate, succinate, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 8, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations. Lactate and succinate levels were measured by gas-liquid chromatography and the cytokine concentrations were measured by specific immunoassays. Both univariate analysis (Student t test, Welch test, chi(2) test, and Fisher exact test) and multivariate regression analysis (Cox analysis) were used. RESULTS: Increasing disturbance of the lactobacillary flora (lactobacillary grades I, IIa, IIb, and III) was highly correlated with the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, enterococci, group B streptococci, and Escherichia coli. Vaginal pH and interleukin 8 and interleukin 1beta concentrations increased linearly with increasing lactobacillary grade, whereas lactate concentrations and the presence of epithelial cell lysis decreased. A similar pattern of associations with increasing leukocyte count was clear, but in addition there was an increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. Multivariate analysis of vaginal leukocytosis, lactobacillary grades, and the presence of positive vaginal culture results showed that interleukin 1beta concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade, leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade and positive culture results, interleukin 8 concentration was most closely related to positive culture results, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentration was most closely related to vaginal leukocytosis and positive culture results. The concentration ratio of interleukin 1beta to interleukin 1 receptor antagonist remained stable, except when vaginal leukocytosis increased. In its most severe form, with >10 leukocytes per epithelial cell present, a decompensation of the vaginal flora with a collapse in interleukin 1beta and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations was seen, but there was a concurrent sharp increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. This pattern was completely different from the course of the cytokine concentrations associated with a lactobacillary grade increase. CONCLUSION: Both disturbed lactobacillary grade and the presence of increasing vaginal leukocytosis were correlated with lactobacillary substrate (lactate) concentration, pH, and the concentrations of a variety of cytokines. There was a remarkably linear increase in these cytokines as either leukocytosis or lactobacillary grade became more severe. In circumstances in which leukocytosis was extreme, however, interleukin 1beta was no longer produced but leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations increased. We speculate that in extreme inflammation the body tries to limit the damage that can be done by exaggerated cytokine production.
TI  - Acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  - Perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. During these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (pH approximately 4). This study was designed to test whether the characteristics of acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. Eight vaginal Lactobacillus isolates from four species-L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. crispatus, and L. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the Lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (pH 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (B. Andersch, L. Forssman, K. Lincoln, and P. Torstensson, Gynecol. Obstet. Investig. 21:19-25, 1986; L. Cohen, Br. J. Vener. Dis. 45:241-246, 1969; J. Paavonen, Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; C. Tevi-Benissan, L. Belec, M. Levy, V. Schneider-Fauveau, A. Si Mohamed, M.-C. Hallouin, M. Matta, and G. Gresenguet, Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). During exponential growth, all of these Lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. Such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (W. H. Masters and V. E. Johnson, Human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). During bacterial vaginosis (BV), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal pH rises to >4.5. This correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. Three BV-associated bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal pH associated with BV. Together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.
TI  - The effects of three nonoxynol-9 preparations on vaginal flora and epithelium.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of nonoxynol-9 (N-9) on the vaginal flora and epithelium, 48 women (16 in each group) were evaluated by use of quantitative vaginal cultures and colposcopy. at baseline and at 0.5, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after insertion of one of three N-9 preparations (4% gel [Conceptrol], 3.5% gel [Advantage-24], or a 28% vaginal contraceptive film). The proportion positive for H2O2+ or H2O2- lactobacilli did not change significantly with any of the preparations, but lactobacilli concentrations decreased transiently. Both the proportion of women with Gardnerella vaginalis and the concentration of G. vaginalis decreased transiently. The proportion of women with Escherichia coli increased with the 4% gel, and the concentration increased with all preparations. The number with anaerobic gram-negative rods increased, although the concentrations decreased. Symptoms and colposcopic abnormalities were rare. Changes in levels of vaginal bacteria were transient after single applications of N-9, but adverse effects may be enhanced with frequent, chronic use.
TI  - The growth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus in Sorbarod biofilms.
AB  - Sorbarod biofilms were investigated for their suitability in establishing continuous culture biofilms for the study of bacterial vaginosis. Two important organisms in the condition, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, were studied. In contrast to growth in broth culture, both organisms were maintained for at least 96 h in a steady state on the biofilms. With G. vaginalis, the haemolytic activity was consistently maintained in the biofilms in contrast to short-term activity in broth culture which matched the bacterial titre. The simple Sorbarod system appears to be suitable for studying the growth conditions of bacteria in continuous culture and has potential for investigating interactions between micro-organisms.
TI  - [Estimation of cytological smears in women with Gardnerella vaginalis infections  of vagina and uterine cervix].
AB  - Among micro-organisms infecting vagina whose dominant genus is Gardnerella vaginalis anaerobic bacteria are often present. Well-known damaging tissues and cells features of anaerobic bacteria are taken under consideration as factors which are conductive to generating pathological changes in cervical epithelium. The aim of this study was evaluation of cytological smears (Pap smear, Gram stain and H + E stain) in women with Gardnerella vaginalis infections of vagina and uterine cervix. The research was carried out on 1180 women hospitalised in the prior of fourteen months in Obstetrics-Gynaecological Department of the Municipal Hospital in Kielce. It was proved that characteristic microscopic feature of vagina and uterine cervix Gardnerella vaginalis infection is the absence of lactic acid bacillus, Lactobacillus vaginalis in vaginal contents and a presence of a small number of polynuclear neutrophil leucocytes. Marker cells (clue cells) are easily recognised in microscopic image in vaginal smears stained by Gram's method as well as Papanicolaou method. High sensitivity and specificity of these markers suggest usefulness of cytological smears in diagnosing Gardnerella vaginalis infections.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: association with adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract infection encountered  among women of reproductive age. This condition can best be considered as a vaginal syndrome associated with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora rather than an infection specific to any one microorganism. Bacterial vaginosis is a clinical condition with a complex microbiology that is characterized by a reduced concentration of a normally abundant Lactobacillus species along with high concentrations of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, particularly, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Mycoplasma species. The exact make up of the microorganisms and their relative concentration vary among women who have this condition. Although it was previously regarded as a harmless condition, recent work has linked bacterial vaginosis to numerous upper genital tract complications such as preterm labor and preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis. The findings from recent prospective randomized trials suggest that treatment of bacterial vaginosis in certain women who are at high risk for preterm delivery decreases the rate of preterm birth.
TI  - Use of a continuous-culture biofilm system to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus have been shown to grow to high titers in a simple biofilm system. This system was used in the present investigation to compare the biofilm-eradicating concentrations (BECs) of amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole to standard tube MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) results. With the lactobacillus, the BEC/tube MBC ratio was at least 16:1, while for G. vaginalis the ratio varied from 2:1 to 512:1. The simple continuous-culture system used in the present investigation is ideal for investigating the BEC for bacteria involved in complex ecological situations such as bacterial vaginosis and may be useful for the identification of the most effective and selective antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Few microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis may constitute the pathologic core: a population-based microbiologic study among 3596 pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between various microorganisms isolated from the genital tract in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional population-based study among pregnant women addressed at their first antenatal visit before 24 full gestational weeks from the referring area of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, from November 1992 to February 1994. The main outcome measures were prevalence of various microorganisms and statistical estimates of interactions (crude, adjusted, and relative odds ratios) between the microorganisms isolated from the lower genital tract in pregnant women with and without clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. RESULTS: Three thousand five hundred ninety-six (3596) pregnant women were asked to participate. Of the 3596 pregnant women 3174 (88.4%) agreed to participate before 24 full gestational weeks. After controlling for the presence of other microorganisms, strong associations between Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma hominis, and present bacterial vaginosis were found. Similarly Lactobacillus spp. were found to be associated with the absence of bacterial vaginosis. The combination of G. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria and/or M. hominis was found in 59.6% of the cases with bacterial vaginosis and in 3.9% of the cases without bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio 36.4, 95% confidence interval 27.8 to 47.8). The crude odds ratio was found to be as high as 74.8 (95% confidence interval 32.3 to 174.1) when the combination of G. vaginalis, M. hominis, anaerobic bacteria, and no Lactobacillus spp. was associated with bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSION: There is a microbial foundation for bacterial vaginosis, and it is possibly due to an intermicrobial interaction in which the microorganisms G. vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and M. hominis are dominating, indicating that these constitute the pathologic core of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Interrelationships within the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  - Analysis of 240 consecutive vaginal swabs using the compatibility profile technique revealed that only 2 bacteria have the ability to be a sole isolate and as such a candidate to be a major aerobic regulator of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract (BFFGT). Compatibility profiles of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis have shown that these organisms shared compatibility profiling for the majority of the normal bacterial constituents of the female genital tract. Dominance disruption appears to come from the addition of compatible co-isolates and presumed loss of numerical superiority. These phenomena appear to be the keys to reregulation of BFFGT. Lactobacillus appears to be the major regulator of both G. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria. When additional organisms are added to the bacterial flora, they may add to or partially negate the inhibitory influence of Lactobacillus on the BFFGT. Inhibitor interrelationships appear to exist between coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus and the group B streptococci (GBS) and other beta hemolytic streptococci. Facilitating interrelationships appear to exist between S. aureus and the GBS and selected Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in Japanese and Thai pregnant women.
AB  - The vaginal flora of 118 Japanese and 208 Thai pregnant women were investigated for the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), BV-associated organisms, and BV-associated enzyme. A similar prevalence of BV was found among the Japanese (13.6%) and Thai women (15.9%). The microbial flora of women with BV were complex; the mean number of isolates recovered in the BV group was approximately 2 times more than that in a group of healthy women. Prevotella species, Porphyromonas species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mobiluncus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, and H2O2-nonproducing lactobacilli were significantly associated with BV. These organisms were less associated with H2O2-producing lactobacilli, which were predominant in women with normal flora, suggesting that H2O2-producing lactobacilli have antibacterial activity against BV-associated organisms. The vaginal sialidase assay by means of a filter-paper spot test was not proved to be a useful screening aid for diagnosis of BV because of the low sensitivity (69.4%) of this test.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: prevalence in an Italian population of asymptomatic pregnant women and diagnostic aspects.
AB  - The present study has been carried out with the main objective of determining the prevalence rate of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a population of asymptomatic pregnant women (8th to 9th month of pregnancy). Out of a total 1,441 patients examined BV was found to be present in 70 (4.9%). The diagnosis was made when an analysis of the vaginal discharge revealed the simultaneous presence of at least three out of four of the following laboratory indices: (1) direct Gram stain positive (bacterial flora mixed with Gram-negative coccobacilli and variable-gram predominant over the lactobacillus flora); (2) pH > 4.5; (3) positive odour test with KOH 10%; (4) presence of clue cells. After a discussion of the principal laboratory and clinical signs presently used for the diagnosis of BV, the authors suggest the exclusion of the evaluation of the appearance of the vaginal discharge from the standard diagnostic criteria. Further, three diagnostic methods are hypothesized for use in different settings.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: distribution of bacterial species in different  gram-stain categories of the vaginal flora.
AB  - Vaginal swabs for microbiological culture were taken from 174 pregnant women whose vaginal flora had been evaluated by Gram's stain; 50 had grade III flora (bacterial vaginosis, BV), 50 grade II (intermediate), 41 had vaginal flora graded as abnormal which then reverted to grade I (revertants) and 33 had normal flora (controls). The aim was to determine whether bacterial species isolated from women with grade II flora differed from those with grade III flora. Isolation of Lactobacillus spp. decreased from grade I to grade III and that of other aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species increased. There was little difference in the species isolated from women with grade II and grade III flora, but there was a distinct order in which organisms in different species increased in numbers. The vaginal flora of revertants was intermediate between that of healthy controls and those with grade II flora. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from a greater number of revertants than grade I controls but the incidence did not increase in grade II or grade III. Bifidobacterium spp. were isolated from a greater number of revertants than grade I controls and increased further in grade II and grade III. However, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were isolated from a much larger number of women with grade III flora than the other groups. The conclusion is that grade II is a transitional phase between grade I and grade III and that some organisms such as G. vaginalis and M. hominis only reach large numbers in the late stage. The sequence of appearance of the various bacterial species may be a result of the pathophysiological alteration of the vaginal ecosystem associated with BV.
TI  - [Detection of bacterial vaginosis in gram stained vaginal smears and papanicolaou stained cervical smears].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) by papanicolaou (PAP)-stained cervical smears and gram-stained vaginal smears according to clinical criteria. METHODS: In the prospective study of 196 non-pregnant women of child-bearing age, 94 were clinically diagnosed to have BV. Gram-stained vaginal smears and PAP-stained cervical smears were collected from all enrolled patients. RESULTS: In comparison with clinical diagnosis of BV, the sensitivity and specificity of gram-stained vaginal smears and PAP-stained cervical smears were 94.7% (89/94), 98.0% (100/102) 85.1% (80/94), and 95.1% (97/102). The characteristics of BV in gram-stained vaginal smears and PAP-stained cervical smears included small bacteria of Gardnerella and bacteroides morphotypes and curved gram variable rods and absence of bacteria of Lactobacillus morphotypes. CONCLUSION: It is possible to screen and manage BV according to Gram-stained vaginal smears or PAP-stained cervical smears.
TI  - Composition of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  - One hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Candida albicans. Mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. Although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the L. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. Isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the L. acidophilus complex. Data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (P-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the L. acidophilus complex. DNA-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. Most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to L. gasseri CIP 102991T by the technique of DNA/DNA hybridization.
TI  - Growth inhibition of metronidazole-susceptible and metronidazole-resistant strains of Gardnerella vaginalis by Lactobacilli in vitro.
AB  - Metronidazole resistance was produced in susceptible Gardnerella vaginalis after  subculture in the presence of metronidazole. Metronidazole-resistant gardnerellae were less susceptible to growth inhibition by Lactobacillus culture filtrates. A low pH (+/- 4) and lactic acid accounted for 60 to 95% of inhibitory activity, and H2O2 accounted for only 0 to 30%. However, in the presence of myeloperoxidase, H2O2-producing lactobacilli decreased the viability of metronidazole-susceptible gardnerellae 2,000-fold.
TI  - Office laboratory diagnosis of vaginitis. Clinician-performed tests compared with a rapid nucleic acid hybridization test.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The traditional diagnosis of vaginitis incorporates patient symptoms, clinical findings observed during vaginal examination, and laboratory analysis of vaginal fluid. The purpose of this study was to evaluate routine clinician-performed office laboratory diagnostic techniques for women with abnormal vaginal symptoms, and to compare these results with those obtained by a DNA hybridization test for Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida species. METHODS: The study included 501 symptomatic women who were between the ages of 14 and 67 years. Three vaginal specimens were obtained for saline wet mount, potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep, amine "sniff", pH, and nucleic acid hybridization (T vaginalis, G vaginalis, and Candida sp) tests. Clinicians and medical technicians independently evaluated the wet mount, KOH prep, amine, and pH tests. A medical technician processed the DNA tests according to manufacturer's protocol. RESULTS: Of 499 subjects for whom complete data were available, vulvovaginal candidiasis was diagnosed in 20.0%, vaginal trichomoniasis in 7.4%, and bacterial vaginosis in 52.1%. Fourteen percent of subjects had multiple vaginal infections. The sensitivity and specificity of clinician microscopically diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis were 39.6% and 90.4%, 75.0% and 96.6%, and 76.5% and 70.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the DNA probe diagnosis of the same types of vaginitis were 75.0% and 95.7%, 86.5% and 98.5%, and 95.4% and 60.7%, respectively. When only women with multiple vaginal infections were considered, the percentages of correct clinician diagnoses for vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis were 49.3%, 83.6%, and 59.7%, respectively. For the DNA probe test, the percentages of correct diagnoses were 72.9%, 92.9%, and 90.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care clinicians demonstrated a high specificity but low sensitivity when identifying vaginal trichomoniasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis by microscopic techniques. Correct microscopic diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was even more difficult for clinicians, as was the diagnosis of multiple vaginal infections. Clinicians were not as accurate as the DNA probe test in diagnosing vaginal infections. Clinicians need more education in the laboratory diagnosis of vaginitis. Clinicians should carefully scrutinize each microscopic slide, systematically examine the slide for each type of vaginitis, and consider specimen pH and the presence of leukocytes, Lactobacillus organisms, or amine odor as additional clues to infection.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: drugs versus alternative treatment.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most common infectious disorders affecting women. It is caused by several microorganisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, beta-streptococci and mobiluncus/falcivibrio sp. Bacterial vaginosis is thought to occur as a result of a change in vaginal pH mediated by the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. This rise in vaginal pH interferes with the activity of vaginal lactobacilli which maintain vaginal acidity. Several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. Although metronidazole was found to be the most effective, none was completely successful in either cure or prevention. Several attempts have recently been made to treat bacterial vaginosis using physiological or 'natural' substances, such as lactate gel and commercial yoghurt, which is acidic and also contains lactobacillus strains. This kind of treatment looks promising and may have a place in certain clinical conditions, including pregnancy, in cases of recurrent inflammation, or as a prophylactic treatment before invasive gynecological procedures or abdominal surgery in patients known to be affected. This issue should be additionally studied and evaluated in light of the relatively little experience with this modality of treatment for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - A longitudinal study of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the longitudinal changes in the incidence of vaginosis in pregnancy. DESIGN: A prospective study of women during pregnancy. SETTING: A District General Hospital in North-West London. SUBJECTS: Seven hundred and eighteen pregnant women attending antenatal clinics. At their first attendance and subsequently, Gram-stained vaginal smears were examined and Mycoplasma hominis and Gardnerella vaginalis were sought by culture. RESULTS: Initially, 87 (12%) women had bacterial vaginosis diagnosed on Gram-stained reading of the vaginal smears. Examination of further smears, obtained from 176 women at 36 weeks of gestation, showed that those whose vaginal flora was normal initially, and who went to term, rarely developed vaginosis (three of 127, 2.4%). Samples were obtained at 36 weeks gestation from 32 women who had bacterial vaginosis initially, and went to term. In almost 50% (15 of 32) of these a normal lactobacillus-dominated flora had regenerated. Thirty-five women (5%) had initial vaginal smears graded as intermediate. From this group, six of the 17 (35%) women from whom samples were obtained at 36 weeks gestation still had flora of an intermediate pattern; 10(59%) now had normal flora and only one (6%) had developed bacterial vaginosis. Women with bacterial vaginosis were more likely to be culture-positive for M. hominis than those with normal flora (34/78 versus 10/563, odds ratio 42.73 (18.9 to 102.3) P < 0.001), or to be culture-positive for G. vaginalis than those with normal flora (35/78 versus 21/563, odds ratio 21.0 (10.75 to 41.2) P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women do not commonly develop bacterial vaginosis after 16 weeks gestation, and if present, it remits spontaneously in approximately half of those who reach term. As bacterial vaginosis is associated with increased rates of second trimester miscarriage and preterm delivery, any treatment aimed at its eradication in pregnancy should be given no later than the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy.
TI  - Studies on the anaerobic (bacterial) vaginosis among the Bangladeshi women of reproductive age group.
AB  - Vaginal swab from 190 patients aged between 15 to 45 years with the complaint of  excessive and foul smelling vaginal discharge and 50 healthy controls of comparable age were studied. Different diagnostic techniques used for the detection of G.vaginalis were compared. Antibiogram of isolated G.vaginalis was also performed to determine the drug sensitivity pattern. G. vaginalis were isolated from 74 patients (38.9%) and from 6 controls (12%). The rate of isolation of G. vaginalis in the vaginal swabs of patients is significantly higher (p < 0.001) as compared to controls. Vaginal flora in 91% of G. vaginalis positive patients were Gardnerella morphotype and clue cells were found in vaginal discharge in 85% of these cases. In contrast, vaginal flora of 92% control group were Lactobacilli morphotype N and no clue cell was detected. No pus cell was observed in the vaginal discharge of 66 (89.2%) of 74 patients infected with G. vaginalis. Amine test was positive in 81% G. vaginalis positive patients. The test was negative in all the control cases. Significance of these findings were discussed in detail.
TI  - Evaluation of the Etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  - One hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 Gardnerella vaginalis, 16 Mobiluncus spp., 19 Peptostreptococcus spp., 20 Lactobacillus spp., 20 Prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 Bacteroides fragilis group, 12 Clostridium spp., and five Fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and a reference (Brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. For the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the Etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of Mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for Peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). The quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. Results with B. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. The absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between Etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. The Etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.
TI  - Effects of Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A decreased concentration or total disappearance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. GOAL OF THE STUDY: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial strains 14C- and or 3H-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in VECs before and after treatment at sub-MIC with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. RESULTS: In control tests of adherence, G. vaginalis and M. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at pH 5.4, L. acidophilus at pH 4.4. Preincubation of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/mL (subinhibitory concentration) at pH 5.4 reduced adherence to VECs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. The same treatment of L. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. Treatment of VECs alone did not modify adherence. Competition tests between L. acidophilus and G. vaginalis and between L. acidophilus and M. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, L. acidophilus could compete with G. vaginalis and M. curtisii for binding sites in VECs at pH 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. At a higher pH (4.8 and 5.4), L. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii. CONCLUSIONS: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii to VECs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. Adhesion of L. acidophilus to VECs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at pH 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. At higher pH levels, L. acidophilus did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii.
TI  - Variability of polymerase chain reaction-based detection of human papillomavirus  DNA is associated with the composition of vaginal microbial flora.
AB  - The results of repeated human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing were compared to changes in cervical pathology and the composition of vaginal microorganisms. A cohort of 19 women with HPV cervical infections in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at enrollment was reexamined on average at 7.3-month intervals over a 2-year period. At each follow-up visit, cytological and colposcopic examinations were done and vaginal microorganisms were assessed quantitatively by Gram staining of secretions, and anaerobic and aerobic culture. HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis using DNA isolated from exfoliated cervical cells. The detection of HPV DNA was significantly associated with carriage of Grade II flora (P < 0.001), isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis (P = 0.03), Ureaplasma urealyticum (P = 0.04), Candida albicans (P = 0.01), Bacteroides species (P = 0.01), and overgrowth by anaerobes (P = 0.004). Normal vaginal flora, characterised by the predominance of Lactobacillus species, was significantly associated (P < 0.001) with a negative HPV test. The detection of HPV DNA is associated with the composition of microorganisms present in the vagina at the time of testing.
TI  - Microbiological patterns in vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and microbial aetiology of vaginitis, and  the usefulness of Gram staining of vaginal fluid in detecting the aetiology of vaginitis in Sri Lankan women. DESIGN: Prospective study with microbiological investigation of high vaginal specimens from symptomatic and healthy groups of women. SETTING: A gynaecological clinic of the De Soysa Hospital for Women, and a family planning clinic of the Family Health Bureau, Colombo. PATIENTS: 114 untreated patients with symptoms suggestive of vaginitis and 109 healthy controls. RESULTS: Candida species were isolated from 36% patients and 9% of controls. Gardnerella vaginalis was recovered from 8.8% of patients and 7.3% of controls. The bacterial vaginitis group consisted of several distinct subgroups, viz Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis, anaerobic vaginitis, non-anaerobic vaginitis and polymicrobial vaginitis. The incidence of trichomoniasis was lower (4.4%) compared to other studies. Other bacteria (anaerobes, enterococci, coliforms, Group B Streptococci) were isolated in significantly higher numbers in the symptomatic group compared to the control group. Microscopy showed that the majority (73%) of the Candida vaginitis patients retained the normal Lactobacillus morphotype. In bacterial vaginitis Lactobacillus morphotype was replaced by other bacterial morphotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In our study 36% had candidiasis, 4.4% had trichomoniasis and 47% had bacterial vaginitis. In 12% there was no detectable pathogen. Microscopy of vaginal fluid is useful in determining the aetiology of vaginitis.
TI  - [Value of the score for Gram strains in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - The interpretation of Gram-stained slides of vaginal swab specimens is evaluated  for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and correlated with the isolation bacteria and clinical signs: thin homogeneous vaginal discharge, pH > or = 4.7, amine odor and presence of clue cells. Gram stained smears were scored following a morphotype classification: (a)-Lactobacillus morphotypes (scored 4 to 0), (b)-small Gram negative (G. vaginalis, scored 0 to 4), (c)-curved Gram variable rods (Mobiluncus morphotypes, scored 0 to 2). The scoring system (0 to 10) was a weighted combination of these morphotypes: a+b+c. The criterion for bacterial vaginosis was a score > or = 7, a score of 0 to 6 was considered as no bacterial vaginosis. Samples of 709 women, aged 18 to 84 (mean age = 39.7) were examined. The prevalence of G. vaginalis culture was 12.5%, and Mobiluncus infection occurred in 1.5%. The frequency of M. hominis was diagnosed in 2.8% of women. A score of 7 to 10 on Gram stain was observed in 9.7% in the population. Compared to G. vaginalis culture, Gram stained smear was more sensitive (0.71) than clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis (0.46). The specificity was similar with the two methods. The assessment of G. vaginalis morphotypes was highly correlated with the G. vaginalis culture (p < 0.001, OR = 248). The infection of T. vaginalis or Candida sp. was never associated with a score > or = 7. The Gram-stained smear is a cheap, fast and easy method. It provides good results for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  - The vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. Demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. BV, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (P < 0.01). The condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. BV was associated with low birth weight. Of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with BV were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (P < 0.0005). The presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative Lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and BV. BV-associated microorganisms, i.e., Mobiluncus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with BV (P = 0.0001 for each comparison). Mobiluncus curtisii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. Our study clearly indicates that BV and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.
TI  - Diagnostic microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized microbiologically by replacement of the Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides species, Mobiluncus species, and genital mycoplasmas. A standardized, laboratory-based diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis is desirable in those instances in which a microscope is unavailable in the clinic or when the evaluator of the wet mount examination is inexperienced at recognizing clue cells. Vaginal cultures have excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, but because the predictive value of a positive G. vaginalis culture is less than 50%, cultures are not recommended. Vaginal Gram smears are objective and reproducible, have 62% to 100% sensitivity, and have a positive predictive value of 76% to 100%. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with use of Papanicolaou-stained smears has been reported, but standardized criteria have not been widely adopted. A rapid, office-based oligonucleotide probe test for high concentrations of G. vaginalis has been developed and may be useful when direct microscopy is unavailable or confidence in microscopic examination is low. Laboratory tests that detect microbial products unique to the vaginal fluid of women with bacterial vaginosis include detection of amines (putrescine, cadaverine, and trimethylamine), measurement of the relative levels of succinate and lactate in the vaginal fluid by gas chromatography, detection of proline aminopeptidase by colorimetric assay, or detection of sialidases in the vaginal fluid. Although these tests are not yet applicable to routine use, these research tests could be adapted for wider use in office laboratories. Vaginal Gram stains are more useful than culture for laboratory confirmation of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. The major members of the group are Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Facultative species of Lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. The exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. The high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of tioconazole and its concentrations in vaginal  fluids following topical (vagistat-1 6.5%) application.
AB  - In vitro assays demonstrated that clinical yeasts were significantly more inhibited by tioconazole (MIC50, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) than by fluconazole (MIC50, 8 micrograms/ml). Tioconazole also exhibited high potency against most molds (Alterneria spp. and Acremonium spp.). All Candida tropicalis isolates had MICs of 8 micrograms/ml, four-fold greater than any other Candida spp. Generally Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible to tioconazole. Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was the most susceptible Gram-negative species. Staphylococci and enterococci were the most susceptible to tioconazole Gram-positive species (MIC50s, 1-8 micrograms/ml). Bacterial species associated with vaginosis. [Gardnerella vaginalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) and Prevotella biviadisiens (MIC90, 64 micrograms/ml)] were inhibited by tioconazole. Isolates of Lactobacillus spp. were most resistant (MIC90, > or = 256 micrograms/ml) to tioconazole. Vaginal fluid levels of tioconazole (mean, 91.4 micrograms/ml) persisted above the MIC90 levels (1-64 micrograms/ml) for most fungal and bacterial pathogens for 72 h in 19 evaluable female human subjects receiving 300 mg tioconazole in an intravaginal ointment.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - The vagina as an ecologic system. Current understanding and clinical applications.
AB  - Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of dominance of the healthful microecology by Lactobacillus acidophilus through microbicidal enzyme systems has led to renewed interest in ecologic approaches to vaginal health maintenance and treatment of vaginosis and vaginitis. Review of pertinent research suggests that due to inadequate adherence of lactobacilli from dairy sources, contaminants in commercial sources, and lack of evidence of effectiveness in sparse clinical trials, intravaginal applications of L. acidophilus cannot be recommended. Bacterial vaginosis is described in this article as a microecologic shift in the dominant organism of the microecology from L. acidophilus to Gardnerella vaginalis. This results in conditions favorable to vaginal establishment of many anaerobic organisms. The ability to identify and nurture healthful lactobacilli in the vaginal microflora is suggested as a future direction for health-enhancement-oriented research, practice, and screening.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of the Bacteroides fragilis group species and other anaerobic bacteria to meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined against 395 strains of strict and facultative anaerobes, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp. and Mobiluncus spp. The activities of meropenem and imipenem were within one dilution of their MIC50 and MIC90 values. One isolate of Bacteroides fragilis, two of Bacteroides distasonis, and two of Bacteroides ovatus showed resistance or diminished susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem. Metronidazole was active against almost all obligate anaerobic isolates. Some non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli and lactobacilli were resistant. Ampicillin/sulbactam inhibited almost all isolates at < or = 16/8 mg/L. The activity of clindamycin and cefoxitin was relatively good, but some strains of non-fragilis B. fragilis group species were resistant. Piperacillin was the least active agent tested.
TI  - [Recent bacteriologic data: from physiopathology to treatment].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the vaginal ecosystem in which Lactobacillus spp, the dominant members of the normal flora, are replaced by an association of various bacterial species including Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes (Bacteroides spp, Prevotella spp, Porphyromonas spp, Peptostreptococcus spp and Mobiluncus spp) and Mycoplasma hominis. The reasons for this imbalance are unknown, although the loss of lactobacilli that produce hydrogen peroxide (which is toxic for G. vaginalis and numerous anaerobes) may be an essential element. The introduction of one or several of these species into the vagina (they can occasionally be isolated in small numbers even in the absence of vaginosis) following intercourse or from the intestinal tract may also play a role. G. vaginalis itself is not considered to cause vaginosis, but is almost always present and multiplies rapidly; in addition, it has a high capacity for adherence to epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. It is now agreed that the concomitant growth of one or several anaerobic species is required for bacterial vaginosis to develop. Our knowledge of the bacteriology of bacterial vaginosis has implications for diagnosis and treatment. It is now possible to obtain a precise bacteriologic diagnosis, not by culturing G. vaginalis (a costly and low-yield procedure), but by direct examination of the vaginal flora after Gram staining, which shows the replacement of lactobacilli by a characteristic polymorphic flora. Therapy is based on the use of antibiotics such as the imidazoles, which are active against G. vaginalis and anaerobes, but not against the commensal lactobacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  - Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. High concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. Like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.25 microgram/ml). Rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Mobiluncus spp. strains (all MICs < or = 1 microgram/ml). Strains of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. However, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were rifaximin resistant, for example, Candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to rifamycin resistance.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis in infections of reproductive organs].
AB  - The study was aimed at multidirectional studies on bacteria isolated from smears  from vagina and cervix uteri in 226 patients with inflammatory states of their reproductive organs. Most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were Gram-negative--27%, mainly E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis--in 18% of cases. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 81% of cases: Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 28% and Lactobacillus in 53% of cases. Other anaerobic bacteria were: Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (15.5%), Streptococcus sp. (15.9%), and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14.1%). Gardnerella vaginalis was most frequently found in chronic cases of vaginosis (41.7%). All strains of G. vaginalis were susceptible to cefotaxime, while 15-40% of them were resistant to gentamycin, tetracycline and metronidazole.
TI  - [Benzidamine in the topical treatment of vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - The present clinical trial has been carried out in order to evaluate the efficacy of benzydamine in treatment of vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis. Fifty women affected by this specific pathology have been submitted to topical treatment with 0.5% benzydamine vaginal cream. The treatment has been carried out for 9 consecutive days using a local application of benzydamine twice a day. The clinical result was evaluated after 12 and 60 days. The following parameters were taken into consideration: symptoms (leucorrhea, itching, burning), clinical signs (oedema, hyperemia, vaginal secretion), instrumental data (pH, colposcopy, sniff test) and microbiological findings (searching of clue cells, Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis). At the first check point after 12 days 84% of patients have been considered healed; at the second check the percentage of healing rose to 92%. Therefore benzydamine was considered highly effective in 92% of vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis.

TI  - The relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  - Lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. The role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. Vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of H2O2-positive and H2O2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. Compared with women with H2O2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized by H2O2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and viridans streptococci (P less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). In addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with H2O2-positive lactobacilli to have Chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by Enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than .05 for each comparison). Vaginal colonization by group B streptococci or Escherichia coli was not related to the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli. These data suggest that the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in a gynaecology clinic.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in women referred to a gynaecology clinic, and to compare two methods of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. SETTING: Gynaecology Clinic at Northwick Park Hospital SUBJECTS: 114 women aged 16 to 65 referred consecutively to the gynaecology clinic of one consultant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of bacterial vaginosis by standard compound criteria and by examination of a Gram stained smear of fluid from the posterior vaginal fornix. RESULTS: Bacterial vaginosis was detected by both the Gram stain and the compound criteria in 13 women. There was no correlation between the symptom of vaginal discharge and the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in this population, but the presence of discharge noted by the clinician was associated with bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis was 11%. The Gram stain provides a simple and inexpensive method for laboratory confirmation of bacterial vaginosis where facilities for using the compound criteria are not available.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine gluconate douche on normal vaginal flora.
AB  - The effects of a 0.5% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) douche on the normal  vaginal flora of twenty healthy nonpregnant volunteers were investigated. The douche was applied in a premeasured 180-ml quantity daily for 7 consecutive days. Specimens for aerobic and anaerobic culture of the vaginal flora were obtained on 3 occasions from each volunteer, once before and twice after CHG use. The culture results were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. A blood sample was also collected within 24 h of the last CHG application to determine serum CHG concentration. Lactobacillus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most prevalent aerobic bacteria at all phases of the study and Bacteroides spp. were the most prevalent anaerobes. The composition of the normal flora was essentially the same 30 days after the last dose as the pretreatment flora. Small amounts of CHG were detected in the serum of all but one subject. No untoward effects on the participants were observed. Candida albicans counts were slightly higher, but prevalence was not significantly increased at the end of the study.
TI  - Nonoxynol-9: differential antibacterial activity and enhancement of bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - The antibacterial activity and adherence-enhancing effects of nonoxynol-9 were evaluated against vaginal and uropathogenic bacteria. Nonoxynol-9 was markedly less active against the 43 uropathogenic bacterial and yeast strains tested (MIC90, greater than 32%) than against the 26 Gardnerella vaginalis strains (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.015%) and the 53 Lactobacillus strains (MIC90, 8%) tested. Hydrogen peroxide-producing strains of Lactobacillus were more susceptible to nonoxynol-9 (MIC90, 4%) than nonproducers (MIC90, 16%). Two Escherichia coli strains that expressed type 1 fimbriae and three vaginal strains of lactobacilli adhered in significantly higher numbers to vaginal epithelial cells preincubated with 5% nonoxynol-9 than to control cells preincubated with PBS. Spermicides may provide a selective advantage in colonizing the vagina with nonoxynol-9-resistant uropathogens such as E. coli, perhaps via a reduction in vaginal lactobacilli (especially hydrogen peroxide-producing strains) and through enhancement of adherence of E. coli to epithelial cells.
TI  - The vaginal ecosystem.
AB  - The ecology of vaginal flora is highly susceptible to numerous endogenous and exogenous influences. Possible mechanisms that might influence changes in the vaginal flora are microbial antibiosis, adhesion to the vaginal epithelial lining, e.g., availability of receptors, hormonal changes including physiologic alterations, disease states, drug therapy, sexual activity, and to a lesser extent, the immunologic status of the person. The role that these mechanisms may play in promoting vaginitis, vaginosis, and possibly pelvic inflammatory disease is explored.
TI  - Direct Gram's stain of vaginal discharge as a means of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) by direct gram-stained smear of vaginal discharge was evaluated in 90 consecutive patients. Vaginal secretions from 20 healthy female volunteers were also examined. All specimens were examined by culture for growth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus spp. Only 35 (38.9%) of the patients with vaginal discharge satisfied the clinical diagnosis of BV. The vaginal gram-stained smear from all these 35 patients contained typical gardnerella morphotypes characteristic of BV and G. vaginalis was isolated from all of them as well as from a further 10 patients who did not satisfy the criteria for diagnosis of BV. The semi-quantitative assessment of gardnerella morphotypes was found to correlate positively with the semi-quantitative assessment of G. vaginalis growth by culture (p less than 0.0001). There was a strong inverse relationship between the quantity of lactobacillus and gardnerella morphotypes. Direct gram-staining of smears should facilitate the diagnosis of BV for clinicians with minimum need for confirmation by culture, particularly in a third world setting with few or no laboratory facilities.
TI  - Antibiosis between bacteria isolated from the vagina of women with and without signs of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Lactobacilli from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) were tested for H2O2 production. Thirty-seven (79%) of the 47 strains of lactobacilli isolated from the women without BV produced H2O2, while only nine (23%) of the 39 strains of lactobacilli obtained from women with BV did so. Five of 20 H2O2-producing and two of 26 non-producing strains of Lactobacillus exhibited antibiosis against four of 12 strains of peptostreptococci and two of 10 strains of Mobiluncus spp. None of a further 41 different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial strains were inhibited by any of the isolates of lactobacilli tested. Some strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteriodes spp., Mobiluncus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. inhibited the growth of three strains of lactobacilli belonging to different species. When the pH of the culture medium was increased from 6.0 to 6.5 this led to a decrease in the number of strains inhibited and/or the size of the growth-inhibitory zones. Different concentrations of H2O2 did not inhibit any of the strains tested. The growth-inhibitory effect of lactobacilli could not be related to their bacteriocin production. Increasing the iron content of the medium by adding FeCl3 (0.01 mM-1 mM) decreased or completely abolished the antibiosis.
TI  - Control of the microbial flora of the vagina by H2O2-generating lactobacilli.
AB  - H2O2-generating lactobacilli (LB+) are present in the vagina of most normal women but are absent from most women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). LB+ at high concentration was toxic to Gardnerella vaginalis (the predominant organism in the vagina of women with BV); when the LB+ was lowered to a level where it was ineffective alone, the addition of myeloperoxidase and chloride reinstituted toxicity. Toxicity was inhibited by catalase and was not seen when H2O2-negative lactobacilli were used, implicating H2O2 as the toxic molecule. LB+ could be replaced by H2O2 and chloride by iodide, bromide, or thiocyanate. The optimum pH for inhibition of G. vaginalis was 5.0-6.0 LB+ also was autoinhibitory when combined with myeloperoxidase and chloride. LB+ alone at low concentrations was toxic to Bacteroides bivius through the formation of H2O2. Adequate amounts of peroxidase were found in the vagina of 17 of 21 women. These findings suggest that LB+ may contribute to the control of the vaginal flora, particularly in the presence of peroxidase and a halide.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  - Molecular probe for identification of Trichomonas vaginalis DNA.
AB  - Trichomoniasis is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases in the world. Diagnosis can be achieved by several methods, such as direct microscopic observation of vaginal discharge, cell culture, and immunological techniques. A 2.3-kb Trichomonas vaginalis DNA fragment present in strains from diverse geographic areas was cloned and used as a probe to detect T. vaginalis DNA in vaginal discharge by a dot blot hybridization technique. This probe was specific for T. vaginalis DNA. It recognized strains from two regions in Italy (Sardinia, Piemonte) and from Mozambique (Africa). In addition, our probe did not cross-react with bacterial (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Lactobacillus spp.), viral (herpes simplex virus type 2), fungal (Candida albicans), protozoan (Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, and Leishmania infantum), or human nucleic acids. The probe reacted with Pentatrichomonas hominis and Trichomonas foetus. The limit signal recognized by our probe corresponded to the DNA of 200 T. vaginalis isolates. The 2.3-kb probe was used in a clinical analysis of 98 samples. Of these, 20 samples were found to be positive both with the probe and by cell culture, and only 14 of these were positive by a standard wet mount method.
TI  - Microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal clindamycin cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma hominis. The present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. Sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. Quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. At enrollment, G vaginalis was recovered from 99%, Bacteroides sp from 94%, Peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and M hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. The vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. The mean log concentration was 1.2 X 10(9) cfu/mL for aerobic and 2.6 X 10(8) cfu/mL for anaerobic bacteria. After treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for G vaginalis, Bacteroides sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, and M hominis. The 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. Treatment with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. Therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of Lactobacillus, and a probably transient increase in the frequency of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. Accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis Bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in Lactobacillus sp. Excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and G. Vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal pH constitute the hallmark of diagnosis. The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. Bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. It is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. Therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. Women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. The cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. New data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. No evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  - The distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet K, Tet L, Tet M, and Tet O were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Veillonella parvula. Among the Peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for Tet K (27%), Tet L (30%), Tet M (75%) and Tet O (13%). Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant. The data indicate that tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.
TI  - A new look at the diagnosis of infection of the urinary tract and its adjacent structures.
AB  - The criterion enunciated by Kass for interpreting the quantitative examination of urine is critically reappraised. The role of organisms other than those of the aerobic bowel flora, especially fastidious organisms, in urinary tract infections is discussed in detail. Clinical microbiologists are urged to pay more attention to the bacteriological examination of urine and to play a greater part in the diagnosis and treatment of infections of the urinary tract and its adjacent structures.

TI  - Interstitial cystitis and the urethral syndrome: a possible answer.
AB  - A study was made of 20 patients fulfilling the criteria customarily used for the  diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. A possible infective aetiology was sought by culture of bladder tissue, catheter and midstream specimens of urine, and urethral swabs by methods capable of detecting fastidious bacteria as well as aerobic pathogens. All bladder biopsies showed the histological appearances usually associated with interstitial cystitis, and bacteria were isolated from the catheter specimens and/or bladder biopsies of 12 patients. Eight of these isolates were fastidious bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis (6) and Lactobacillus sp. (2). Fastidious bacteria were isolated from the midstream specimen of urine (MSU) and/or urethral swab of 6 other patients. The correlation of the histological and bacteriological findings supports the hypothesis of an infective aetiology and suggests that the so-called urethral syndrome and interstitial cystitis may be the earlier and later stages of the same disease process. The importance of early diagnosis of infection in these patients is emphasised.
TI  - Prevalence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus species in normal women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A predominance of Lactobacillus species in the vaginal flora is considered normal. In women with bacterial vaginosis, the prevalence and concentrations of intravaginal Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes are increased, whereas the prevalence of intravaginal Lactobacillus species is decreased. Because some lactobacilli are known to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can be toxic to organisms that produce little or no H2O2-scavenging enzymes (e.g., catalase), we postulated that an absence of H2O2-producing Lactobacillus species could allow an overgrowth of catalase-negative organisms, such as those found among women with bacterial vaginosis. In this study, H2O2-producing facultative Lactobacillus species were found in the vaginas of 27 (96%) of 28 normal women and 4 (6%) of 67 women with bacterial vaginosis (P less than 0.001). Anaerobic Lactobacillus species (which do not produce hydrogen peroxide) were isolated from 24 (36%) of 67 women with bacterial vaginosis and 1 (4%) of 28 normal women (P less than 0.001). The production of H2O2 by Lactobacillus species may represent a nonspecific antimicrobial defense mechanism of the normal vaginal ecosystem.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis is not a simple ecological disorder.
AB  - Eighty-four patients with bacterial vaginosis were examined in an open randomized trial, the aim of which was to define clinical results and the microbiological panorama after topical treatment for 1 week with either an acetic acid jelly (A), an estrogen cream (B), a fermented milk product (C) or metronidazole (D). After exclusion because of chlamydia infection (15 cases) or for other reasons, 61 cases remained for complete evaluation 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Clinical cure was obtained in 3 cases out of 17 on regimen A, in 1 out of 16 on regimen B, in 1 of 14 on regimen C, and in 13 out of 14 on regimen D. The patients were conclusively either symptomless or symptomatic when examined on 113 occasions. Statistically significant reduction after treatment resulting in relief of symptoms was observed in the numbers of corynebacteria and anaerobic cocci, whereas lactobacilli increased in numbers. The instillation of high numbers of Lactobacillus acidophilus (C) into the vagina cured only 1 patient and did not influence the predominance of lactobacilli in the vagina at the follow-up examination. The difference in microbiological profile of women in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions becomes still more apparent when the results of the present and previously published studies on the subject by the present group of investigators are combined. The symptomatic woman is significantly more often harboring corynebacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococci, peptococci, eubacteria and Bacteroides species. Lactobacilli are significantly reduced in numbers. However, only 51% of our previously symptomatic, but now symptomless women show predominant growth of lactobacilli, which is less than expected for healthy women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Diagnosis and clinical manifestations of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Among 640 randomly selected women who were attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic and did not have trichomoniasis, 33% had bacterial vaginosis as defined by a composite of four clinical criteria: (1) Vaginal discharge was homogeneous; (2) vaginal discharge had a pH greater than or equal to 4.7; (3) vaginal discharge had an amine-like odor when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide; (4) vaginal discharge contained clue cells representing greater than or equal to 20% of vaginal epithelial cells. Previously published Gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis correlated better than results of semiquantitative cultures for Gardnerella vaginalis with presence or absence of clue cells and with composite clinical criteria. Of 293 women with bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain criteria, 65% had symptoms of increased vaginal discharge and/or vaginal malodor, while 74% had signs of characteristic homogeneous vaginal discharge or amine-like odor. Elevated vaginal pH was the least specific and amine-like odor the least sensitive sign of bacterial vaginosis. Gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis were not associated with the concentrations of endocervical or vaginal inflammatory cells but were significantly associated with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. After adjusting for coinfection, sexual behavior, and other variables, bacterial vaginosis remained associated with adnexal tenderness (odds ratio = 9.2, p = 0.04). Bacterial vaginosis, previously implicated as a risk factor for obstetric infections, may be a risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease.
TI  - [Cervico-vaginal pathogens and contraception: microbiological observations].
AB  - The authors relate the results about 172 vaginal and cervical swabs, in women with or without oral/local (IUD) contraception, with or without vaginosis/vaginitis. Gardnerella vaginalis was always prevalent; the authors observed an high correlation between cervical IUD and vaginal Gardnerella, more than IUD and cervical Chlamydia trachomatis. Bacterial associations in Gardnerella vaginalis (Mobiluncus, obligate anaerobes) are related; incidence of Candida and Trichomonas vaginalis are reported; correlation between these microbial agents and contraception are discussed.
TI  - The midcycle cervical microbial flora as studied by the weighed-swab method, and  its possible correlation with results of sperm cervical mucus penetration tests.
AB  - Infertile couples undergoing routine investigation for infertility were randomly  selected for the study. A quantitative method using weighed swabs was found satisfactory for the study of microbial flora in the midcycle cervical mucus. In 6 of the 20 women, the midcycle cervical mucus was hostile in the sperm cervical mucus penetration tests. The total bacterial counts and the number of species (average, 2.5) isolated from the hostile mucus were significantly greater than those from the receptive mucus (average, 1.3). Only normal vaginal/cervical flora was isolated. Ureaplasma urealyticum was found more frequently in patients undergoing clomiphene citrate therapy (6/10 versus 0/9, P less than 0.03, Fischer's Exact test).
TI  - The acute urethral syndrome in routine practice.
AB  - Midstream samples of urine from 185 acutely dysuric women and 89 symptom-free controls were screened according to the modified criteria of Kass by both conventional and microaerophilic culture. Among the 185 symptomatic women, coliform bacilli were isolated from 125 (67.5%) and in 45 (36%) of the latter the concentration of these organisms in the urine was less than 10(8)/l. Fastidious organisms were isolated in pure and mixed cultures from 25 (13.4%) of the 185 patients and from 4 (4.5%) of 89 controls. Staphylococcus species were isolated from 10.8% (9.7% S. saprophyticus; 1.1% S. epidermidis) and Ureaplasma urealyticum from 2.7%. All patients infected with conventional organisms but only 30.4% of those yielding fastidious organisms had pyuria. The isolation rate of fastidious organisms tended to be higher (P = 0.055) in symptomatic women that in symptom-free controls.
TI  - [Bacteriologic studies in premature rupture of fetal membranes and correlation with the clinical aspects of chorioamnionitis and the amnion infection syndrome].
AB  - One of the major complications following premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) is ascending infection. In this aspect the bacteria of the vaginal flora play a major part. Bacterial spectra of a group with PROM and another control group with punctual rupture of the membranes are comparatively analysed. This analysis is based on swabs taken from vagina and newborns. Data are interpreted in correlation to clinical picture of chorioamnionitis and amnion infection syndrome (AIS). Twelve newborns clinical suspected to have a neonatal infection are retrospectively judged. In the group with pregnant women with PROM potential pathological germs such as group B streptococci and E. coli are found more often, whereas physiological flora, specially Lactobacillus species, are clearly reduced. In newborns with AIS even germs can be detected, which so far have seemed to be more apathogenic, such as Gardnerella vaginalis. Bacteriological findings are discussed in connection with clinical parameters, specially group B streptococci are looked at more precisely. In newborns with AIS microbiological results are demonstrated including course of pregnancy and delivery. For the management of PROM alternatives are shown and advice for prophylaxis is given.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - On a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 Lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. Inhibition zones were observed in the growth of all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. The inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. Four Bacteroides fragilis strains as well as 2 out of 4 Staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. The inhibition zones were generally wider at pH 5.5 than at 6.0. For all inhibited strains, (the S. aureus excepted) a low pH on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.
TI  - Vaginitis: current microbiologic and clinical concepts.
AB  - Infectious vaginitis occurs when the normal vaginal flora is disrupted; it may arise when saprophytes overwhelm the host immune response, when pathogenic organisms are introduced into the vagina or when changes in substrate allow an imbalance of microorganisms to develop. Examples of these types of vaginitis include the presence of chronic fungal infection in women with an inadequate cellular immune response to the yeast, the introduction of trichomonads into vaginal epithelium that has a sufficient supply of glycogen, and the alteration in bacterial flora, normally dominated by Lactobacillus spp., and its metabolites that is characteristic of "nonspecific vaginitis". The authors review microbiologic and clinical aspects of the fungal, protozoal and bacterial infections, including the interactions of bacteria thought to produce nonspecific vaginitis, that are now recognized as causing vaginitis. Other causes of vaginitis are also discussed.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial vaginosis with an acid cream: a comparison between the effect of lactate-gel and metronidazole.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of anaerobes, Gardnerella and lactobacilli was carried  out in a group of 62 women with the diagnosis bacterial vaginosis and 42 control women. Lactobacilli were the predominant organisms in the control group whereas anaerobes dominated the flora in bacterial vaginosis patients. Lactate-gel (pH 3.5, 5 ml) inserted into the vagina daily for 7 days is as effective as oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. The women in both groups became symptom-free and objectively improved. Anaerobes were significantly reduced (p less than 0.0001) in both groups after 1-week treatment but Gardnerella was not significantly reduced. As bacterial vaginosis is generally looked upon as a mild noninflammatory condition lactate-gel seems to be an ideal treatment for this disease.
TI  - In vitro adherence of Lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of Lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus isolated from three commercial yogurts were compared to L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. cellobiosus, and L. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from American Type Culture Collection cultures. L. acidophilus isolated from Lactinex tablets was also tested. No significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the American Type Culture Collection cultures, and the Lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any Lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
TI  - Microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - The prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, lactobacillus, Mycoplasma species, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. Sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (SD = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (SD = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (P = 0.001). Sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal G. vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma species, and U. urealyticum, as well as endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoea, and T. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. Significant differences in isolation rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis. In general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; N. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. Differences were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific vaginitis. Vaginal G. vaginalis and Mycoplasma species and endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. It is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - Thirty-four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were studied. They were isolated from non specific vaginitis. A presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, Gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. The differentiation of Gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in GLC. All Gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. They are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of the vaginal flora in genital disease.
AB  - Samples from the posterior vaginal fornix of 102 women with various clinical conditions were analysed by a quantitative method. Aerobes were isolated from all but one of the specimens at a mean concentration of 7.2 log10 cfu/g and anaerobes from 92 specimens at a mean concentration of 8.1 log10 cfu/g. In most clinical conditions and in a control group of asymptomatic women, anaerobes outnumbered aerobes by about ten to one (one log10 unit). The most common organisms were aerobic and anaerobic lactobacilli, coryneforms, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides spp. and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. Lactobacilli did not appear to confer any protective effect by excluding the presence of other organisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis or anaerobes. The isolation of anaerobic organisms from the vagina cannot be regarded as being of pathogenic significance without other supporting evidence.
TI  - Microbiology of vaginitis associated with the intrauterine contraceptive device.
AB  - A malodorous, homogeneous, grey, thin and non-purulent discharge, which resembles non-specific vaginitis occurs in 20% of women with an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD); four times more common than in non-users. The aim of this investigation was to study the bacteriological aetiology of this IUCD-associated vaginal discharge, and to assess whether the infection was ascendent. No specific microbiological aetiology was found, but the normal, Lactobacillus-dominated microbial vaginal flora was replaced by Gardnerella vaginalis and certain anaerobic species in IUCD-users with the discharge. Clue cells, pepper-salt phenomenon and curved rods and/or fusiform-shaped rods demonstrated by microscopy, were typical of symptomatic patients. The endometrium and the IUCD were infected with these species in the symptomatic group more often than in IUCD-users who had no symptoms or in the control women who did not use the IUCD.
TI  - [Role of Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes. Etiology of nonspecific colpitis].
AB  - Nonspecific vaginitis is a very common clinical syndrome. In patients with nonspecific vaginitis the normal, lactobacillus-dominated microbial flora is replaced by Gardnerella vaginalis and certain anaerobes, preferably bacteroides spp. The mechanisms by which anaerobes or Gardnerella vaginalis or a combination of these organisms produce the disease condition are still unknown. Treatment with ampicillin and certain other drugs is often effective, but metronidazole appears to be the most effective antimicrobial for this condition. The optimal dose and duration of metronidazole therapy require further study.
TI  - Gardnerella-associated vaginitis and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - 12 patients with mild or moderate symptoms of Gardnerella-associated vaginitis were examined clinically and microbiologically on 52 different occasions, 27 of which were asymptomatic. The symptomatic state was defined by fulfilling at least three of the following criteria: (1) subjective symptoms; (2) pH above 4.5; (3) positive amine test, and (4) clue cells in wet smear. Variation of the vaginal microflora was considerable. No causative bacterial species could be identified. Microorganisms of the genus Bacteroides were significantly (p less than 0.02) more often found in the symptomatic condition. The presence of either peptococci , peptostreptococci or anaerobic streptococci was similarly related to symptoms (p less than 0.01). Lactobacilli were significantly more often present when the patient was free of symptoms (p less than 0.05). Gardnerella vaginalis was a common isolate whether the patient suffered from symptoms or not. It is concluded that the presence of this microorganism indicates a disturbed ecologic situation within the vagina, resulting in loss of predominance of lactobacilli and hence liability to develop symptoms.

TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by direct gram stain of vaginal fluid.
AB  - To determine whether bacterial vaginosis (BV), also known as nonspecific vaginitis, could be diagnosed by evaluating a Gram stain of vaginal fluid, we examined samples from 60 women of whom 25 had clinical evidence of BV and 35 had candidal vaginitis or normal examinations. An inverse relationship between the quantity of the Lactobacillus morphotype (large gram-positive rods) and of the Gardnerella morphotype (small gram-variable rods) was noted on Gram stain (P less than 0.001). When Gram stain showed a predominance (3 to 4+) of the Lactobacillus morphotype with or without the Gardnerella morphotype, it was interpreted as normal. When Gram stain showed mixed flora consisting of gram-positive, gram-negative, or gram-variable bacteria and the Lactobacillus morphotype was decreased or absent (0 to 2+), the Gram stain was interpreted as consistent with BV. Gram stain was consistent with BV in 25 of 25 women given a clinical diagnosis of BV and in none of 35 women with candidal vaginitis or normal examinations. Duplicate slides prepared from 20 additional specimens of vaginal fluid were stained by two methods and examined by three evaluators. Interevaluator interpretations and intraevaluator interpretations of duplicate slides were in agreement with one another and with the clinical diagnosis greater than or equal to 90% of the time. We concluded that a microscopically detectable change in vaginal microflora from the Lactobacillus morphotype, with or without the Gardnerella morphotype (normal), to a mixed flora with few or no Lactobacillus morphotypes (BV) can be used in the diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Microbial flora in women showing symptoms of nonspecific vaginosis: applicability of KOH test for diagnosis.
AB  - The microbial flora of the vagina in 100 consecutive patients coming to a gynaecologist's office because of excessive and malodourous vaginal discharge was investigated. Anaerobic bacteria were detected in 66% of cases, and Gardnerella vaginalis in 59% of cases. Lactobacilli were present in 52% of cases, Candida in 19%, Chlamydia trachomatis in 6% and Trichomonas vaginalis in 5%. Among the anaerobic bacteria, various strains of Bacteroides or Fusobacteria were the most common. The positive predictivity of KOH test varied from 86 to 98%. Its specificity was equally good, but its sensitivity was lower, in the range 66 to 76%.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in the etiology of bacterial (nonspecific) vaginosis.
AB  - G. vaginalis was originally described as the etiologic agent of bacterial vaginosis (nonspecific vaginitis) because it was recovered only from women with signs and symptoms of "bacterial vaginitis" and not from normal controls. Recent data have shown that G. vaginalis is present in normal women but at concentrations lower than the limit of sensitivity of the media formerly used. Detection of low concentrations of G. vaginalis in normal controls has been made possible by development of a selective and differential medium (HBT). Anaerobically performed studies of the vaginal flora have indicated that while lactobacilli predominate in the normal vagina with or without G. vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides spp., Peptococcus spp., Eubacterium spp. and curved rods as well as G. vaginalis predominate in bacterial vaginosis. Anaerobic bacteria and G. vaginalis are decreased after appropriate therapy. After treatment with metronidazole, lactobacilli again predominate. Lactobacilli are less prevalent after treatment with ampicillin or amoxicillin. These data suggest that as in infections at other mucous membrane sites, bacterial vaginosis is a mixed infection involving a finite number of facultative and anaerobic species. The data also suggest an important role for facultative lactobacilli.
TI  - Metronidazole in treatment of non-specific vaginitis. Clinical and microbiological findings in ten patients given 2 grams of metronidazole.
AB  - A 2 gram single dose of metronidazole was given to ten patients suffering from nonspecific vaginitis. At follow-up a week later seven of these patients were clinically and microbiologically free from infection. The remaining three patients had persisting symptoms and both clinical and microbiological findings confirmed treatment failure. Despite the small numbers entered into the trial to date, a cure rate of only seven out of ten patients suggests that a 2 gram single dose of metronidazole is inadequate treatment for non-specific vaginitis.
TI  - Diagnosis and therapy of nonspecific vaginitis. Correlation between KOH-test, clue cells and microbiology.
AB  - A clinical and quantitative microbiological study was performed on 32 women with  fishy odour of the vaginal fluid. This odour could be intensified by the addition of one drop of 10% potassium hydroxide. Clue cells were found to be present in all cases. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the vaginal fluid in 97%, and large quantities of mixed anaerobes in 100% of the patients. The therapy with metronidazole, 400 mg twice daily for 5 days, was successful in 22 out of 24 patients. After therapy the fishy odour and the clue cells were no longer detectable. G. vaginalis and anaerobes could only be isolated sporadically and in small quantities. The isolation rate of Lactobacillus species increased from 3% to 86% within one week.
TI  - The vaginal microbial flora in non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - The facultative and strictly anaerobic vaginal microbial flora was investigated in 40 women with non-specific vaginitis and in 40 control women seen in private gynaecological practice. Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive cocci were all associated with non-specific vaginitis (p less than 0.001), whereas lactobacilli occurred less frequently in non-specific vaginitis than in controls (p less than 0.01). The most common anaerobes were Veillonella parvula, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides assaccharolyticus, Bacteroides capillosus and Peptococcus asaccharolyticus. Anaerobic gram-negative curved rods were found in 11% of cases of non-specific vaginitis. A characteristic pattern of short chain organic acids was found on gas liquid chromatographic analysis of vaginal secretions in non-specific vaginitis. A succinate/lactate peak ratio of 0.3 or more was found in 75% of women with non-specific vaginitis (p less than 0.001). Clue cells, a positive amine test, a pH higher than 5.0, and the absence of lactobacilli on a Gram stained vaginal smear strongly correlated with non-specific vaginitis (p less than 0.001).
TI  - [Incidence and clinical importance of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginalis) (author's transl)].
AB  - In 250 women aged between 16 and 55 years who came to a gynaecologist we looked for haemophilus vaginalis. In 9.6% it was possible to culture haemophilus vaginalis. The comparison of the differential vaginalis (V-)medium of Greenwood with the starch medium of Smith showed the much better resolution of the Greenwood medium. In one-half of the patients with haemophilus vaginalis there was no clinical evidence of pathogenicity of the bacterium, whereas in the other half, there was only a slight symptomatology. Haemophilus vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus seem to exclude each other. The strains of haemophilus vaginalis were resistant to sulfonamides, polymyxin B and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial and fungal adherence to vaginal exfoliated epithelial cells and human vaginal epithelial tissue culture cells.
AB  - The adherence of four bacterial species and Candida albicans to a new in vitro tissue culture model of human vaginal stratified squamous epithelium was investigated and compared with in vitro adherence to vaginal exfoliated cells. Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococci, Lactobacillus sp., and C. albicans adhered well to both exfoliated and tissue culture cells. Similarly, a piliated fecal isolate of Escherichia coli, but not a nonpiliated vaginal isolate of E. coli, adhered well to both cell types. Adherence of the piliated E. coli was markedly inhibited by preincubation of bacteria with D-mannose. No inhibition of adherence by D-mannose of G. vaginalis, nonpiliated E. coli, and C. albicans was demonstrated. Scanning electron microscopy of tissue cultures showed nonuniform distribution of adherent microorganisms with diminished adherence in areas of active mitosis and proliferation and increased adherence to mature flat cells, often in the process of desquamation.
TI  - The effect of a contraceptive vaginal ring and oral contraceptives on the vaginal flora.
AB  - Premenopausal women seeking a steroid contraceptive method were allowed to choose between a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) containing levonorgestrel and estradiol used in a 3-week in, 1-week out regimen (n=20) and an oral contraceptive (OC) containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol in a 28-day regimen (n = 10). Cultures from the posterior vaginal fornix were obtained before therapy in both groups and monthly for 6 months for the CVR group and after 1, 3, and 6 months for the OC group. These cultures were streaked on specific media to provide quantitative aerobic and anaerobic, lactobacillus, Candida sp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae counts in micro-organisms per milliliter. A comparison of the number and types of organisms isolated from vaginal cultures obtained initially and at 6 months demonstrated no statistically significant differences in colony counts between CVR and OC users. The results of this study suggest that the use of the CVR is not associated with a greater growth of pathogens than is oral administration of a progestin and estrogen combination.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to vaginal epithelial cells at various times in the menstrual cycle.
AB  - Adherence of vaginal isolates of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus species, group B streptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells was studied in 10 healthy, sexually active medical students. Studies were done pre- and postmenstrually and at midcycle for two consecutive menstrual cycles. The mean number of adherent bacteria per vaginal epithelial cell (range) was 3.4 (0 to 14) for E. coli, 60.5 (12 to 152) for Lactobacillus species, 54.8 (21 to 76) for group B streptococci, 67.4 (15 to 161) for G. vaginalis, and 58.9 (15 to 186) diplococci for N. gonorrhoeae. Adherence of G. vaginalis increased with increasing acidity of the test medium (pH 4 to 8). There were no significant differences in adherence to vaginal epithelial cells obtained at the various times in the menstrual cycle for any of the organisms (p greater than 0.05). The pattern and extent of adherence among the women was similar for each organism. In this in vitro model, adherence characteristics did not vary with the menstrual cycle.
TI  - Nonspecific vaginosis.
AB  - Nonspecific vaginosis (NSV) is a very common clinical syndrome with characteristic clinical, biochemical, and microbiologic features. There is a thin, malodorous homogeneous, grey, nonpurulent vaginal discharge. The discharge usually has a pH greater than 4.5, contains "clue cells" on wet mount examination, and produces a "fishy" odor when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide. The discharge contains an increased concentration of at least seven amines which are presumably produced by bacterial decarboxylases; and several volatile and non-volatile organic acid metabolites of anaerobic bacteria. Although the pathogenesis of NSV is not understood, the normal, lactobacillus-dominated microbial flora is replaced by Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis and certain anaerobic species. Treatment with sulfonamide creams or oral tetracycline is usually ineffective. Ampicillin is often effective, but metronidazole appears to be the most effective antimicrobial for this condition. The optimal dose of metronidazole, and the need for treatment of sex partners, require further study.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - To study the cause of nonspecific vaginitis, we analyzed vaginal fluid from normal women and from 53 women with nonspecific vaginitis, using quantitative anaerobic cultures and gas-liquid chromatography for short-chained organic-acid metabolites of the microbial flora. In normal vaginal fluid, lactate was the predominant acid, and the predominant organisms were lactobacillus and streptococcus species (lactate producers). In nonspecific vaginitis, lactate was decreased, whereas succinate, acetate, butyrate, and propionate were increased, the predominant flora included Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis (acetate producer), and anaerobes, which included bacteroides species (succinate producers) and peptococcus species (butyrate and acetate producers). After metronidazole therapy, symptoms and signs of nonspecific vaginitis cleared, butyrate and propionate disappeared, and lactate and lactate-producing organisms became predominant. We conclude that certain anaerobes act with G. vaginalis as causes of nonspecific vaginitis, and that a high ratio of succinate to lactate in vaginal fluid is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of this condition.
TI  - A taxonomic study of Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis) Gardner and Dukes 1955.
AB  - Fifty-five strains received as Haemophilus vaginalis or as catalase-negative coryneform bacteria from the vagina together with 61 marker cultures were subjected to numerical phenetic analyses using 149 unit characters. The data were examined using the simple matching (SSM), Jaccard (SJ) and pattern (DP) coefficients and clustering was achieved using the average linkage algorithm. Cluster composition was not markedly affected by the coefficient used or by test error, estimated at 6 . 5%. The H. vaginalis strains formed a tight cluster which was only distantly related to representatives of the genera arthrobacter, Cellulomonas, Corynebacterium sensu stricto, Erysipelothrix, Haemophilus, Kurthia, Lactobacillus, Listeria and Propionibacterium but shared a high overall affinity to unclassified catalase-negative coryneforms which formed a discrete taxon, cluster 9. The H. vaginalis strains could be distinguished from the related strains in cluster 9 by several unrelated phenotypic characters. Using the S1 endonuclease assay, DNA-DNA hybridizations were performed with representative strains from the numerical as well as with reference strains of Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces. Haemophilus vaginalis was found to be a genotypically legitimate group and its DNA showed little homology with DNA from the marker strains tested. The DNA base composition of H. vaginalis was 42 to 44 mol % guanine plus cytosine. A new genus should be created to incorporate strains known as H. vaginalis or Corynebacterium vaginale. The name Gardnerella vaginalis proposed by Greenwood & Pickett (1979) is supported.
