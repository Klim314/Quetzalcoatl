TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == [comparison of the intraradicular bacterial community structures of teeth with or without post-treatment periapical periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to compare the intraradicular bacterial community structures of teeth  with or without post-treatment periapical periodontitis and to explore the suspicious microorganisms that is related to persistent periapical infection. methods: the intraradicular biofilm samples were collected from 10 post-treatment periapical periodontitis teeth (apical periodontitis group) and 10 teeth without  post-treatment periapical periodontitis (without apical periodontitis group). the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified, and the high-throughput pyrosequencing was performed. the composition and structure characteristic of intraradicular microbiome were revealed by bioinformatic analysis. results: total sequences were taxonomically classified into 132 species-level bacteria belonging to 96 genera and 21 phyla. the most representive phyla in apical periodontitis group were firmicutes [32% (18 534/58 688)], proteobacteria [27% (15 626/58 688)], actinobacteria [15% (8 685/58 688)], bacteroidetes [11% (6163/58 688)], fusobacteria [8% (4761/58688)] and spirochaetes [3% (1 785/58 688)]. while the most representive phyla in without apical periodontitis group were firmicutes [31% (16 941/55 480)], proteobacteria  [27% (14 748/55 480)], bacteroidetes [18% (9 948/55 480)], fusobacteria [10% (5 307/55 480)], actinobacteria [9% (4 761/55 480)], chloroflexi [3% (1 785/55 480)]. the abundance of actinobacteria in apical periodontitis group was significantly higher than without apical periodontitis group (p < 0.01). the detection rates of actinomycetes in apical periodontitis group and without apical periodontitis group were 100% and 50%. conclusions: the diversity of intraradicular bacterial community in teeth with apical periodontitis was higher  than those without apical periodontitis. actinomycetes may be related to post-treatment periapical periodontitis.

TI  == identification of the microbiota in carious dentin lesions using 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == while mutans streptococci have long been assumed to be the specific pathogen responsible for human dental caries, the concept of a complex dental caries-associated microbiota has received significant attention in recent years.  molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of lactobacillus and prevotella in carious dentine lesions. however, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. in the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16s rrna gene. carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4-76 years, and the 16s rrna genes, amplified from the extracted dna with universal primers,  were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. the bacterial composition was classified into clusters i, ii, and iii according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of lactobacillus. the bacterial composition in cluster ii was composed of relatively high proportions of olsenella and propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. the bacterial communities in cluster iii were characterized by the predominance of atopobium, prevotella, or propionibacterium with streptococcus or actinomyces. some samples in clusters ii and iii, mainly related to atopobium and propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the japanese population. clone library analysis revealed that atopobium sp. hot-416 and p. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a japanese population. we summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious  lesions in a japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical japanese types with atopobium or propionibacterium predominating.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes identify distinct periodontitis phenotypes.
AB  == the currently recognized principal forms of periodontitis-chronic and aggressive-lack an unequivocal, pathobiology-based foundation. we explored whether gingival tissue transcriptomes can serve as the basis for an alternative  classification of periodontitis. we used cross-sectional whole-genome gene expression data from 241 gingival tissue biopsies obtained from sites with periodontal pathology in 120 systemically healthy nonsmokers with periodontitis,  with available data on clinical periodontal status, subgingival microbial profiles, and serum igg antibodies to periodontal microbiota. adjusted model-based clustering of transcriptomic data using finite mixtures generated two distinct clusters of patients that did not align with the current classification  of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. differential expression profiles primarily related to cell proliferation in cluster 1 and to lymphocyte activation and unfolded protein responses in cluster 2. patients in the two clusters did not differ with respect to age but presented with distinct phenotypes (statistically  significantly different whole-mouth clinical measures of extent/severity, subgingival microbial burden by several species, and selected serum antibody responses). patients in cluster 2 showed more extensive/severe disease and were more often male. the findings suggest that distinct gene expression signatures in pathologic gingival tissues translate into phenotypic differences and can provide a basis for a novel classification.

TI  == in vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  == purpose: this in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. the role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was  also evaluated. materials and methods: the efficacy of three oral rinses, acclean, noplak and prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an mtt assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an xtt assay. results: the two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio  lm-grown organisms when compared to the prevention oral rinse. conclusion: both acclean and noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. in addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.

TI  == plaque bacterial microbiome diversity in children younger than 30 months with or  without caries prior to eruption of second primary molars.
AB  == objective: our primary objective is to phylogenetically characterize the supragingival plaque bacterial microbiome of children prior to eruption of second primary molars by pyrosequencing method for studying etiology of early childhood  caries. methods: supragingival plaque samples were collected from 10 caries children and 9 caries-free children. plaque dna was extracted, used to generate dna amplicons of the v1-v3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene, and subjected to 454-pyrosequencing. results: on average, over 22,000 sequences per sample were generated. high bacterial diversity was noted in the plaque of children with caries [170 operational taxonomical units (otu) at 3% divergence] and caries-free children (201 otu at 3% divergence) with no significant difference. a total of 8 phyla, 15 classes, 21 orders, 30 families, 41 genera and 99 species were represented. in addition, five predominant phyla (firmicute, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria) and seven genera  (leptotrichia, streptococcus, actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, neisseria,  and veillonella) constituted a majority of contents of the total microbiota, independent of the presence or absence of caries. principal component analysis (pca) presented that caries-related genera included streptococcus and veillonella; while leptotrichia, selenomonas, fusobacterium, capnocytophaga and porphyromonas were more related to the caries-free samples. neisseria and prevotella presented approximately in between. in both groups, the degree of shared organism lineages (as defined by species-level otus) among individual supragingival plaque microbiomes was minimal. conclusion: our study represented for the first time using pyrosequencing to elucidate and monitor supragingival plaque bacterial diversity at such young age with second primary molar unerrupted. distinctions were revealed between caries and caries-free microbiomes in terms of microbial community structure. we observed differences in abundance for several microbial groups between the caries and caries-free host populations, which were consistent with the ecological plaque hypothesis. our approach and findings could be extended to correlating microbiomic changes after occlusion establishment and caries treatment.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == microbial basis of oral malodor development in humans.
AB  == to better understand the microbial basis of oral malodor development in humans, we used a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design and the pyrosequencing approach to track and compare the tongue microbiota associated with oral malodor  in 29 chinese adults who underwent a consecutive three-day evaluation for the amount of h2s excreted orally. three levels of the oral malodor state (healthy, oral malodor, and severe oral malodor) were defined based on the h2s level. community structure of the tongue plaques was more sensitive to changes of malodor state than to interpersonal variations or differences in sampling times.  within each individual, the structure of microbiota was relatively stable, while  their variations were correlated with the change in the h2s level. severe oral malodor microbiota were the most conserved in community structure, whereas the healthy ones were relatively varied. oral-malodor-associated bacteria were identified. the relative abundance of leptotrichia and prevotella was positively  correlated with oral malodor severity, whereas hemophilus and gemella exhibited a negative relationship with oral malodor severity. our study provides one of the first landscapes of oral microbiota changes associated with oral malodor development and reveals microbes potentially useful to the evaluation and control of oral malodor.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == characterization of oral bacterial diversity of irradiated patients by high-throughput sequencing.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the compositional profiles and microbial shifts of oral microbiota during head-and-neck radiotherapy. bioinformatic analysis based on 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing was performed to assess the diversity and variation of oral microbiota of irradiated patients. eight patients with head and neck cancers were involved in this study. for each patient, supragingival plaque samples were collected at seven time points before  and during radiotherapy. a total of 147,232 qualified sequences were obtained through pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis, representing 3,460 species level operational taxonomic units (otus) and 140 genus level taxa. temporal variations were observed across different time points and supported by cluster analysis based on weighted unifrac metrics. moreover, the low evenness of oral microbial communities in relative abundance was revealed by lorenz curves. this study contributed to a better understanding of the detailed characterization of oral bacterial diversity of irradiated patients.

TI  == exploring the dynamic core microbiome of plaque microbiota during head-and-neck radiotherapy using pyrosequencing.
AB  == radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality used for patients with head-and-neck cancers, but inevitably causes microorganism-related oral complications. this study aims to explore the dynamic core microbiome of oral microbiota in supragingival plaque during the course of head-and-neck radiotherapy. eight subjects aged 26 to 70 were recruited. dental plaque samples  were collected (over seven sampling time points for each patient) before and during radiotherapy. the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes  were amplified, and the high-throughput pyrosequencing was performed. a total of  140 genera belonging to 13 phyla were found. four phyla (actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria) and 11 genera (streptococcus, actinomyces, veillonella, capnocytophaga, derxia, neisseria, rothia, prevotella,  granulicatella, luteococcus, and gemella) were found in all subjects, supporting  the concept of a core microbiome. temporal variation of these major cores in relative abundance were observed, as well as a negative correlation between the number of otus and radiation dose. moreover, an optimized conceptual framework was proposed for defining a dynamic core microbiome in extreme conditions such as radiotherapy. this study presents a theoretical foundation for exploring a core microbiome of communities from time series data, and may help predict community responses to perturbation as caused by exposure to ionizing radiation.

TI  == identification of organic acids in cichorium intybus inhibiting virulence-related properties of oral pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the low molecular mass (lmm) extract of cichorium intybus var. silvestre (red chicory) has been shown to inhibit virulence-linked properties of oral pathogens  including streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii and prevotella intermedia. in the present study hplc-dad-esi/ms(2) was used to investigate the compounds contained in this extract for their anti-virulence activity. the extract contained a number of components, including oxalic, succinic, shikimic and quinic acids, which interfere with the growth and virulence traits (i.e., biofilm formation, adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite) of oral pathogens involved in gingivitis and tooth decay. succinic and quinic acid seem to be the most potent, mainly by interfering with the ability of oral pathogens to form biofilms (either through inhibition of their development or promotion of their disruption). our findings suggest that one or more of these compounds may modulate plaque formation in vivo, which is a prerequisite for the development of both caries and gingivitis.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

TI  == bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to evaluate the bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes using of two 16s rrna gene libraries. each library was composed of samples from patients with different averages of the differentiated silness-loe biofilm index: the first library (a) with an index between 1.0 and 3.0 (considered a high index) and the second library (b) between 0 and 0.5 (considered a low index). saliva dna was extracted  and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and cloned. the obtained sequences were compared with those stored at ncbi and rdp genbank. the saliva of patients with high index presented five known genera - streptococcus, granulicatella, gemella,  veillonella and peptostreptococcus - and 33.3% of nonculturable bacteria grouped  into 23 operational taxonomic units (otus). the saliva of patients with low index differed significantly from the first library (p=0.000) and was composed of 42 otus distributed into 11 known genera - streptococcus, granulicatella, gemella, veillonella, oribacterium, haemophilus, escherichia, neisseria, prevotella, capnocytophaga, actinomyces - including 24.87% of nonculturable bacteria. it was  possible to conclude that there is greater bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with low dental plaque in relation to patients with high dental plaque.

TI  == bacterial flora of dental periradicular lesions analyzed by the 454-pyrosequencing technology.
AB  == introduction: symptomatic teeth with periradicular lesions of infectious origin remain a significant challenge in dentistry, and the reason for the acute perturbation is incompletely understood. the present study used pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes to characterize the microbiota of periradicular lesions. methods: thirteen periradicular lesions from 11 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic teeth were sampled during apical surgery. samples  were subjected to dna extraction and 16s rrna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. pcr amplicons were then sequenced by using the roche 454 gs flx platform. data were analyzed with the quantitative insights into microbial ecology (qiime) software package. results: seven of the 13 periradicular lesions  (53.8%) yielded pcr amplicons, which generated 35,731 high-quality dna sequences  belonging to 10 bacterial phyla and 73 bacterial genera. all 7 lesions were associated with symptoms. the phyla with most bacterial taxa were proteobacteria  (proportion of total bacterial taxa, 33.3%), firmicutes (30.9%), actinobacteria (12.2%), and bacteroidetes (11.4%). the most abundant genera were fusobacterium (average of total sequences, 21.0%), streptococcus (8.0%), prevotella (7.5%), corynebacterium (7.2%), porphyromonas (6.0%). and actinomyces (5.8%). conclusions: this study demonstrated that the microbiota of symptomatic periapical lesions is predominated by anaerobic bacteria but also contains substantial levels of streptococci, actinomyces, and bacteria not previously identified in the oral cavity. the etiopathogenic role and therapeutic implication of periradicular bacteria need to be determined.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial effect of modified 3-mix paste versus ultrapex over anaerobic microorganisms from infected root canals of primary teeth: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of a modified 3-mix paste and to compare it with an iodoform paste (ultrapex) against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from root canals of infected or necrotic primary teeth. study design: an in vitro experimental assay was performed over isolated and identified anaerobic microorganisms of 21 samples, in order to compare the antimicrobial ability of both root canal filling materials,  using a disc-diffusion method. results: a total of 21 microbial samples (15 polymicrobial and 6 monomicrobial) were obtained, from which 19 different strains were identified. modified 3-mix paste showed an excellent antimicrobial effect against most of both kinds of microbial samples, although some of them exhibited  resistance; on the other hand, ultrapex showed only minimal antimicrobial ability (null or low categories). clostridium ramosum exhibited the most resistance to both materials. conclusion: the bactericidal effect of the modified 3-mix paste was superior to ultrapex, with a statistically significant difference, against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from infected root canals of primary teeth.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == strain-specific colonization patterns and serum modulation of multi-species oral  biofilm development.
AB  == periodontitis results from an ecological shift in the composition of subgingival  biofilms. subgingival community maturation is modulated by inter-organismal interactions and the relationship of communities with the host. in an effort to better understand this process, we evaluated biofilm formation, with oral commensal species, by three strains of the subgingivally prevalent microorganism  fusobacterium nucleatum and four strains of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas  gingivalis. we also tested the effect of serum, which resembles gingival exudates, on subgingival biofilms. biofilms were allowed to develop in flow cells using salivary medium. we found that although not all strains of f. nucleatum were able to grow in mono-species biofilms, forming a community with health-associated partners actinomyces oris and veillonella parvula promoted biofilm growth of all f. nucleatum strains. strains of p. gingivalis also showed  variable ability to form mono-species biofilms. p. gingivalis w50 and w83 did not form biofilms, while atcc 33277 and 381 formed biofilm structures, but only strain atcc 33277 grew over time. unlike the enhanced growth of f. nucleatum with the two health-associated species, no strain of p. gingivalis grew in three-species communities with a. oris and v. parvula. however, addition of f. nucleatum facilitated growth of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 with health-associated partners. importantly, serum negatively affected the adhesion of f. nucleatum, while it favored biofilm growth by p. gingivalis. this work highlights strain specificity in subgingival biofilm formation. environmental factors such as serum alter the colonization patterns of oral microorganisms and could impact subgingival biofilms by selectively promoting pathogenic species.

TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == [solitary actinomycotic brain abscess: case report].
AB  == actinomycotic brain abscess is a rare condition with uncertain clinical features. here we report the case of a 66-year-old immune-competent woman with an actinomycotic brain abscess who presented with sensory aphasia and mild right hemiparesis. she had no febrile episode or headache. moreover, she did not have any periodontal or oto-rhino-laryngological disease, and the results of laboratory tests were normal. a computed tomography scan showed an irregular, low-density area in the left parietal lobe. subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed low-signal intensity in a t1 weighted image, high-signal intensity in a t2 weighted image, and mixed intensity on a diffusion weighted image. thallium-201 chloride scintigraphy showed definite accumulation of thallium in the lesion and  the patient's condition gradually deteriorated. ten days after gadolinium administration, a t1 weighted image showed a multi- lobulated irregular mass in the left parietal lobe. the patient subsequently underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the yellowish abscess. gram staining of the tissue showed the presence of gram-positive filamentous rods, and abscess cultures were positive for actinomyces and prevotella disiens. the abscess resolved after treatment with a high dose of intravenous penicillin g (24 million units/day) for 8 weeks, followed by an oral dose of amoxicillin for 4 months. the patient was discharged  with a rudimentary limitation of the visual field.

AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

AB  == introduction: procedural accidents have a negative effect on healing and might contribute to the persistence of infections in inaccessible apical areas, requiring surgical intervention. this report describes a case of persistent apical periodontitis of a lower left first molar associated with the sinus tract  and a periapical lesion that required nonsurgical endodontic retreatment and apical surgery for resolution. methods: the tooth had received endodontic treatment 3 years ago and had to be retreated using the crown-down technique with chemical auxiliary substance (2% chlorhexidine gel), foramen patency, and enlargement and was filled in a single appointment. the occlusal access cavity was immediately restored with composite resin. after 1 month, it could be observed that the sinus tract persisted and, radiographically, the lesion remained unaltered. therefore, endodontic microsurgery was indicated. apical microsurgery was performed under magnification with the use of a dental operating microscope including apicectomy, root end with ultrasound, and sealing with mineral trioxide aggregate. a microbiological sample was collected from the apical lesion. the resected distal root apex was observed by scanning electron microscopy. results: the following species were detected: actinomyces naeslundii  and actinomyces meyeri, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium botullinum, parvimonas micra, and bacteroides ureolyticus; scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed bacterial biofilm surrounding the apical foramen and external radicular surface. gutta-percha overfilling at the apex because of a zip caused during initial endodontic treatment could be observed. a 6-month follow-up showed apparent radiographic periapical healing, which progressed after 24 months. conclusion: gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and extraradicular biofilm seem to participate in the maintenance of persistent periapical pathology, and endodontic retreatment followed by periapical microsurgery proved to be a successful alternative in the resolution of persistent extraradicular infections.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == effects of fruit and vegetable low molecular mass fractions on gene expression in gingival cells challenged with prevotella intermedia and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == low molecular mass (lmm) fractions obtained from extracts of raspberry, red chicory, and shiitake mushrooms have been shown to be an useful source of specific antibacterial, antiadhesion/coaggregation, and antibiofilm agent(s) that might be used for protection towards caries and gingivitis. in this paper, the effects of such lmm fractions on human gingival kb cells exposed to the periodontal pathogens prevotella intermedia and actinomyces naeslundii were evaluated. expression of cytokeratin 18 (ck18) and beta4 integrin (beta4int) genes, that are involved in cell proliferation/differentiation and adhesion, and  of the antimicrobial peptide beta2 defensin (hbetad2) in kb cells was increased upon exposure to either live or heat-killed bacteria. all lmm fractions tested prevented or reduced the induction of gene expression by p. intermedia and a. naeslundii depending on the experimental conditions. overall, the results suggested that lmm fractions could modulate the effects of bacteria associated with periodontal disease in gingival cells.

TI  == microbiological aspects of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.
AB  == clinical, microbiological, and biochemical features of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants exhibiting peri-implantitis were compared with those experiencing long-term peri-implant health. after evaluation of clinical parameters, submucosal plaque samples were obtained from permucosal implant abutment posts exhibiting probing depths >/=5 mm and bleeding on probing in subjects with peri-implantitis (n = 3) and from posts with peri-implant health in subjects with long-term subperiosteal implant health (n = 8). the microbial specimens were transported in vmga iii and plated onto enriched brucella blood agar and hammond's selective medium with anaerobic incubation, and onto selective tsbv with 5% co2 incubation. total anaerobic viable counts and selected bacterial species were identified using established phenotypic methods and criteria. in vitro resistance to doxycycline (2 mug/ml), amoxicillin (2 mug/ml), or metronidazole (4 mug/ml) was recorded per subject when bacterial pathogen growth  was noted on antibiotic-supplemented isolation plates. interleukin (il)-1beta levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peri-implant crevicular fluid samples from 5 study subjects. significantly higher plaque index scores, higher total anaerobic viable counts, more red complex species, and lower proportions of gram-positive facultative viridans streptococci and actinomyces species were detected on peri-implantitis-affected subperiosteal implants as compared with subperiosteal implants with long-term peri-implant health. no in vitro resistance to the 3 test antibiotic breakpoint concentrations studied was found, except a fusobacterium nucleatum strain resistant to doxycycline at 2 mug/ml from 1 peri-implantitis subject. subperiosteal implants with peri-implantitis tended to yield higher peri-implant crevicular fluid il-1beta levels. the level of peri-implant supramucosal plaque control and the composition of the peri-implant submucosal microbiome may be important determinants of the long-term clinical status of mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == aim: to monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. materials  and methods: supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28  teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: the total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. supragingival counts of veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. subgingival counts were greater  for actinomyces, green and orange complex species. significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0  at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. conclusions: supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked  in periodontitis.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

AB  == this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit  the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the  ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the  triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant  differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices  (p > 0.5).

TI  == defining the healthy "core microbiome" of oral microbial communities.
AB  == background: most studies examining the commensal human oral microbiome are focused on disease or are limited in methodology. in order to diagnose and treat  diseases at an early and reversible stage an in-depth definition of health is indispensible. the aim of this study therefore was to define the healthy oral microbiome using recent advances in sequencing technology (454 pyrosequencing). results: we sampled and sequenced microbiomes from several intraoral niches (dental surfaces, cheek, hard palate, tongue and saliva) in three healthy individuals. within an individual oral cavity, we found over 3600 unique sequences, over 500 different otus or "species-level" phylotypes (sequences that  clustered at 3% genetic difference) and 88 - 104 higher taxa (genus or more inclusive taxon). the predominant taxa belonged to firmicutes (genus streptococcus, family veillonellaceae, genus granulicatella), proteobacteria (genus neisseria, haemophilus), actinobacteria (genus corynebacterium, rothia, actinomyces), bacteroidetes (genus prevotella, capnocytophaga, porphyromonas) and fusobacteria (genus fusobacterium).each individual sample harboured on average 266 "species-level" phylotypes (sd 67; range 123 - 326) with cheek samples being  the least diverse and the dental samples from approximal surfaces showing the highest diversity. principal component analysis discriminated the profiles of the samples originating from shedding surfaces (mucosa of tongue, cheek and palate) from the samples that were obtained from solid surfaces (teeth).there was a large overlap in the higher taxa, "species-level" phylotypes and unique sequences among the three microbiomes: 84% of the higher taxa, 75% of the otus and 65% of the unique sequences were present in at least two of the three microbiomes. the three individuals shared 1660 of 6315 unique sequences. these 1660 sequences (the "core microbiome") contributed 66% of the reads. the overlapping otus contributed to 94% of the reads, while nearly all reads (99.8%) belonged to the shared higher taxa. conclusions: we obtained the first insight into the diversity and uniqueness of individual oral microbiomes at a resolution of next-generation sequencing. we showed that a major proportion of bacterial sequences of unrelated healthy individuals is identical, supporting the concept of a core microbiome at  health.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == assessment of intraradicular bacterial composition by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to assess the bacterial community structures associated with endodontic infections using terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism (t-rflp), and to investigate the correlation of whole community profiles with the manifestation of particular clinical features. methods: intraradicular samples were collected from 34 subjects and classified into three  study groups based on the observed clinical symptoms: acute (n = 16), sub-acute (n = 8), and asymptomatic (n = 10). genomic dna was extracted from each sample, submitted to polymerase chain reaction using a fluorescently labeled 16s ribosomal dna forward primer, and digested with two tetrameric endonucleases (hhai and mspi). the terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) were subsequently discriminated in an automated dna sequencer, and the results were filtered using  a statistics-based criterion. results: totals of 138 (hhai) and 145 (mspi) unique t-rfs were detected (means 13.1 and 11.9) and there was high inter-subject variability in the bacterial assemblages. odds-ratio analysis unveiled the existence of higher order groups of positively associated t-rfs, restating the concept that intricate ecological relationships may take place in the root canal  space. a significantly greater t-rf prevalence was detected in acute cases, suggesting a straight correlation between species richness and spontaneous pain.  conclusion: overall, no t-rflp profile representing a specific bacterial consortium could be associated with the manifestation of symptoms of endodontic origin.

TI  == bacterial and host interactions of oral streptococci.
AB  == the oral microbial flora comprises one of the most diverse human-associated biofilms. its development is heavily influenced by oral streptococci, which are considered the main group of early colonizers. their initial attachment determines the composition of later colonizers in the oral biofilm and impacts the health or disease status of the host. thus, the role of streptococci in the development of oral diseases is best described in the context of bacterial ecology, which itself is further influenced by interactions with host epithelial  cells, the immune system, and salivary components. the tractability of the oral biofilm makes it an excellent model system for studies of complex, biofilm-associated polymicrobial diseases. using this system, numerous cooperative and antagonistic bacterial interactions have been demonstrated to occur within the community and with the host. in this review, several recent identified interactions are presented.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. materials and methods: biofilms of six bacterial species (streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs according to the zurich biofilm model. xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. at the end of their designated incubation times, some ha discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific  media. after a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. results: clsm images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of ha discs. culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. conclusions: xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. this study shows that xylitol is not  only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance  of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.

TI  == zinc and copper play a role in coaggregation inhibiting action of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aim: we investigated the mechanisms of adherence of salivary and serum proteins, which mimic gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), to porphyromonas gingivalis, and the effects of these adhered proteins on coaggregation and hemagglutination properties. methods: the amounts of salivary and serum proteins  adhering to p. gingivalis were determined using (3)h-labeled and non-labeled proteins. the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and streptococcus oralis or streptococcus gordonii was observed. hemagglutination was evaluated using sheep erythrocytes. proteins that interacted with zinc or copper in saliva and serum and on p. gingivalis were examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results: the amount of salivary or serum proteins that adhered to the surface of p. gingivalis strains was increased by cations, especially zinc and copper ions. the pretreatment of bacterial cells with salivary or serum proteins before the assay inhibited coaggregation with gram-positive bacteria and hemagglutination. these phenomena were enhanced by the presence of zinc or copper ions during the pretreatment of p. gingivalis with proteins. we detected protein bands that were related to these cations in saliva  and serum and on p. gingivalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that zinc and copper ions markedly enhanced the adhesion and accumulation of salivary and serum proteins on cells of p. gingivalis and inhibited the coaggregation and hemagglutination of p. gingivalis. these cations might be useful for limiting the settlement of p. gingivalis in the gingival sulcus with the goal of preventing periodontal disease.

TI  == similarities in the subgingival microbiota assessed by a curet sampling method at sites with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. methods: subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (pd) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966  subgingival sites). subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method identifying 37 species. results: probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and  16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. statistical analysis failed to demonstrate  differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (p = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (p = 0.78). with the exceptions of campylobacter gracilis  (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. a trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for prevotella nigrescens (p <0.01). at a  cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. conclusions: given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. this may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm of subjects with healthy and diseased implants.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to compare the microbial composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm in subjects with and without peri-implantitis. material and methods: forty-four subjects (mean age 48.9 +/- 13.51 years) with at least one implant restored and functional for at least 2 years were assigned to two groups: a peri-implantitis group (n=22), consisting of subjects presenting peri-implant sites with radiographic defects >3 mm, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration; and a control group (n=22), consisting of subjects with healthy implants. the clinical parameters evaluated were plaque index, gingival bleeding, bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing depth and clinical attachment level. supra- and subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of each  implant and analyzed for the presence of 36 microorganisms by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were observed in the peri-implantitis group, both supra- and subgingivally (p<0.05). the proportions of the pathogens from the red complex were elevated, while host-compatible beneficial microbial complexes were reduced in diseased compared with healthy implants. the microbiological profiles of supra- and subgingival environments did not differ substantially within each group. conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of supra- and subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis was comprised  of more periodontal pathogenic bacterial species, including the supragingival biofilm.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by maldi-tof-ms.
AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == effect of calcium glycerophosphate on demineralization in an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  == the aim was to investigate the anti-caries properties of calcium glycerophosphate (cagp) using an in vitro bacterial flow cell model. four flow cells, inoculated from a chemostat containing a seven-organism bacterial consortium, were pulsed with sucrose twice daily, to provide an acidic challenge and ph-cycling conditions. blocks of enamel and dentine were mounted in each flow cell. in a study on the effect of cagp concentration, cagp was pulsed into three of the flow cells, at the same time as the sucrose, to give concentrations of 0.10, 0.25 and  0.50%. water was pulsed into the fourth flow cell with the sucrose. microradiography revealed a significant dose response of decreasing demineralization as cagp concentration increased. reductions at 0.25 and 0.5% were significant when compared to the control. a second study investigated the effect of timing of cagp pulsing, relative to sucrose, on enamel and dentine demineralization. cagp (flow cell concentration 0.2%), was pulsed 1 h before, during or 1 h after the sucrose pulse; a water control was employed. in enamel, pulsing cagp before the sucrose reduced demineralization significantly compared to concurrent pulsing, which in turn gave a significant reduction compared to pulsing after sucrose, which did not reduce demineralization significantly compared to the water control. in dentine, cagp reduced demineralization significantly only when pulsed before the sucrose. the findings suggest that in vivo, the anti-caries potential of cagp may be greater if it is applied before a  cariogenic challenge.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == survey of oral microbial diversity using pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == polymicrobial biofilms in the human oral cavity exhibit marked diversity. pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) surveys microbial diversity by displaying pcr-generated 16s rdna fragments that migrate at different distances, reflecting the differences in the base-pair (i.e., % g+c) composition of the fragment. this study examined dgge-generated diversity profiles of cultivable bacteria from individuals with different caries status. initially, we developed a set of pcr-dgge running conditions appropriate to oral  bacteria. next, we assessed migration standards from known oral bacterial reference strains. to test the methods, we profiled 20 bacterial saliva samples cultivated from young adults. the study produced a battery of species-specific 16s rdna amplicons that could be used as a migration distance standard necessary  for computer-assisted profile analysis. from the clinical samples, we found a significantly greater diversity of oral microbes in caries-free individuals compared with caries-active individuals (p = 0.01). these findings suggest thtat  a portion of oral microbiota of caries-active individuals may be absent, suppressed, or replaced.

TI  == scaling and root planing, systemic metronidazole and professional plaque removal  in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a brazilian population ii--microbiological results.
AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == roles of arg- and lys-gingipains in coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis: identification of its responsible molecules in translation products of rgpa, kgp, and haga genes.
AB  == arg- (rgp) and lys-gingipains (kgp) are two individual cysteine proteinases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis , an oral anaerobic bacterium, and are implicated as major virulence factors in a wide range of pathologies of adult periodontitis. coaggregation of this bacterium with other oral bacteria is an initial and critical step in infectious processes, yet the factors and mechanisms responsible for this process remain elusive. here we show that the initial translation products of the rgpa , kgp and hemagglutinin haga genes are responsible for coaggregation of p. gingivalis and that the proteolytic activity  of rgp and kgp is indispensable in this process. the rgpa rgpb kgp- and rgpa kgp  haga -deficient triple mutants exhibited no coaggregation activity with actinomyces viscosus , whereas the kgp -null and rgpa rgpb -deficient double mutants significantly retained this activity. consistently, the combined action of rgp- and kgp-specific inhibitors strongly inhibited the coaggregation activity of the bacterium, although single use of rgp- or kgp-specific inhibitor significantly retained this activity. we also demonstrate that the 47- and 43-kda proteins produced from the translation products of the rgpa , kgp , and haga genes by proteolytic activity of both rgp and kgp are responsible for the coaggregation of p. gingivalis.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261.
AB  == aims: to characterize the antimicrobial activity produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261, and to evaluate its safety on cultured gingival fibroblasts. methods and results: an antimicrobial activity was obtained from purifying the culture supernatant of pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. purification of the active compound was achieved with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. as revealed by sds-page, the active fraction was relatively homogeneous, showing a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 41 kda. the antimicrobial compound, named nigrescin, exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and actinomyces spp. nigrescin was stable in a ph range between 6.5 and 9.5, at 100 degrees c for 10 min, and resistant to lyophilization. but its activity was lost after proteinase k treatment. despite at very high concentrations beyond the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), nigrescin was not toxic to the gingival fibroblasts. conclusion: nigrescin is a novel bacteriocin produced by pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. it exhibits antimicrobial activity against species that are implicated in  periodontal diseases. the absence of toxicity on the gingival fibroblasts suggests the possibility in using of nigrescin for an application in periodontal  treatment. significance and impact of the study: novel evidence on nigrescin would make pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 attractive in biotechnological applications  as an antimicrobial agent in clinical dentistry.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == comparison of type 1 and type 2 cytokine production by mononuclear cells cultured with streptococcus mutans and selected other caries bacteria.
AB  == a feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mrna  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. these results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (lactobacillus casei, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and prevotella intermedia). all isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. s. mutans was the most potent  and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with l. casei the dominant producer. s. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. p. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. a similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by l. casei, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. a better understanding of  pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.

TI  == effects of periodontitis and smoking on the microbiota of oral mucous membranes and saliva in systemically healthy subjects.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the differences in the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from eight oral soft-tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects with and without periodontitis and in smokers and nonsmokers. methods: saliva and microbial samples were taken from eight oral  soft-tissue surfaces in 229 systemically healthy subjects stratified by periodontal and smoking status. subjects included 84 periodontally healthy and 145 periodontitis individuals. of these, there were 182 nonsmokers and 47 smokers. soft-tissue samples were taken using a "buccal brush" and saliva was taken by expectoration. all samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species at each sample location  and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in these populations using the kruskall-wallis test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: when stratified for periodontal status or smoking status, microbial profiles at most sites did not differ significantly. generally, periodontal pathogens were found at higher levels on the soft tissues of periodontitis subjects than in periodontally healthy subjects, and at higher levels in smokers than nonsmokers. few significant differences were found, although trends in the populations were noted. conclusions: small differences in  the proportions of bacterial species were observed on soft tissues and in saliva  comparing periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects. somewhat greater differences between smokers and nonsmokers were found; however, these were not statistically significant.

TI  == differential cytokine induction by two types of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis with type ii fima is strongly associated with adult periodontitis. however, the importance of specific fima types in the immune response is unknown. two types of p. gingivalis (type i and type ii) and actinomyces naeslundii were assessed for their degree of cytokine induction in the macrophage-like human cell line u937. real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine mrna expression of 12 cytokines.  significant levels of interleukin (il)-8 induction and a similar cytokine expression pattern were observed at 6 h postinfection for all three bacterial strains. however, type ii p. gingivalis infection showed statistically higher levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mrna induction than those of control at 24 h postinfection, whereas type i p. gingivalis and a.  naeslundii showed no significant induction of these cytokines. these data suggest that compared with a. naeslundii and type i p. gingivalis, type ii p. gingivalis  prolongs the cytokine response. although other factors may also be involved, the  sustained cytokine response induced by type ii p. gingivalis may play an important role in enhanced periodontal tissue inflammation and destruction.

TI  == bacterial colonization during de novo plaque formation.
AB  == objective: to determine microbial changes that occur during plaque formation in a dentition free of gingival inflammation. material and methods: ten subjects were  recruited. the study included one preparatory period (2 weeks) and a plaque accumulation period (4 days). the volunteers exercised proper tooth cleaning methods, were scaled and received repeated professional mechanical tooth cleaning during the preparatory period. during the plaque accumulation period, the participants abstained from plaque control measures. plaque was scored on the approximal surfaces of maxillary and mandibular premolars on days 0, 1, 2 and 4 using a scale from 0 to 5 and according to the criteria of the quigley and hein plaque index (qhi). supragingival plaque samples were obtained from the same intervals and surfaces and evaluated using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the mean qhi increased from 0 to 1.6 (day 4). the total number of organisms on day 0 averaged 140 x 10(5) and increased to about 210 x 10(5) after 4 days without oral hygiene. the most dominant species on day 0 were  members of the genus actinomyces. these organisms comprised almost 50% of the microbiota evaluated. none of the actinomyces species increased significantly during the 4 days. some streptococcus species increased significantly over time as well as species of the genera capnocytophaga, campylobacter, fusobacteria and  actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: in the present investigation, the  preparatory phase established a situation with minimal gingival inflammation and  close to zero amounts of dental plaque. the day 0 plaque samples exhibited high proportions of actinomyces species. during the 4 days of no oral hygiene, there was a small increase in total numbers of organisms as well as a modest increase in the proportion of "disease-associated" taxa such as species of the "orange complex" species.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == photodestruction of human dental plaque bacteria: enhancement of the photodynamic effect by photomechanical waves in an oral biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: periodontal disease results from the accumulation of subgingival bacterial biofilms on tooth surfaces. there is reduced susceptibility of these biofilms to antimicrobials for reasons that are not known. the goals of  this study were to investigate the photodynamic effects of a conjugate between the photosensitizer (ps) chlorin(e6) (c(e6)) and a poly-l-lysine (pl) with five lysine residues on human dental plaque bacteria as well as on biofilms of the oral species actinomyces naeslundii after their exposure to photomechanical waves (pw) generated by a laser in the presence of the conjugate. study design/materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples from 12 patients with chronic destructive periodontitis were divided in 3 groups that were incubated for 5 minutes with 5 microm c(e6) equivalent from the pl-c(e6) conjugate in the presence of fresh medium (group i), pbs (group ii), and 80% pbs/20% ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (edta) (group iii) and were exposed to red light. also, biofilms of a. naeslundii (formed on bovine enamel surfaces) were exposed to pw in the presence of 5 microm c(e6) equivalent from the pl-c(e6) conjugate and were then irradiated with red light. the penetration depth of the conjugate was measured by confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm). in both cases, after illumination serial dilutions were prepared and aliquots were spread over the surfaces of blood agar plates. survival fractions were calculated by counting bacterial colonies. results: the ps/light combination achieved almost 90% killing of human dental plaque species. in biofilms of a. naeslundii, cslm revealed that pw were sufficient to induce a 50% increase in the penetration depth of the pl-c(e6) conjugate into the biofilm. this enabled its destruction (99% killing) after photodynamic therapy (pdt). conclusions: pw-assisted photodestruction of dental plaque may be a potentially powerful tool for treatment of chronic destructive periodontal disease.

TI  == induction of suppressor cells following mucosal presentation of actinomyces viscosus in mice.
AB  == mucosal presentation of actinomyces viscosus results in antigen-specific systemic immune suppression, known as oral tolerance. the aim of the present study was to  determine the mechanism by which this oral tolerance is induced. dba/2 mice were  gastrically immunized with a. viscosus. serum, peyer's patch (pp) and spleen cells were transferred to syngeneic recipients which were then systemically challenged with the sameia. viscosus strain. to determine antigen-specificity of  cells from gastrically immunized mice, recipients which received immune spleen cells were also challenged with porphyromonas gingivalis. one week after the last systemic challenge, the delayed type hypersensitivity (dth) response was determined by footpad swelling and the level of serum igg, iga and igm antibodies to a. viscosus or p. gingivalis measured by an elisa. no suppression of dth response or of specific serum antibodies was found in recipients which received serum from gastrically immunized mice. systemic immune suppression to a. viscosus was observed in recipients which had been transferred with pp cells obtained 2 days but not 4 and 6 days after gastric immunization with a. viscosus. conversely, suppressed immune response could be seen in recipients transferred with spleen cells obtained 6 days after gastric immunization. the immune response to p. gingivalis remained unaltered in mice transferred with a. viscosus-gastrically immunized cells. the results of the present study suggest that oral tolerance induced by a. viscosus may be mediated by antigen-specific suppressor cells which originate in the pp and then migrate to the spleen.

TI  == virulence factors of porphyromonas gingivalis are modified by polyphenol oxidase  and asparaginase.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a well-adapted pathogen of the periodontal pocket distinguished by its wide array of proteolytic activities and its ability to adhere to multiple substrata in the oral cavity. microbial proteins with binding  functions (such as adhesins and enzymes) very often contain critical tyrosine residues, supported by one or more asparagines in the binding cleft. this study investigates the reduction in adhesiveness and in proteolytic activity after treating p. gingivalis with the tyrosine- and asparagine-targeting enzymes polyphenol oxidase (ppo) and asparaginase (asg). cysteine protease activity was reduced by pretreatment with both enzymes, while the trypsin-like activity was affected only by ppo. adhesion to buccal epithelial cells, laminin and fibronectin as well as hemagglutination was reduced by one or both of the enzymes. ppo, but not asg, reduced the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with actinomyces naeslundii. treatment with these enzymes might provide an alternative to traditional antimicrobial strategies.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of tetracycline fibres (tcf) as an adjunct to scaling in the treatment of generalised aggressive  periodontitis and to compare the effects with mechanical treatment only. ten patients, 24-39 years old referred for treatment to the department of preventive  dentistry, periodontology and implant biology, aristotle university of thessaloniki took part in the study. a split-mouth experimental design was used.  measurements referring to bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) were performed at 12 sites randomly selected. clinical recordings were made at baseline, 2 and 6 months, after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken for microbiological analysis using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridisation technique at baseline, immediately after treatment and at 2 and 6 months. full-mouth scaling and root planing were performed, with the exception of 2 pre-selected sites, which served as controls.  tetracycline fibres were applied in 5 pockets located in the same half mouth. analysis of clinical findings showed that mechanical instrumentation in combination with tcf application led to a greater improvement in clinical parameters than scaling and root planing only. microbial analysis showed a statistically significant greater reduction in the percentages of detection for b. forsythus, p. nigrescens and a. naeslundii genospecies ii in pockets where tetracycline fibres were applied. in conclusion, the clinical and microbiological data of the present study suggest that the adjunctive use of tcf improves the clinical response of scaling and root planing in aggressive periodontitis patients.

TI  == generation of gingival t cell lines/clones specific with porphyromonas gingivalis pulsed dendritic cells from periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives and background: it is well documented that in periodontitis lesions, most infiltrated gingival t cells are antigen-specific memory t cells. these cells play an important role as regulators and effector cells in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in this study, we used dendritic cells (dcs) as antigen-presenting cells to generate human gingival t cell lines and clones specific for porphyromonas gingivalis from periodontitis patients. methods: autologous dcs were derived from the patients' adherent monocytes using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (il)-4. lymphocytes were isolated from gingival biopsies using collagenase enzyme digestion and the number was increased by subsequent culturing in il-2-containing medium. t cells were then negatively sorted using flow cytometry, cocultured with p. gingivalis-pulsed dcs and subsequently expanded in the culture medium containing il-2. t cells were kept viable and active by periodic exposure to antigen-pulsed dcs. the specificity of the t cell lines was tested against four plaque bacteria: p. gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella  intermedia and actinomyces viscosus. the established t cell lines were then cloned. three p. gingivalis-specific t cell lines and 12 gingival t cell clones were generated. they all showed good specificity against p. gingivalis but not to other plaque bacteria. results: all t cell clones were positive for cd4 and the majority of them produced interferon gamma, but a minimal or negligible amount of il-5. conclusions: the data obtained clearly showed that monocyte-derived dcs could be used as powerful antigen-presenting cells to generate antigen-specific t cells from periodontitis tissues.

TI  == periodontal microbiota and clinical periodontal status in a rural sample in southern thailand.
AB  == we sought to determine (i) the association of subgingival bacterial profiles to clinical periodontal status in a population with limited access to dental care in thailand, and (ii) the external validity of our earlier findings from a similar study in rural china. we examined 356 subjects, 30-39 yr old and 50-59 yr old, with respect to clinical periodontal status and subgingival plaque at maximally 14 sites per subject. checkerboard hybridizations were used to analyse a total of 4343 samples. the prevalence of the 27 species investigated ranged between 87.2%  and 100%. discriminant analysis based on microbial profiles classified correctly  67.5% of all deep (> or = 5 mm) and 64.2% of all shallow sites, and 67.4% of all  subjects with and 69.3% of all subjects without > or = 3 deep pockets. high colonization by 'red complex' bacteria was four times as likely (95% confidence limits (cl) 2.5-6.6) in subjects with > or = 10 sites with attachment loss of > or = 5 mm, and 4.3 times as likely (95% cl 2.6-7.1) in subjects with > or = 30 such sites. the data confirmed (i) the ubiquitous prevalence of the bacteria investigated in subjects with no regular access to dental care; and (ii) the high odds for periodontal pathology conferred by increased levels of specific periodontal bacteria.

TI  == effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth  of plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. in view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. methods: human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (aza), cyclosporin a (csa), tacrolimus (tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (myc). pge subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for pge subset 2 (clone e2r1). the protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. a redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. in an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (a. viscosus t14v, s. oralis h1, s. mutans 10449, c. gingivalis dr2001, a. actinomycetemcomitans y4, and m. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. results: in comparison with the  controls, the pge subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with aza, and by 77.0% with csa. the protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for aza and 17.0% for myc. furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (aza 70.7%, csa 78.2%, myc 69.8%, tac 64.0%). the most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for csa at values ranging from 21.0% (s. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (a. viscosus t14v) growth inhibition. conclusions: the present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.

TI  == the microflora recovered from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 implanto-prosthetic connector.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. in 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 frialit-2 implants. the functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. after removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial  samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 prosthetic connector. the microbial plaque samples were specified on cdc-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on tsbv-agar in cfu/ml. the microbial plaque samples were dominated by actinomyces israelii (68.8%), eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (v. parvula) and 11.1% (a. israelii). the most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for p. gingivalis (11.4%) and p. micros (11.4%). no statistical significant correlation  could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the  f2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. the outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. after 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.

TI  == isotypic antibody response to plaque anaerobes in periodontal disease.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (ig)a could be more protective than igg and that there could be a relationship between  crevicular fluid-specific iga levels and the onset of periodontal disease. this study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. methods: gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). antigens were extracted from actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests to assess iga and igg levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. results: the crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of igg to the 4 microorganisms tested than  that of controls (p < 10(-6) for all comparisons). iga levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (p < 10(-7) for all comparisons). controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary iga than patients (p < 0.02 for all comparisons). conclusions: these data support the potentially protective role of specific iga directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.

TI  == bacterial colonization of zirconia ceramic surfaces: an in vitro and in vivo study.
AB  == purpose: the microbial colonization of new ceramic materials developed for abutment manufacturing was assessed. materials and methods: the materials used in these experiments were disks of 'as-fired' and 'rectified' ceramic material made  of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals stabilized with yttrium (y-tzp) and commercially pure grade 2 titanium (ti) with corresponding eluates. they were tested in vitro with the following bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and porphyromonas gingivalis. proliferation  was evaluated on plates by inhibitory halos around pits, previously inoculated with eluates obtained from the materials. bacterial adhesion on materials was quantified by spectrophotometric evaluation of the slime production by the same bacteria. moreover, early bacterial adhesion was evaluated in human volunteers and observed with sem. results: no inhibition of bacterial proliferation using eluates was observed. in vitro as-fired and rectified y-tzp showed significantly  more adherent s. mutans than did ti disks, while s. sanguis seemed to adhere easily to ti specimens. no differences were noted for actinomyces spp and p. gingivalis. in vivo y-tzp accumulated fewer bacteria than ti in terms of the total number of bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods. no differences were observed between rectified and as-fired y-tzp. discussion: overall, y-tzp accumulates fewer bacteria than ti. conclusion: y-tzp  may be considered as a promising material for abutment manufacturing.

TI  == similarity of the oral microbiota of pre-school children with that of their caregivers in a population-based study.
AB  == this study evaluated the similarity between the oral microbiota of young children and that of their adult caregivers. oral samples from children (174 dentate and 18 pre-dentate) aged 6-36 months and their caregivers in saipan were assayed using a dna probe assay. many species including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces species, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium  nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in dentate and pre-dentate children, whereas bacteroides forsythus was detected only in dentate children. a higher percentage of children were positive for the detection of an individual species if the caregiver was also positive. there were significant relative risks of species detection between dentate children and their caregivers. by logistic regression, there were significant positive associations between species detection in caregiver and in child, but not between species detection and child age or maternal education level. in conclusion, dental pathogens were detected in young, including pre-dentate, children. the microbial profiles of children were strongly associated with the microbiota of their caregivers.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == dental biofilms at healthy and inflamed gingival margins.
AB  == objectives: the increased plaque formation observed in gingival inflammation is not fully understood. receptor proteins in the dental pellicle might influence bacterial adhesion and subsequent plaque formation. the purpose of the present study was to examine proteins and microorganisms in dental biofilms, at healthy and inflamed gingival margins. material and methods: to see whether marginal inflammation affects the composition of the pellicle and the early dental plaque, samples were taken from the gingival and incisal parts of teeth in periodontally  healthy subjects, both in gingival health and during experimental gingivitis. pellicle proteins were analysed using gel-electrophoresis, immunoblotting and image analysis. bacteria were analysed by culturing and the pcr technique. results: during gingivitis, the rate of plaque formation increased significantly. the semiquantitative amounts of proteins and the numbers of bacteria varied considerably between individuals and surfaces. the amount of total and individual pellicle proteins and the total numbers of bacteria were, however, increased during gingivitis and the increase in proteins was statistically significant on the incisal parts of tooth surfaces. compared to a healthy gingiva, reduced numbers for actinomyces spp. (incisal parts only) and streptococci and increased  numbers of periodontopathogens in the 4 h dental biofilms were seen at the inflamed gingiva. conclusion: increased gingival crevicular fluid flow during gingivitis affects pellicle formation and increased plasma proteins in the pellicle may modify bacterial attachment and early dental plaque composition.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == the effects of an immediately pre-surgical chlorhexidine oral rinse on the bacterial contaminants of bone debris collected during dental implant surgery.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris that can be used in the "simultaneous augmentation" technique. although this debris is contaminated with oral bacteria, a stringent aspiration protocol has been shown to reduce the levels of contamination. chlorhexidine mouthrinse is a well-proven antibacterial rinse that has been shown to reduce infectious complications associated with dental implants. this study examined the effect of pre-operative rinsing with a 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse on the bacterial contaminants present in collected bone debris bone (cbd). twenty partially edentate patients were randomly allocated into equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector (fbc) during the insertion of two dental implants. in group  t a pre-operative chlorhexidine rinse was used, whilst in group c sterile water was used. for both groups, a stringent bone collection protocol was used. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilised for identification of the isolated microbes. thirty-nine species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular actinomyces  odontolyticus, clostridium bifermentans, prevotella intermedia, and propionibacterium propionicum. samples from group t (chlorhexidine mouthrinse) yielded significantly fewer organisms (p < 0.001) than in group c (sterile water  mouthrinse). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is to be used for the purpose of immediate simultaneous augmentation, a preoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse should be utilised in conjunction with a stringent aspiration protocol to reduce further the bacterial contamination of cbd.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the fate of microorganisms in root canals of teeth with infected pulps and periapical bone lesions with and without  the use of calcium hydroxide medication. methodology: endodontic samples were cultured and microorganisms were counted and identified in 43 teeth before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) treatment during the first visit and before (sample 3) and after (sample 4) treatment during the second visit. in the first visit teeth were instrumented and half of the teeth were filled with a thick slurry of calcium hydroxide in sterile saline. the other teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and ah-2 6 sealer. after 4 weeks the teeth with calcium-hydroxide were accessed again and after microbiological sampling they were obturated with gutta-percha and ah-26 sealer. results: the mean total colony forming unit (cfu) counts of positive samples dropped significantly as a result of canal preparation during the first visit from 1.0 x 10(6) to 1.8 x 10(3) (between samples 1 and 2) but increased to 9.3 x 10(3) in the period between the  two visits (sample 2 and 3). there was no difference in mean total cfu counts of  positive samples between the end of the first (sample 2) and the end of the second visit (sample 4). the most frequently isolated species were prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga spp.. actinomyces odontolyticus. propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus micros. conclusions: although a calcium hydroxide paste was placed in the prepared canals, the number of positive canals had increased in the period between visits. however, the number of microorganisms had only increased to 0.93% of the original number of cfu (sample 1). it is concluded that a calcium hydroxide and sterile saline slurry limits but does not totally prevent regrowth of endodontic bacteria.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == viable bacteria in root dentinal tubules of teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == two sets of teeth with apical periodontitis were collected at different geographic locations to study the identity of bacteria left in the root dentinal  tubules. root dentin of 20 of these teeth was cultured from three locations between pulp and cementum (a, b, and c). in addition dentin from eight teeth was  examined histologically. using the culturing technique bacteria were found in 77% of the dentin samples from set 1 (amsterdam) and in 87.5% of the dentin samples from set 2 (glasgow). at greater distance, in layer c, from the pulp bacteria were found in 62% (13 of 21) of the dentin samples. twenty-three percent (3 of 13) of set 1 and 25% (2 of 8) of set 2 contained >50,000 colony-forming units/mg  of dentin in layer c. in layers closer to the pulp higher numbers of anaerobic bacteria and gram-positive rods were found, as well as a larger number of bacterial species. histological sections showed bacterial penetration in dentinal tubules in 5 of 8 teeth. in the other three teeth where the colony-forming units/mg recovered was <10,000, no histological signs of tubule penetration was seen. it seems clear that, in more than half of the infected roots, bacteria are  present in the deep dentin close to the cementum and that anaerobic culturing of  dentin is more sensitive than histology to detect these bacteria.

AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of subgingival microbiota in adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis subjects.
AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. methods: the study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (ap), six localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. results: prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in ap and rpp patients, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella  corrodens were associated with ap, ljp and rpp patients. the other bacterial species, including actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp. and eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. conclusions: the data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different  periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

TI  == bacteria of asymptomatic periradicular endodontic lesions identified by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == possible inclusion of contaminant bacteria during surgery has been problematic in studies of periradicular lesions of endodontic origin. therefore, in this study,  two different surgical techniques were compared. a second problem is that some difficult to cultivate species may not be detected using bacteriological methods. molecular techniques may resolve this problem. dna-dna hybridization technology has the additional advantage that dna is not amplified. the purpose of this investigation was to determine if bacteria from periradicular endodontic lesions  could be identified using dna-dna hybridization. a full thickness intrasulcular mucoperiosteal (is) flap (n = 20) or a submarginal (sm) flap (n = 16) was reflected in patients with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. dna was extracted and incubated with 40 digoxigenin-labeled whole genomic probes. bacterial dna was detected in all 36 lesions. seven probes were negative for all lesions. in patients with sinus tract communication, in teeth lacking intact full coverage crowns, and in patients with a history of trauma 4-13 probes provided positive signals. seven probes were positive in lesions obtained by the is, but not the sm technique. two probes were in samples obtained with the sm technique, but not the is. only bacteroides forsythus and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 were present in large numbers using either the is or the sm technique. the sm flap technique, in combination with dna-dna hybridization, appeared to provide excellent data pertaining to periradicular bacteria. these results supported other studies that provide evidence of a bacterial presence and persistence in periradicular lesions.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == reduced fimbria-associated activities of porphyromonas gingivalis induced by recombinant fimbrial expression.
AB  == the adhesion properties of the recombinant fimbriae (r-fimbriae) recovered from a yh522 transformant of porphyromonas gingivalis which harbors a chimeric plasmid,  pyhf2, containing the fima gene of strain 381 were compared with those of the endogenous fima fimbriae of strain 33277. the adhesion level of the r-fimbriae to actinomyces viscosus was clearly lower than that of the endogenous fimbriae. in addition, the r-fimbriae were shown to lack some minor components detectable in the endogenous fimbriae. the plasmid pyhf2 prepared from the yh522 transformant was then transformed into six different p. gingivalis strains and the resultant pyhf2-containing strains were examined for their fimbrial expression. in spite of the presence of a considerable diversity in the expression level of the r-fimbriae among these transformants, it was evident that the strains expressing  higher levels of the r-fimbriae exhibited a greater decrease in adhesion activity to other bacteria and to oral epithelial cells, as well as in self-aggregation.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == effect of three mouthrinses, containing amine/stannous fluoride, herbal extracts  or emser salt on the growth of oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == background/aims: clinical studies have shown the efficacy of mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation and inflammation of oral tissues. the aim of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of three mouthrinses: meridol, an organic amine/ stannous fluoride solution; parodontax, containing herbal ingredients; and an 0.8 % emser salt solution, on the growth of oral bacteria and dental plaque. methods: growth of actinomyces viscosus t14v, capnocytophaga ochracea 25, c. sputigena 4, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) y4, and pooled supragingival plaque in the presence of the various mouthrinses, applied to paper discs, was tested in an agar diffusion test. in a second series of tests, the 4 bacterial strains were exposed to the agents for about 3 min to simulate rinsing, then the agent was removed, and the bacteria were inoculated into fresh nutrient  broth. after 48 h bacterial growth was measured in a spectrophotometer and compared with the controls. results: in the agar diffusion test only meridol, the organic amine/stannous fluoride-containing solution, could inhibit bacterial growth, except for a. a. y4. when the bacteria where in contact with the agents for only a few minutes these results were confirmed. neither paradontax nor emser salt inhibited the growth of the bacteria, and a. a. y4 proved to be resistant to all three agents. growth of the other three strains was inhibited by meridol 92-99% (undiluted), 85-96% (1:5) and 83-98% (1:10). conclusions: we conclude that only meridol contains ingredients capable of inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria in vitro. the efficacy of the other two mouthrinses in reducing plaque accumulation in vivo has to be explained by other mechanisms.

TI  == changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  == this study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. the final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a ca(oh)(2) compound and temporary sealing. reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. after anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. before temporary  restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. before the final excavation, which did  not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by a. naeslundii and various streptococci. in conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

AB  == background: while streptococcus mutans and actinomyces spp are considered to be major pathogenic microorganisms of root caries, their roles in the degradation of organic matrix components of human root dentin need clarification. methods: ten laboratory strains and 11 clinical isolates of mutans streptococci and actinomyces species, and positive bacterial or purified enzyme controls (porphyromonas gingivalis whole cell lysates, trypsin or clostridial collagenase) were used to establish the degradation of azocollagen (ac), insoluble type i collagen (ic) or human dentin collagen (dc) from dentin powder in two types of experiments investigating collagenolytic activity either during or after bacterial growth. ultraviolet-irradiated dentin powder and gamma-irradiated ic were used to assess the collagenolytic activity of test strains during bacterial  growth. ac, ic and acid-treated dentin powder were used to determine the collagenolytic activity of sonicated bacterial whole cells and cell-free culture  supernatants recovered from test strains after growth. hydroxyproline or spectrophotometric assays were used to analyze the level of degraded collagen. results: data from this study showed that in contrast to the positive controls, none of the laboratory strains or clinical isolates elicited significant degradation of ac, ic or dc. conclusions: results indicated that mutans streptococci and actinomyces species had no significant collagenolytic activity,  but may be involved in the root caries process through other mechanisms. in addition, proteolytic enzymes from other oral bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis or from host cells such as neutrophils may also participate in the pathogenesis of root caries.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  == forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. the subgingival plaque  samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to  other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. the results showed porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with bacteroides forsythus. peptostreptococcus sp., actinomyces sp. and prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in  the healthy subjects.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == pathogenesis of cancrum oris (noma): confounding interactions of malnutrition with infection.
AB  == this study showed that impoverished nigerian children at risk for cancrum oris (noma) had significantly reduced plasma concentrations of zinc (< 10.8 micromol/l), retinol (< 1.05 micromol/l), ascorbate (< 11 micromol/l), and the essential amino acids, with prominently increased plasma and saliva levels of free cortisol, compared with their healthy counterparts. the nutrient deficiencies, in concert with previously reported widespread viral infections (measles, herpesviruses) in the children, would impair oral mucosal immunity. we  postulate, subject to additional studies, that evolution of the oral mucosal ulcers including acute necrotizing gingivitis to noma is triggered by a consortium of microorganisms of which fusobacterium necrophorum is a key component. fusobacterium necrophorum elaborates several dermonecrotic toxic metabolites and is acquired by the impoverished children via fecal contamination  resulting from shared residential facilities with animals and very poor environmental sanitation.

TI  == isolation of fusobacterium necrophorum from cancrum oris (noma).
AB  == a study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma (cancrum oris) lesions was carried out in eight noma patients 3-15 years of age in sokoto state  in northwestern nigeria. paper point sampling and conventional anaerobic microbiologic techniques were used. fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from  87.5% of the noma lesions. oral microorganisms included prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0%, 50.0%, and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. the f. necrophorum and p. intermedia isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity to clindamycin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and penicillin using the e-test, and all strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of p. intermedia,  which showed resistance to penicillin. the first reported isolation from human noma lesions of f. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.

TI  == preparation and characterization of an actinomyces naeslundii aggregation factor  that mediates coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == intergeneric coaggregation is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to be important in the initial bacterial colonization of the human oral cavity. actinomyces naeslundii, an early colonizer of the tooth surface, may enhance subsequent colonization by porphyromonas gingivalis which is associated with adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the a. naeslundii aggregation factor (anaf) that mediates coaggregation with p. gingivalis. anaf was isolated from a. naeslundii sonic extract (se) by gel filtration on a sephacryl s-400hr, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a hitrap octyl sepharose 4ff, and by ion exchange chromatography on a hitrap q. the specific activity increased 12-fold with a yield of 2.5%. sds-page analysis of anaf revealed a protein band of high molecular weight in excess of 200 kda. carbohydrate was detected as the only material coinciding with the protein band, indicating that the anaf was a glycoprotein. immunoblotting analysis indicated that anaf directly bound to p. gingivalis cells. anaf was sensitive to sodium metaperiodate treatment but not to heat or protease treatments. these results suggest that the anaf carbohydrate component mediated coaggregation with p. gingivalis cells. anaf also inhibited coaggregation with other periodontal disease-associated bacteria such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, but not  streptococci.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == microbiota of health, gingivitis, and initial periodontitis.
AB  == this study compared the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health, gingivitis  and initial periodontitis using predominant culture and a dna probe, checkerboard hybridization method. 56 healthy adult subjects with minimal periodontal attachment loss were clinically monitored at 3-month intervals for 12 months. more sites demonstrated small increments of attachment loss than attachment gain  over the monitoring period. sites, from 17 subjects, showing > or = 1.5 mm periodontal attachment loss during monitoring were sampled as active lesions for  microbial analysis. twelve subjects demonstrated interproximal lesions, and 5 subjects had attachment loss at buccal sites (recession). cultural studies identified bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and selenomonas noxia as  the predominant species associated with active interproximal lesions (9 subjects), whereas actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis, were the dominant species colonizing buccal active sites. a. naeslundii, campylobacter gracilis, and b. forsythus (at lower levels than active sites) were the dominant  species cultured from gingivitis (10 subjects). health-associated species (10 subjects) included streptococcus oralis, a. naeslundii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. dna probe data identified higher mean levels of b. forsythus and c. rectus with active (7 subjects) compared to inactive periodontitis sites. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were detected infrequently. cluster analysis of the cultural microbiota grouped 8/9 active interproximal lesions in one subcluster characterized by a mostly gram-negative microbiota, including b. forsythus and c. rectus. the data suggest that b. forsythus c. rectus and s. noxia were major species characterizing sites converting from periodontal health to disease. the differences in location and microbiota of interproximal and buccal active sites suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in increased attachment loss.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

AB  == clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival delivery of 10% minocycline-loaded (mc), bioabsorbable microcapsules were examined in 15 adult periodontitis patients. patients received oral hygiene instruction 2 weeks prior  to the study. at baseline (day 0) all teeth received supragingival scaling (sc);  2 quadrants received no further treatment and 1 quadrant received subgingival scaling and root planning (srp). in the fourth quadrant, the tooth with the deepest probing sites (at least 1 site > or = 5 mm) was treated with minocycline  microcapsules. the sites were evaluated at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. clinical indices included bleeding on probing (bop), probing depths (pd), and attachment loss (al). microbiological evaluations included percent morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; cultivable anaerobic, aerobic, and black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb); and percent porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, and actinomyces viscosus by indirect immunofluorescence. in  the sc + mc group, bop, pd, and al were significantly reduced from baseline for weeks 1 to 6. bop in the sc + mc group was significantly reduced compared to the  srp group from weeks 2 to 6. in the sc + mc group the percent of spirochetes and  motile rods decreased and the percent of cocci increased after 1 week. the increased cocci and decreased motile rods were statistically greater at weeks 4 and 6 in the sc + mc group compared to the srp group. this study demonstrates that local subgingival delivery of 10% minocycline-loaded microcapsules as an adjunct to scaling results in reduction in the percent sites bleeding on probing  greater than scaling and root planning alone and induces a microbial response more favorable for periodontal health than scaling and root planing.

AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == an immunohistochemical study on the localization of porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus and actinomyces viscosus in human periodontal pockets.
AB  == the localization and distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus and actinomyces viscosus were studied in human periodontal pockets. after  obtaining voluntary consent from 9 patients, 12 teeth and their surrounding periodontal tissue with advanced adult periodontitis were extracted carefully so  as not to change the structure of the periodontal pockets. the specimens were processed into serial sections. one of the sections was stained with brown & brenn-modified gram stain to observe the distribution of bacteria. the others were stained immunohistochemically by the labelled streptavidin biotin method (lsab method) using specific rabbit antibodies against selected bacteria. some bacteria could be found within epithelial cells. p. gingivalis was found in 9/12  of the samples examined. small aggregates of p. gingivalis were scattered in all  parts of the periodontal pockets, and some of these aggregates could be seen in close contact with the epithelium. conversely, c. rectus was observed in 5/12 of  the samples examined and was predominantly located in the middle and deep pocket  zones. c. rectus tended to form large clumps in both the tooth-attached and epithelium-associated plaque area. a. viscosus was observed in 7/12 of the samples examined and was localized predominantly in the tooth-attached plaque area, especially in the shallow and middle pocket zones. although unexpected spills of unattached plaque from periodontal pockets was possible, immunohistochemical staining with species-specific antibodies was extremely sensitive and revealed the localization and the distribution of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal pockets.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of subjects with adult periodontitis who responded poorly to scaling and root planing.
AB  == in a previous report, it was shown that scaling and root planing (srp) decreased  mean pocket depth and attachment level in subjects with adult periodontitis, as well as the levels and prevalence of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. however, a subset of subjects in that study exhibited mean loss of attachment following srp. the purpose of the present investigation was to seek clinical and microbiological differences between subjects who responded well or poorly to srp. 57 subjects with adult periodontitis were treated by full-mouth srp under local anaesthetic. clinical assessments of plaque, redness, suppuration, bop, pocket depth and attachment level were made at 6 sites per tooth prior to and 3 months post-srp. attachment level measurements were repeated at each visit and differences in means between visits used to assess change. 18 subjects showed mean attachment loss 3 months post-srp (poor response group), while 39 showed mean attachment level gain (good  response group). the prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa in subgingival  plaque samples from the mesiobuccal site of each tooth (maximum 28 sites) in each subject prior to and 3 months post-srp were assessed using checker-board dna-dna  hybridization. the prevalence of each species was computed for each subject and averaged across subjects in the 2 treatment-response groups at each visit. differences between groups were sought using the mann-whitney test. there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 response groups in any clinical parameter prior to therapy. subjects in the good response group showed more attachment level gain at sites with baseline pocket depths of < 4 mm, 4-6 and > 6 mm than poor response subjects. of 40 species evaluated, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus), t. denticola, c. gracilis and c. rectus were significantly higher and more prevalent pre-therapy in the good response subjects. mean attachment level change post srp could be predicted using multiple linear regression with a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) and t. denticola as the predictor variables (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.00001). sites that gained > or = 2  mm of attachment post therapy showed a significant decrease in the counts of p. gingivalis (7.5 +/- 3.5 to 0.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)), t. denticola (8.2 +/- 3.5 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 x 10(5)) and b. forsythus (11.1 +/- 5.7 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 x 10(5)). the data of the present investigation indicate that srp is most effective in subjects and  sites with high levels of the subgingival species that this therapy affects.

TI  == antimicrobial compounds from ceanothus americanus against oral pathogens.
AB  == during the search for antimicrobial compounds from higher plant sources, a methanol extract of ceanothus americanus demonstrated antimicrobial activity against selected oral pathogens. through further bioassay-guided fractionation and purification, three triterpenes (ceanothic acid, 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid) and two flavonoids (maesopsin and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside) were identified. among these, ceanothetric acid and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside were  new compounds. ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid demonstrated growth inhibitory effect against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia with mics ranging from 42 to  625 micrograms ml-1. maesopsin, its glucoside, and 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid, were inactive below the concentration of 500 micrograms ml-1.

TI  == characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates to cell envelope and cell wall antigens from periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the immune response of the primate, macaca fascicularis, to cell envelope (cea) or cell wall (cwa) antigens of several periodontal pathogens was examined to develop a strategy to interfere with ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were parenterally immunized with cea of either porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia or a combination of cea/cwa of campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus. serum samples were taken every 2-4 weeks over a 4-month period, which included a 13-week interval with molar teeth ligated. all of the nonhuman primates in the study exhibited baseline levels of igg, igm and iga antibody to formalinized whole cells of the bacteria. these levels increased  significantly following immunization and were elevated above baseline throughout  the remainder of the experiment. the largest change in antibody responses was seen in iga antibody levels of p. gingivalis and c. rectus (42-fold above baseline), igm antibody to p. intermedia, (41-fold increase) and igg antibody to  f. nucleatum and a. viscosus (32 and 63-fold increases). moreover, the nonhuman primates exhibited differences in isotype response levels to whole microorganisms compared with the cell envelope antigens. these findings demonstrate the capacity of these nonhuman primates to produce an active immune response to microorganisms chronically colonizing the subgingival microbiota. additionally, it appears that  the bacteria may exhibit some unique differences in their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate and may contribute to the ability of the immune  responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == evidence for serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody responses in macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human igg subclasses.
AB  == this investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin g (igg) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis. we  subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of igg subclass antibody responses in m. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. the igg response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. the major igg subclass responses were igg1 and igg3, with little, though significant, responses in the igg4 and igg2 subclasses. seventy-five to 94% of the natural igg antibody in nonhuman primate sera to porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was igg1. igg2 and igg3 predominated to bacteroides fragilis, igg4 to actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to fusobacterium nucleatum. parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact p. gingivalis elicited primarily igg3 and igg4, while the post-immunization igg response to p. intermedia was largely igg1. nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from c. rectus and f. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of a. viscosus. the greatest igg antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive  with anti-human igg1 for all of these antigens except to c. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human igg2. it appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum igg subclass antibody responses. the characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability  of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

TI  == periodontal bacteria colonizing oral mucous membranes in edentulous patients wearing dental implants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the microbiota on  the oral mucosal surfaces and in the peri-implant pocket in edentulous subjects with a past history of periodontitis. twenty edentulous subjects wearing dental implants for at least one year and with a history of periodontitis participated in this study. clinical parameters were assessed (plaque, redness, swelling, peri-implant probing depth [pipd], and bleeding on probing) and microbiological samples were taken (oral mucosal surfaces, saliva, plaque, and peri-implant pocket). based on the clinical results, the group as a whole showed healthy peri-implant tissues. a mean pipd of 3.6 mm was found. a statistically significant correlation was found between the pipd and bleeding upon probing, plaque scores, redness, and swelling. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected. the subjects harboring prevotella intermedia showed presence of pipd of > or = 5 mm. all subjects harbored peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and other prevotella species. actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, pseudomonas spp., and enterobacteria were detected less frequently. three subjects showed signs of overt soft tissue inflammation. they harbored higher proportions of peptostreptococcus spp. than the other subjects. the results corroborate the suggestion that the primary source of colonization for dental implants in edentulous patients are the oral mucous membranes. the results indicate that the microbiota of subjects wearing dental implants with a past history of periodontitis are composed of bacteria associated with a healthy periodontium or gingivitis. it is suggested that elimination of the subgingival environment by extraction of all natural teeth probably initiates the disappearance of the two periodontal bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than  that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.

TI  == experimental model for porphyromonas gingivalis infection in animals.
AB  == a virulence model suitable for studying the dynamics of porphyromonas gingivalis  infection, including the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis in experimentally induced infections of multiple organs was developed using mouse and hamster. virulence of p. gingivalis strains was expressed contrastingly in subcutaneous (sc) infection  in the murine abscess model (mam) and the hamsters abscess model (ham). subcutaneous infection in the mam was characterized by a gravity abscess, spreading from the primary site of inoculation downwards, frequently erupting as  a secondary lesion. in contract, s.c. p. gingivalis infection in ham was characterized as a palpable localized abscess at the primary site of inoculation. when the semi-solid agar (ssa) was added to the mono-culture of p. gingivalis, reproducibility of infection in both models was enhanced. p. gingivalis culture supplemented with haemin, or combined with oral actinomyces viscosus had its virulence overtly enhanced and often fatal in the mam. menadione, eh reducing agents and mixture with the streptococcus or a. neaslundii did not potentiate virulence in either mode. transtracheal challenge of the lungs of hamster with p. gingivalis initiated an early pneumonitis and later sequelae of necrosis and abscess formation. also, abscess was induced by direct inoculation of p. gingivalis in the muscles, liver and testes, but did not induce intra-abdominal abscesses. in conclusion, the ham applied with the ssa procedure caused a localized p. gingivalis tissue infection with practical advantages for quantitative and qualitative studies of p. gingivalis infections. this study also demonstrates the pathogenic potential of p. gingivalis by reproducing similar infections in multiple anatomical sites.

TI  == human root caries: microbiota of a limited number of root caries lesions.
AB  == the microbiota of root caries lesions of different grades of severity were studied. fourteen lesions were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed correlation of histopathologically distinguishable stages with specific and distinct microbial populations. dentin samples were ground in a sterile mortar and cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, apizym, and api50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. in initial as well as in  advanced lesions gram-positive bacteria accounted for approximately 90% of the cfut. the proportion of actinomyces, and in particular a. naeslundii was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in initial lesions than in advanced lesions. in contrast, the percentage of streptococcus and especially s. mutans was higher (p  < 0.05) in advanced than in initial lesions. surprisingly low (0.8% of the cfut)  was the percentage of lactobacilli in advanced lesions. gram-negative bacteria formed a minor part of the microbiota in both initial and advanced lesions. among the gram-negative isolates, prevotella, selenomonas, and bacteroides spp. were most noticeable. in advanced lesions, only the outermost layer of 0.5 mm thickness was populated by a high number of bacteria; the following segments harbored a negligible number of bacteria only. it is concluded that root caries is a continuous destruction process which is restricted to a subsurface zone of limited depth. the necrotic dentin is successively worn away, leading to a saucer-shaped cavitation which is repopulated by plaque. the creation of cavitations favors an aciduric flora. this might explain the succession of bacterial populations observed during the destruction process.

AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == pathogenicity of bacteria using a simulated root canal system.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of an implantation test using teflon-simulated root canals for evaluating the pathogenicity of root  canal bacteria. models including suspensions of lyophilized strains (actinomyces  israelii, streptococcus faecalis, and porphyromonas asaccharolyticus) were implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue for 1 wk, and histological changes were observed. severe inflammation occurred around the models. among them, p. asaccharolyticus induced the severest inflammatory response. further study using  p. asaccharolyticus was conducted to compare the implantation test's ability to evaluate pathogenicity with that of an injection test at 1, 2, or 4 wk. tissue injected with a bacterial suspension showed no clear response through the experimental periods, whereas tissue around implantation sites showed a severe response at 1 wk. however, the inflammatory response subsided at later stages. consequently, further improvement is needed to investigate pathogenicity for long periods.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with an altered subgingival environment induced by periodontal pocket reduction.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of an altered subgingival environment, induced by changing the local soft tissue morphology, i.e., pocket depth reduction, on the subgingival microbiota and the clinical conditions. 7 patients aged 30-60 years with generalized marginal periodontitis were selected. patients were instructed in proper oral hygiene and all teeth were cleaned supragingivally. mucoperiosteal flaps were raised and the bone re-contoured to eliminate angular bony defects. while the control teeth were carefully debrided and thoroughly root planed, no root instrumentation was performed on the test teeth. calculus deposits visible to the naked eye were only chipped-off with the tip of a scaler. the flaps were apically repositioned and sutured at the level of the bone crest. clinical parameters showed a similar pattern of response in the test and control sites over a one year observation period post therapy. probing depths and probing attachment levels were significantly reduced one month after surgery and remained at a lower level. a significant decrease was also noted for total anaerobic viable bacterial counts.  the proportion of the gram-negative anaerobic rods decreased significantly in both groups. p. gingivalis, fusobacterium sp., c rectus were detected significantly less often after treatment in both groups. capnocytophaga and a. odontolyticus, on the other hand, were more frequently isolated after therapy. these findings corroborate the concept that the reduction of selected subgingival microorganisms is the key element for the success of periodontal therapy, rather  than the removal of tooth substance and mineralized deposits by root instrumentation.

TI  == studies into the microbial spectrum of apical periodontitis.
AB  == this study examined the variety of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacterial species recovered from cases of acute apical periodontitis. a total of 19 root canal samples and 24 periapical granuloma samples were taken from patients suffering pain and discomfort. bacteria were identified by applying the following techniques: culturing on various media, gram-staining and using commercially available biochemical test strips. in addition, prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas endodontalis were differentiated on a molecular genetic level using species-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes. the most frequently identified bacteria were prevotella intermedia, bifidobacterium spp., streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus milleri-group and bacteroides spp. obligate anaerobes occurred at a rate of 82.3%, and the average number of isolates was 6.4 per sample.

TI  == microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  == a total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. a subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. at baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2)  select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. there were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters  measured at the 7 different time points. the control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of p. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. after 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly veillonella dispar. this study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == oral microbiota in subjects with a weak or strong response in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to examine the composition of the oral microbiota in subjects who had previously demonstrated to develop either a weak or strong response to experimental gingivitis. for this study, subjects were selected from a pool of 25 individuals who had participated twice in an experimental gingivitis trial. out of these 25 panellists, 6 subjects were selected who had developed 2x a weak gingival inflammatory response and 7 subjects who had developed 2x a strong gingival inflammatory response. approximately 9 months after the 2nd experimental gingivitis trial, we evaluated  the clinical condition and the prevalence of a panel of selected oral micro-organisms in these subjects. the subjects were clinically examined for the  presence of plaque, bleeding, pocket depth and loss of attachment. for the microbiological evaluation, samples were taken from the mucous membranes, subgingival sites and saliva. samples were analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, spirochaetes and motile rods. clinical evaluation showed that most subjects had a relatively healthy periodontal condition. no clinically  significant differences could be detected between the weak and strong responding  groups. the microbial evaluation showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. micros in all subjects in either group. analysis of the microbial data for the weak and strong responding group showed no differences between the groups.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  == despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. in this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including  streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough bsa-coated ti surfaces. the smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for s. sanguis and a. viscosus. however, p. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with sem. cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both a. viscosus and p. gingivalis observed were associated with the ti surfaces. ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. the in vitro attachment system has  proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant  surfaces.

TI  == microbiological assessment of an improved stannous fluoride dentifrice.
AB  == recently, a new stabilized stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice (ssf) has been developed. the aim of the present work was to examine the antimicrobial activity  of snf2, and to assess the long-term microbial safety of this dentifrice in a series of in vitro and clinical evaluations. results of in vitro time-kill experiments with representative oral bacteria demonstrated that snf2 exerts broad antimicrobial activity against both gram-positives and gram-negatives and, in particular, has potent activity against streptococcus mutans. sixty-eight subjects participated in a nine-day plaque regrowth clinical study to assess the  short-term antiplaque effect of ssf. the results revealed no significant differences from the negative control, suggesting that snf2 does not detectably or directly alter plaque microbial viability or composition. separately, evaluation of microbial safety in a subgroup of 120 subjects participating in a six-month clinical efficacy and safety trial found no significant ecological shifts between ssf and the negative (naf dentifrice) control among 11 supragingival microbial populations examined. the potential for development of bacterial resistance to snf2 was assessed under both in vitro and clinical conditions. in a rigorous assessment of the ability of bacterial populations to develop either phenotypic or genotypic resistance to snf2, representative bacteria were exposed to continuous sub-lethal concentrations of snf2 in a laboratory chemostat for at least 9 days. results of time-kill experiments on exposed populations revealed no significant changes in susceptibility despite exposure of over 10(12) bacteria. based on typical spontaneous mutation rates of  10(-6) to 10(-8), these results suggested that the potential for bacteria to develop resistance to snf2 is low. evaluation of susceptibility to snf2 to over 800 bacterial isolates obtained over the course of the six-month clinical trial corroborate the in vitro findings, revealing no changes in susceptibility suggestive of development of resistance to snf2 is a microbiologically safe agent for oral use and support separate clinical observations demonstrating the safety  and efficacy of this stabilized snf2 dentifrice.

TI  == human root caries: microbiota in plaque covering sound, carious and arrested carious root surfaces.
AB  == the plaque microbiota covering sound or carious root surfaces were studied and compared with that covering arrested root caries lesions. from each of these categories five extracted teeth were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed us to relate the qualitative and quantitative microbial composition to the degree of integrity of the root surface. plaque was sampled by a newly developed 'mowing' technique. plaque samples were cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci of the mutans group. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, api zym, and api 50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. regardless of the state of mineralization, the microbiota on all surfaces resembled marginal plaque associated with gingivitis. in addition to the gram-positive predominant facultative anaerobic genera streptococcus, staphylococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces, gram-negative anaerobes, predominantly bacteroides, prevotella, selenomonas, fusobacterium, leptotrichia,  and capnocytophaga, showed the highest isolation frequencies. on all surfaces actinomyces spp. predominated, with streptococci and lactobacilli forming a minor part of the microbiota. with respect to the detected proportions of anaerobes, microaerophiles, actinomyces naeslundii, prevotella buccae and selenomonas dianae, significant differences were observed between the three categories of root surfaces. the total cfu's on both caries-free and caries-active surfaces were significantly higher than on arrested lesions. in general, the results support a polymicrobial etiology for caries initiation on root surfaces, with a.  naeslundii, capnocytophaga spp., and prevotella spp. making specific contributions to the processes of cementum and dentin breakdown.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == oral health status related to subgingival bacterial flora and sex hormones in saliva during pregnancy.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate oral health status in relation to subgingival microflora and sex hormone concentrations in saliva during pregnancy. oral health examinations were performed on 39 subjects: of 19 pregnant women (mean age 28.5), and 8 women in the fifth post-partum month (mean age 27.1), and  12 non-pregnant women (mean age 22.9). periodontal conditions of bleeding on probing, redness, swelling, and probing depth were examined. subgingival microbial compositions were examined with several selective media. concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in saliva were determined during pregnancy and the  first post-partum month. from the third to the fifth month of pregnancy, the number of gingival sites where probing caused bleeding increased concomitantly with increasing percentages of prevotella intermedia. the number of gingival sites with redness and swelling increased in the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy and decreased in the last month of pregnancy to the level of the second month. the gingival inflammatory signs, however, tended to increase in the first  post-partum month. the probing depth of gingiva gradually increased during pregnancy and the first post-partum month. percentage of p. intermedia increased  in the fourth month of pregnancy with increasing of hormones in saliva. the concentrations of hormones in saliva attained peaks in the ninth month of pregnancy. thereafter, proportion of p. intermedia decreased. as a further step,  these pregnant women were divided into three groups on the bases of percentages and detectable rates of p. intermedia. gingival inflammation was more extensive in the high group subjects in which more than 15% p. intermedia in total cfu was  detected; its severity also tended to increase.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == bacteria invading periapical cementum.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms invade periapical cementum of human teeth from the adjacent periapical lesions. we therefore attempted to isolate microorganisms from periapical cementum through the adoption of standard anaerobic procedures for obligate anaerobes. samples of cementum were taken from 10 amputated tooth roots at the time of apicoectomy. from two of these samples, bacteria were recovered after anaerobic incubation, but no bacteria were recovered after aerobic incubation of the same samples. of a total of eight isolates from the cementum, seven were obligate anaerobes and one was aerotolerant. the obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to the genera prevotella, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, and fusobacterium. the aerotolerant  anaerobe was campylobacter. from this, we conclude that bacteria can successfully invade cementum via periapical periodontal tissue, and that such bacteria may play a significant role in chronic periapical pathosis.

TI  == relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess in vitro migration of the following three bacterial species into dentinal tubules: streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii and prevotella intermedia. twenty-seven bovine incisors were randomly  divided into three groups. only the root dentin was used for the experiment. within each group, the nine incisors were sectioned into 36 dentin blocks that were incubated with one of the tested bacterial suspensions. twelve samples were  taken after 10, 20, and 28 days. half the samples were observed with scanning electron microscopy and the others with light microscopy after standard histologic procedures, and the depth of bacterial penetration was measured. analysis of the examinations showed that whatever the technique used, only one strain on this experimental model migrated into dentinal tubules. s. sanguis was  observed at a depth of 792 microns, but no migration was observed for either a.naeslundii or p.intermedia. the differences in migration of the bacteria tested appear to be related to their morphologic factors and cellular arrangement.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the spectrum and the antibacterial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to oral antibiotics isolated from clinical specimens was assessed in two different centres, the first receiving specimens from university departments and the second from general practitioners and small hospitals. susceptibility was studied with a microtiter ready-to-use panel system, using the manufacturer's modified wilkins-chalgren's broth as the test medium for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ampicillin+sulbactam, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, clindamycin, doxycycline and erythromycin. anaerobic bacteria frequently encountered in clinical specimens from the university departments were mainly resistant bacteroides spp., especially bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., whereas in the outpatient center, peptostreptococcus spp, actinomyces spp. and veillonella parvula (usually considered as colonizing flora) represented 90% of the cultured bacteria. the study shows that the members of most bacteroides spp.  encountered in a hospital environment are resistant to most of these agents (except clindamycin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, and ampicillin+sulbactam), whereas the gram-positive pathogens are widely covered by most of the orally available agents studied including cefetamet.

TI  == coaggregation of prevotella intermedia with oral actinomyces species.
AB  == five strains of prevotella intermedia were examined for their ability to coaggregate with various gram-positive and gram-negative species of oral bacteria. two of the p. intermedia strains coaggregated with selected actinomyces species, p. intermedia 27 with actinomyces viscosus t14v and actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104, pk606, pk984, and pk947, and p. intermedia 113 with actinomyces odontolyticus wvu 1546 and actinomyces israelii wvu 838. exposure of  both prevotella strains but not the actinomyces strains to heat, trypsin, or proteinase k abolished most coaggregations. all pairs were disaggregated by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate, but only those coaggregations involving p. intermedia 113 were reversed by the addition of 2.0 m urea. p. intermedia 27 was  sensitive to periodate oxidation, whereas the partner strains were stable to this treatment. most coaggregations occurred in the presence of saliva; however, reactions involving p. intermedia 27 were not as strong as those of buffer-suspended cells. treatment of both p. intermedia 113 coaggregations pairs  with proteinase k and the results obtained from suspensions of these pairs in saliva suggest that different surface molecules of this p. intermedia strain may  mediate each of these coaggregations. these data suggest that all of these coaggregations involve either a protein or glycoprotein on the prevotella strain, which may interact with carbohydrates or carbohydrate-containing molecules on the surface of the actinomyces strain.

TI  == the association of carious dentin microflora with tissue changes in human pulpitis.
AB  == correlations were sought between the number and type of microorganisms recovered  from sampled carious dentin and the cellular responses observed in dental pulpal  tissues from a sample of 65 vital, carious teeth extracted from adult humans who  had declined the option of tooth restoration. standardized homogenates of carious dentin were plated using selective and nonselective media under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. pulpal responses were characterized histopathologically on the basis of the nature of the cellular infiltrate and the extent of degenerative changes. a significant association between the number of prevotella intermedia and prevotella melaninogenica in carious dentin and extensive, principally mononuclear, inflammatory infiltration was evident despite a high degree of complexity and intersubject variability in the microbial flora.  there was no apparent association between other microorganisms or total microbial load and the histopathological category.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modulation of intergeneric adhesion of oral bacteria by human saliva.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis adheres in vitro to biofilms containing streptococcus and actinomyces species. on initial entry to the mouth, this interbacterial adhesion may enable p. gingivalis to colonize dental plaque and to avoid clearance by saliva flow. saliva may also interfere directly with p. gingivalis colonization of dental plaque; a 43-kda glycoprotein in human submandibular-sublingual saliva binds to p. gingivalis surfaces and diminishes interbacterial adhesion activity. to avoid fouling of its surface by host components, p. gingivalis produces surface-localized proteases that can degrade adsorbed proteins and may serve to unmask bacterial adhesins. successful management of p. gingivalis colonization might be achieved in the future by devising artificial methods to block its surface adhesins or to prevent bacterial proteolysis of native salivary molecules that have protective functions.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == correlation between thermal sensitivity and microorganisms isolated from deep carious dentin.
AB  == the correlation between thermal sensitivity and the microorganisms present in 29  deep carious lesions was studied. the numbers of lactobacilli and total gram-positive rods in the carious lesions were found to be negatively related to  the length of pain triggered by cold and heat stimulants. the presence of gram-positive cocci and non-black-pigmented bacteroides were positively associated with both cold and heat sensitivities. black-pigmented bacteroides, streptococcus mutans, and total anaerobic colony counts were positively related to the heat sensitivity. recovery of fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces viscosus, and enterics on the selective plates was associated with cold sensitivity. total counts of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods on the anaerobic nonselective medium were positively related to the cold sensitivity. it appeared that teeth with low numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded to thermal tests with longer duration of pain. conversely, teeth with high numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded  with shorter duration of pain.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == the purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (snf2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of snf2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). the antibacterial inhibitory effect of various snf2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, a. viscosus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. intermedius.  when twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent snf2 were compared  for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the snf2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). with increasing concentration of snf2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). snf2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. this in vitro study demonstrated that certain snf2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the snf2.

TI  == comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the ph responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  == comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in ph than does glucose. in vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence  of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no ph response with this sugar. this suggested that the smaller decreases in ph seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. in the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce  base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose  ph responses. these showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the ph by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. the effects were  different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. the corresponding acid-base ph profiles for pure cultures were different.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiota associated with residual clefts and neighboring teeth in patients with cleft lip, alveolus, and palate.
AB  == twenty patients with residual clefts or pronounced soft tissue grooves, treated for uni- or bilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate were included in this study. ten patients were recalled for dental prophylaxis at regular intervals, 10 patients were not. one microbiologic sample was obtained from the cleft area and  two samples from a tooth adjacent to the cleft (sites adjacent and distant to the cleft). between the recall and the nonrecall group there were notable differences in the presence of anaerobic gram-negative organisms. fusobacterium spp., prevotella melaninogenica, and p. intermedia were more often found in nonrecall patients. while rarely seen in recall patients, spirochetes and motile rods were  a common feature of nonrecall patients. the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected in either group. the differences between the recall and the nonrecall groups were more pronounced when the respective samples from teeth were related to each other than when the samples obtained from the clefts were compared. the cleft flora was less complex irrespective of how good maintenance was and resembled the flora of teeth of well-maintained patients. samples from clefts were never wolinella positive, and harbored significantly less capnocytophaga and actinomyces viscosus than samples from dental sites.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein in the aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with actinomyces viscosus cells. a 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp)-coding gene from p. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. the recombinant 40-kda omp did not show aggregation activity. however, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles with a. viscosus cells. the antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of p. gingivalis with a. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. moreover, aggregation of a. viscosus cells with p. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment  of the a. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. these findings suggest that the 40-kda omp may be an important aggregation factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == inhibition of actinomyces viscosus--porphyromonas gingivalis coadhesion by trypsin and other proteins.
AB  == protease activity is associated with the coadhesion of actinomyces viscosus and porphyromonas gingivalis. to try to distinguish whether the recognition/adhesion  or degradative functions of proteases are more crucial for coadhesion, we determined the effect of trypsin and other purchased proteases and proteins on coadhesion when they were incorporated in the coadhesion assay buffer or when a.  viscosus cells were pretreated with trypsin. coadhesion was measured by the decrease in turbidity caused by the absorption of a. viscosus cells from aqueous  suspension by p. gingivalis-coated hexadecane droplets. pretreatment of a. viscosus with trypsin had no obvious effect on the kinetics of coadhesion. likewise, trypsinization of a. viscosus failed to aid or enhance coaggregation by chemically induced, trypsin activity-deficient mutants of b. gingivalis. in contrast, incorporating trypsin in the buffer during the coadhesion assay yielded a concentration-dependent inhibition of coadhesion greater than the inhibition found with the same concentration of other proteases. coadhesion was also impaired to a greater extent by similar wt/vol concentrations of nonproteolytic proteins (bovine serum albumin (bsa), defatted bsa, gelatin, and casein), by antisera against whole p. gingivalis cells and fimbriae, by preimmune serum, and  by the amino acid arginine but not lysine. these findings suggest that the role of proteases in coadhesion is not solely to enzymatically "prime" a. viscosus for more avid coadhesion and that their role as potential protein or peptide seeking  adhesins should be considered.

TI  == nonspecific antibacterial factors in milk from cows immunized with human oral bacterial pathogens.
AB  == both the immunoglobulins and non-specific antibacterial factors in milk from cows immunized with pathogenic oral bacteria have the potential to influence the oral  microflora during passive immunization studies. the first six milks after calving were collected from 2 cows immunized with adjuvant and from 14 cows immunized with adjuvant and heat-killed strains of periodontopathic actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. analysis of the products from the first to the sixth milks revealed that the protein and lysozyme content decreased approximately 66 and 72%, respectively; the mean specific activity of the enzyme  remained relatively constant. in contrast, the mean lactoperoxidase activity increased 2.3-fold in the second milking and increased further in the fourth and  sixth milkings. the mean iron-binding activity increased 1.2-fold from the first  to the second milkings and then decreased 3.6-fold through the sixth milking. cows immunized with adjuvant alone showed similar responses. per unit volume, the milk contained approximately 150 times less lysozyme than whole human saliva obtained from six subjects but higher concentrations of lactoperoxidase and iron-binding components. purified bovine nonspecific factors prevented the growth of the bacteria used for immunization when bacteria were tested at concentrations similar to those found in saliva and milk. because bovine nonspecific antibacterial factors could influence both the pathogenic target bacteria and the indigenous microflora in oral passive immunization studies with bovine immunoglobulins, the presence of these proteins should be considered.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == the effect of 3 mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, listerine antiseptic (thymol), peridex (chlorhexidine), perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. at the baseline examination,  papillary bleeding score (pbs), and plaque index (pi) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. at day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (anova) to compare the 4 groups, followed by duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. at baseline, average pbs and pi scores were similar for all 4 groups. after 14 days, the average pbs for peridex and perimed was significantly  lower than for listerine antiseptic and water. the frequency of interdental units with a pbs greater than 2 was significantly lower for peridex and perimed than for listerine antiseptic and water. we concluded that both peridex and perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. in vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dental implant metals.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the specific in vitro antibacterial effect of seven dental implant metals on oral bacteria which have often been identified in failing implants. the metals chosen for evaluation were titanium, chromium, cobalt, aluminum, iron, gold, and vanadium. these metals were selected  because they are contained in many commonly used dental implants. the bacteria selected for this study included isolates of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaniogenica, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. sets of tubes containing either supplemented trypticase soy broth, brain-heart infusion-yeast extract, or brain-heart infusion-yeast extract with 5  percent defibrinated rabbit blood were aseptically prepared with doubling dilutions of the seven metals starting at an initial concentration of 500 micrograms/ml and terminating at 0 microgram/ml. cultures of each organism were inoculated into each set of broth tubes containing all concentrations of metals.  tubes were incubated either anaerobically or in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide for 48 hours at 35 degrees c and then assayed for atp content which was proportional to the viable cellular biomass. the results showed that, although being bacteria and concentration dependent, all seven metals suppressed the growth of each organism. the rank order of antibacterial activity expressed by dental implant metals was gold > titanium > cobalt > vanadium > aluminum > chromium > iron.

TI  == effects of ascorbic acid depletion and supplementation on periodontal health and  subgingival microflora in humans.
AB  == this study describes the relationship between varying ascorbate intake, periodontal status, and subgingival microflora as part of a multidisciplinary investigation of ascorbic acid (aa) metabolism in young men housed for 13 weeks in a nutrition suite that provided controlled periods of ascorbic acid depletion  and repletion. twelve medically healthy non-smoking men, aged 25 to 43 years, ate a rotating four-day diet adequate in all nutrients except ascorbic acid. following an initial baseline period during which the subjects received 250 mg aa/day, the subjects received 5 mg aa/day for a 32-day depletion period. eight of the 12 subjects participated in a subsequent 56-day repletion period designed to  replace the reduced body aa pool slowly. plasma and leukocyte ascorbate levels, plaque index, gingival index, probing depths, and attachment level were monitored at the beginning and end of the depletion and repletion periods. subgingival plaque samples were obtained and examined for selected organisms by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. a uniform oral hygiene program was reinforced after each examination. ascorbate concentrations in plasma and leukocytes responded rapidly to changes in vitamin c intake. there were no significant changes in plaque accumulation, probing pocket depth, or attachment level during  the study. in contrast, gingival bleeding increased significantly after the period of aa depletion and returned to baseline values after the period of aa repletion. however, no relationship could be demonstrated between either the presence or proportion of target periodontal micro-organisms and measures of bleeding or ascorbate levels.

TI  == effect of initial treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease on the frequency of peripheral blood t-lymphocytes specific to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == limit dilution analysis (lda) was used to determine the effect of initial treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease on the frequency of periodontopathic bacteria-specific t-cells in peripheral blood. eleven marginal gingivitis (mg) and 8 adult periodontitis (ap) subjects took part in the study. the proliferative t-lymphocyte precursor (ptl-p) frequencies to porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces viscosus were determined using lda and poisson statistics both before and after treatment. tetanus toxoid was used as a control  antigen. treatment resulted in a significant reduction in clinical disease parameters in both groups. the median peak ptl-p frequency for p. gingivalis was  significantly higher in the ap group compared with the mg group before treatment. this was not the case after treatment nor with a. viscosus. in the mg group the median peak ptl-p frequency with both p. gingivalis and a. viscosus declined as a result of treatment. although this decline was not statistically significant it may indicate an antigen-specific response in this group. in the ap group the median peak ptl-p frequency with p. gingivalis before treatment was 83.76 x 10(-6) (approximately 1 in 12,000) and after treatment it was 36.17 x 10(-6) (approximately 1 in 28,000). dose-response relationships showed at each concentration of organisms/well this trend for a decline in ptl-p frequency after treatment, suggesting that any increased responsiveness to this organism in this  group may be largely antigen-specific. however, there was no difference in this group in the median peak ptl-p frequency with a. viscosus before and after treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the comparative antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  == the antimicrobial effectiveness of calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol in root canals of extracted human teeth was compared. canals in single-rooted teeth were enlarged and inoculated with streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and bacteroides gingivalis or bacteroides fragilis. after treatment with a test agent and sealing and incubation for 1 hour, the canal contents were analyzed for the number of viable  test bacteria and compared with that of inoculated teeth not treated with test agents. all test agents exhibited antimicrobial activity against all bacteria, with percent reductions in viable bacteria ranging from 64.3% to 100%. the combined data for pulpdent paste and calcium hydroxide showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity than the combined data for camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol for s. mutans and b. gingivalis or b. fragilis but showed no difference for a. viscosus.

TI  == topical application of doxycycline on periodontally involved root surfaces in vitro: comparative analysis of substantivity on cementum and dentin.
AB  == in this study, substantivity of topically applied doxycycline hydrochloride on root surfaces obtained from patients with periodontal disease was studied in vitro. cementum and dentin specimens were impregnated with aqueous solutions of doxycycline for 3 minutes, and incubated in serum for 10 minutes, 7 days, and 14  days. substantivity was determined by agar diffusion inhibition assay. comparative analyses of cementum versus dentin groups were conducted with 2-way analysis of variance. results indicated that there was no statistically significant differences between the binding potential of doxycycline to cementum  and dentin specimens. antibacterial effect of specimens treated with the concentration of 100 mg/ml persisted for 14 days, indicating the presence of doxycycline in biologically active form. our findings demonstrate the long lasting substantivity of doxycycline hydrochloride on periodontally diseased root surfaces and supports the concept of using root surfaces as a substrate for the deposition and slow release for local tetracycline delivery.

TI  == effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  == surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. a polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. in all bacteria (b. gingivalis, streptococcus sobrinus, s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells  adsorbed to the cathode. treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of  cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. moreover, in the case of  b. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. these findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of b. gingivalis was  dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, b. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == microbiological studies of carious dentine from human teeth with irreversible pulpitis.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures were made from 29 extracted teeth with irreversible pulpitis to identify the predominant flora in different parts of deep carious lesions. most isolates were gram-positive rods, in which lactobacilli were the most frequent organisms, then other gram-positive, non-branching rods. gram-positive cocci were the next most common; only a low number of streptococcus mutans was recovered. two types of carious lesions were found, one with high numbers of lactobacilli, the other with low. in the 15 lesions with high numbers, lactobacilli constituted 91.9% of the total flora at the pulpal site and gradually decreased in number as the sampling moved away from the pulp. strep. mutans and alpha-haemolytic streptococci were not recovered from pulpal or deep carious sites in this group. in the 14 lesions with low numbers of lactobacilli, the flora was diverse. gram-positive cocci, anaerobic gram-positive non-branching rods, branching rods and/or bacteroides were the main isolates in a few of this group.

AB  == it has been proposed that bacteroides gingivalis and actinomyces viscosus are most important agents to pathogenesis of the periodontitis and gingivitis. in this study, the influences of sonic extracts prepared from b. gingivalis and a. viscosus for dna synthesis of murine lymphocytes, production of prostaglandin e2  (pge2), collagenase and interleukin-1 (il-1) from human peripheral monocyte were  investigated. furthermore, pge2 and collagenase production by fibroblasts from human periodontal ligament (hplf) and gingiva (gin 1) stimulated with macrophage  conditioned medium (mcm) cultured with bacterial sonic extracts were examined. the results obtained were as follows. 1. the sonic extracts (10 micrograms/ml protein) from b. gingivalis and a. viscosus showd low mitogenic activity to spleen cells, however, induced polyclonal b cell activation. 2. although, the effect of these sonic extracts on the production of pge2 and collagenase by human peripheral monocyte was not found, the induction of il-1 production was recognized. 3. the culture supernatants of c3h/hen mouse peritoneal macrophage stimulated with sonic extracts of b. gingivalis and a. viscosus were induced pge2 and collagenase production by hplf and gin 1. these results suggest that the cellular components of b. gingivalis and a. viscosus may play the pathogenic roles in periodontal tissue destruction through the stimulation of macrophage and/or lymphocyte.

TI  == changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. a 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  == it was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. during this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. high values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. the frequency of detection of actinomyces odontolyticus and of capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. the frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. however, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). a significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of a. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). in girls, a similar increase was obtained for a. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). the changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.

TI  == microbial changes associated with the development of puberty gingivitis.
AB  == in this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. during 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls  10 times. at the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the papillary bleeding index (pbi). a total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean pbi scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). the mean proportion of actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). among the species discriminated, only capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of pbi (p less than = 0.05). the detection frequencies of black-pigmented bacteroides (particularly b. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). these findings implicate capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of the activity of four antimicrobial agents using an in vitro rapid micromethod against oral streptococci and various bacterial strains implicated in periodontitis.
AB  == the activity of various antibacterial agents (amoxicillin, josamycin, doxycycline and metronidazole) was established in vitro using a rapid micromethod. the activity of these agents, which are widely used in oral medicine, was evaluated against microorganisms responsible for periodontitis and bucco-dental infections. their action against alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including pneumococci) which make up the majority of the indigenous oral flora was also tested. amoxicillin was found to be effective against all the strains tested. doxycycline was active  against periodontal bacteria, but not against 50% of the streptococcal flora. josamycin was found to be effective against streptococci, but appeared without effect on eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. metronidazole, inactive against streptococci, displayed greater activity towards  the strict anaerobes. the use of these antibiotics for the treatment of bucco-dental infections, especially periodontitis, is discussed. for periodontitis and periodontal suppurations, antimicrobial agents present a valuable adjunct to local treatments such as scaling or rootplaning. this may prevent more serious infections such as endocarditis that can develop after tooth extraction.

TI  == bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  == phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera actinomyces, bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus and streptococcus. the results revealed that actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. the other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects  of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.

TI  == effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius.
AB  == the effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of the type strain and fresh isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius was investigated. b. intermedius strains grew with and without glucose at a ph as low as 5.0. these bacteria grew almost as well as streptococcus mutans at ph 5.0 and  better than actinomyces viscosus at ph 5.5 and 5.0. some b. intermedius strains raised the culture ph when grown at a low ph without glucose. in contrast, p. gingivalis strains grew only at ph 6.5 to 7.0. the p. gingivalis strains had proteolytic activities against azocoll, azocasein, and azoalbumin, while the b. intermedius strains degraded azocasein and azoalbumin, but not azocoll. b. intermedius showed maximum proteolytic activity at ph 7.0, and high activity over a wide ph range. in contrast, the optimum ph of proteolytic activity in p. gingivalis was ph 7.5 to 8.0. the p. gingivalis activities were more sensitive than those of b. intermedius to low ph. the capacity of b. intermedius to degrade proteins to more readily metabolizable substrates at low ph might explain the growth of this bacterium in an acidic environment. these differences between b. intermedius and p. gingivalis could explain their capacity to survive at different sites in the oral cavity and indicate how b. intermedius might positively influence the growth of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.

TI  == [studies on plaque formed on implants].
AB  == in vivo plaque formation on implant materials was studied. when different implant materials were set on the gingiva, the number of adhering viable bacteria depended on material surface properties 4 hours after setting, but not 48 hours after setting. the formation of pellicle-like thin layers and subsequent covering by lamellarly formed plaque were observed on the surfaces of all materials. streptococcus species were predominant at the 4-hour setting time but anaerobes increased at the 48-hour setting time; this was common to all materials. the results indicate that surface properties of the implants influence early bacterial adherence, but do not influence bacterial flora or plaque maturation. the subgingival microflora at the neck of implants with clinically normal peri-implant tissues was compared with that at the neck of natural teeth. the bacterial isolates were classified based on their biochemical characteristics. for the spirochaetes, the number was counted directly under light microscopic observation. the most predominant bacterial species was streptococcus, followed by actinomyces, neisseria and then capnocytophaga at both sites. the ratio of spirochaetes in the microflora was extremely low for both the implant and natural tooth. such a bacterial distribution pattern closely resembled the hitherto-reported distribution of bacteria existing in a healthy gingival crevicular. this suggested that the microflora in plaque at the neck of a normal  implant is basically similar to that at the neck of a natural tooth. in conclusion, plaque formation on implant materials was not influenced by their surface properties in actual oral cavity.

TI  == selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells  and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a  model for study. bacteria studied included streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, actinomyces  species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and  bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis studied. in contrast, the number of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and a. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. treatment of  buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and a. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of b. gingivalis and b. intermedius were significantly increased. treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human pmns produced similar selective effects. the changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.

TI  == role of cryptic receptors (cryptitopes) in bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces.
AB  == progress in characterizing the receptors that promote bacterial attachment to teeth and oral epithelial cells has suggested that hidden molecular segments may  frequently be involved. such cryptic receptors, referred to as 'cryptitopes', may become exposed by several mechanisms. hidden segments of salivary acidic proline-rich proteins evidently become exposed when the molecules undergo a conformational change as they adsorb to apatitic mineral. adhesins of actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria are able to bind to these cryptitopes, and this enables these organisms to bind to proline-rich proteins on apatitic surfaces while avoiding interactions with these proteins in  solution. cryptitopes may also become exposed as a result of enzymatic action. thus, several bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii and bacteroides intermedius, have adhesins that bind to galactosyl receptors which become exposed after treatment with neuraminidase.  similarly, the adhesion of some gram-negative bacteria, such as bact. gingivalis, is enhanced when tissue surfaces are treated with certain proteases, or lysosomal enzymes derived from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. it seems likely that elevated levels of enzymes present in gingival fluid as sequelae of poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may generate cryptitopes for potentially periodontopathic  bacteria, and thereby contribute to modulation of the gingival flora.

AB  == the effect of heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria on the production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and an il-1 inhibitor by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn's) was examined. peripheral blood was obtained from 18 healthy volunteers and the pmn's were separated using dextran sedimentation and ficoll-paque density gradient centrifugation. the pmn's (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were cultured in serum-free media with or without heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria. four gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria were used; bacteroides gingivalis fdc 381, bacteroides forsythus fdc 338, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 and fusobacterium nucleatum fdc 263. the non-oral fusobacterium mortiferum atcc 25557 was used as a control organism. il-1 activity was assayed using thymocyte proliferation. the non-oral organism f. mortiferum stimulated il-1 production by  pmn's, in contrast none of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated il-1 release  although the bacteria themselves had an il-1 enhancing effect. following fractionation of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated pmn supernatants, an il-1 inhibitory fraction was identified. these results may illustrate a further mechanism by which periodontopathic bacteria may evade the protective effect of pmn's and may also suggest a regulatory role for pmn's in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.

TI  == increased periodontal bone loss in temporarily b lymphocyte-deficient rats.
AB  == in order to study the role of t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes in the development  of marginal periodontitis, experiments were performed on specific-pathogen-free (spf) rats with various immunologic profiles. the study comprised nude (congenitally t lymphocyte-deficient), thymus-grafted nude (t-lymphocyte reconstituted), anti-mu treated (temporarily b lymphocyte-deficient), and normal  rats. when they were 5 to 9 weeks old, some of the rats were inoculated with actinomyces viscosus. bacteroides gingivalis and a strain of oral spirochetes; 90 days later they were killed. a. viscosus and b. gingivalis colonized readily, but the spirochete strain could not be established permanently in the oral cavity of  the rats, 95% of the inoculated rats raised serum igg or igm antibody against one or more of the microorganisms; nude rats tended to raise less antibody than the three other experimental groups. inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than controls. anti-mu treated inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than nude and normal rats, whereas no difference was found between normal, nude, and thymus-grafted rats. it is concluded that permanent t-lymphocyte deficiency did not interfere with the development of periodontal disease in this model, whereas a temporary and moderate reduction in b-lymphocyte numbers seemed to predispose for aggravation of periodontal bone loss.

TI  == influence of age and immunization on development of gingivitis in rats.
AB  == to study the effect of age and antigenic priming on the development of gingivitis, 33 healthy rats were placed in contact with streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides gingivalis. on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after inoculation, the gingival condition was judged clinically and histologically, and serum antibody titers against the bacteria were measured. the rats were divided into three groups: 1 month old, 3 months old, and 3 months old immunized. none of the young rats developed gingivitis during the experiment, whereas half of the adult and all of the adult immunized rats bled on probing on days 7 and 14. in general, antibody titers against the bacteria were low in young rats, moderate in adult rats, and high in adult immunized rats. these results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigens than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.

TI  == [microbiological and serological investigation of periodontal disease activity].
AB  == if disease activity in periodontal disease can be determined, the therapeutic measures of periodontitis may become diverse and different from patient to patient. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of microbiological and serological examination of periodontopathic bacteria in detecting destructive periodontal disease activity. one hundred and forty-eight sites in 52 subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis were studied clinically. clinical parameters included plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and percent bone loss as measured radiographically. subgingival plaque of whole sites was investigated microbiologically by means of  indirect fluorescent-antibody technique with rabbit antibodies against actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2 serotypes), eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. the levels of serum igg antibody to these organisms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations. thirty-two of 52 subjects were instructed in oral hygiene and received several sessions of scaling and root planing. the clinical, bacteriological and serological assessments were also performed after periodontal therapy. active disease site was defined as the site of which clinical status did not be improved even after periodontal treatment. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. viscosus were detected in 80% of periodontal lesions, and the proportion of b. gingivalis  was the highest among six bacterial species tested. a. actinomycetemcomitans, e.  corrodens and f. nucleatum were found only occasionally and in low numbers. the proportion of b. gingivalis was higher in severely inflamed sites than in clinically healthy sites. b. gingivalis and b. intermedius are rarely found in treated periodontitis sites, while the proportion of a. viscosus was slightly increased after treatment. sera of the pre-treatment patients demonstrated significantly higher antibody levels to b. gingivalis and significantly lower levels to a. viscosus than those of healthy persons. antibody levels reactive with other four species in the patients did not significantly differ from the levels in healthy persons. after periodontal therapy, antibody levels to b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a) significantly decreased and the levels to a. viscosus increased to a slight degree. b. gingivalis was found more frequently in disease-active sites than in disease-inactive sites. the proportions of other bacterial species in disease-active sites did not differ from those in disease-inactive sites. the results of the present investigation suggest that monitoring b. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and serum igg antibody titer against this organism may aid in  the description and adequate treatment of the periodontal disease.

TI  == humoral immune response to selected subgingival plaque microorganisms in insulin-dependent diabetic children.
AB  == juvenile diabetics have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to gingivitis and periodontitis following puberty. however, little data are available on changes in the microbial flora that occur at the onset of puberty. this study was performed to determine if antibacterial antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms might be helpful in revealing changes in plaque flora at the onset and conclusion of puberty. sera was obtained from 35 subjects (ages 7 to 18 years) selected from a population of  insulin-dependent diabetics. the subjects were given a thorough medical examination which included an assessment of sexual maturation and a dental examination which included the recording of onset and magnitude of bleeding according to the papillary bleeding score. antibody titers to a. naeslundii (an), b. intermedius (bi), b. gingivalis (bg), f. nucleatum (fn), a. actinomycetemcomitans (aa), c. ochracea (co) and t. denticola (td) were determined using the microelisa. stratification of antibody titers by age groups  (less than or equal to 12 years, 12 to 15 years, greater than 15 years) revealed  that titers to an increased significantly (p less than 0.025, anova) and progressively (p less than 0.05, regression analysis) with increasing age. in contrast, the titers to fn were maximal in the under 12 year group and decreased  with age (anova, p less than 0.05; regression analysis, p less than 0.05). there  were no significant variations in titers observed for the other microorganisms. stratification by sexual maturity revealed a similar progressive decrease of the  titer to fn (anova, p less than 0.05; regression analysis, p less than 0.005).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparison of different assays for the aggregation of oral bacteria by human whole saliva.
AB  == for comparison, human whole saliva-induced aggregation was studied by phase-contrast microscopy, spectrophotometry combined with macroscopic observations, and in microtiterplate assay under identical experimental conditions for actinomyces viscosus hg 85 (t14-v) and hg 380 (t14-av), bacteroides gingivalis hg 66 (w 83), streptococcus rattus hg 59 (bht), and streptococcus sanguis i hg 169. the entire process of formation, extension, and sedimentation of aggregates could merely be observed by the combination of these  assays. the very first stages of aggregation could only be detected and quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy. within 2 1/2 min, 50% of the a. viscosus, s. rattus, and s. sanguis cells were aggregated, denoted as t50. in microtiterplates, however, aggregates were observed in general only after sedimentation at 30-45 min of incubation, expressed as ta. for interpretation of  the spectrophotometric curves, additional microscopic and macroscopic data were a prerequisite. the small decline in absorbance during the first 30-45 min (phase 1) corresponded to the formation and extension of nonsedimenting aggregates, whereas the subsequent pronounced fall in absorbance (phase 2) was caused by the  massive sedimentation of aggregates. the moment of inflexion between both phases, ti, marked the onset of sedimentation of aggregates and corresponded very well with ta, at which time already 92-98% of the cells were aggregated as quantitated by microscopy. in conclusion, only by microscopy the formation and extension of aggregates could be observed within a few minutes and quantitated in terms of aggregation rate. from 30-45 min, merely the sedimentation of aggregates was visualized in microtiterplates, whereas the time course of the overall process was recorded indirectly by spectrophotometry.

TI  == an in vitro method to study the adherence of oral bacteria to hela cells.
AB  == exfoliated buccal epithelial cells have been widely used in microbial adherence studies, but present a number of problems due to their variable nature and to contamination with indigenous bacteria. an adherence assay was developed using hela cell monolayers which were washed with buffer, or treated with saliva or serum to mimic buccal or crevicular epithelial cells, respectively. a total of eighteen strains of oral bacteria tested showed a low affinity for untreated hela cells, but most strains adhered in high numbers to saliva treated hela cells. a few strains, usually present in the gingival crevice, demonstrated a high affinity for serum treated hela cells. thus, salivary and crevicular fluid components appear to be specifically implicated in the selective adherence and colonization of bacteria on oral surfaces.

TI  == dna probe detection of key periodontal pathogens in juveniles.
AB  == recognition of juvenile forms of periodontitis have been shown to be directly linked with specific gram-negative rods, primarily actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. however, clinical application of these laboratory findings have generally been restricted to the research environment. the purpose of this study was to explore  the relationship of these three pathogenic species in children using the reliable and accurate new technology of dna probes. results indicated that the pathogenic  oral flora did not differ significantly between subjects with and without gingival inflammation. therefore, tracking of pathogens using clinical parameters of inflammation are unreliable and accurate monitoring requires microbiological testing in order to properly identify the presence or absence of pathogens.

TI  == use of percoll density gradients for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral  epithelial cells.
AB  == an assay for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral epithelial cells has been developed which utilizes percoll density gradient centrifugation to separate bacteria and epithelial cells. 3h-thymidine-labeled bacteria were incubated with  suspensions of buccal epithelial cells in microtitration plates for 2.5 hr at 35  degrees c. the mixtures were then subjected to density gradient centrifugation in 50% percoll. epithelial cells with attached bacteria formed a band near the top of the tube, while unattached bacteria formed a band near the bottom. the epithelial cells were collected on membrane filters, and the number of attached bacteria was determined by scintillation counting. binding of s. mitis c5 was found to increase with time, and equilibrium was attained within two hr. saturation of available binding sites occurred when 10(7) s. mitis cells were incubated with 1.5 x 10(4) buccal epithelial cells. the numbers of streptococci which attached as determined with this assay were in good agreement with values obtained by direct microscopic counts. adsorption of s. mitis c5 cells was adequately described by a langmuir isotherm (correlation coefficient 0.998). this permitted calculation of estimates of the number of binding sites and the affinity of the organism. the assay proved reliable even when as few as 1000 epithelial cells were used. treating the epithelial cells with neuraminidase or trypsin significantly decreased the number of s. mitis c5 cells which attached. in contrast, binding of a. naeslundii 12104 to neuraminidase-treated cells was increased, and attachment of b. gingivalis 381 was also enhanced, especially to epithelial cells which had been treated with trypsin.

TI  == intergeneric rosettes: sequestered surface recognition among human periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the human oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and bacteroides loescheii, when mixed in equal numbers in vitro, formed large settling coaggregates. as the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until  at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. rosettes consisting of a streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling multigeneric aggregates. the ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of  human periodontal disease.

AB  == in edentulous patients, the microbial colonization of permucosal implants of sintered hydroxyapatite was studied. samples were taken from mucosa and dentures  before insertion of implants and from supra- and subgingival sites two to 10 weeks after insertion. in total, five patients and 10 implants with clinically healthy peri-implant tissues were studied. the samples were investigated by dark-field microscopy and anaerobic culture. the supragingival plaque of the implants was dominated by gram-positive cocci and rods, the subgingival plaque by haemophilus spp. and veillonella parvula. a group of bacteria was found specifically related to the implants: actinomyces odontolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena, and leptotrichia buccalis. black-pigmented bacteroides was not found in any of the examined samples. spirochetes were observed in denture plaque samples and in supragingival plaque of the implants. it is concluded that bacteria known as potential periodontal pathogens colonize the permucosal implants in the first weeks after insertion. the presence of these species seems to be dependent on the ecological factors provided by the artificial gingival crevice of the permucosal implants in the edentulous mouth.

TI  == attachment of oral bacteria to a basement-membrane-like matrix and to purified matrix proteins.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of oral bacteria to an in vitro basement-membrane-like matrix and to selected individual macromolecular  constituents of this matrix. radiolabeled bacteria were incubated with basement-membrane-like matrices isolated from pf hr-9 cells. bacteroides gingivalis 33277, fusobacterium nucleatum fn-2, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ga3(a) bound to the matrix in the range of 44 to 70%, considerably higher than the ranges of a. actinomycetemcomitans ga3(na) and suny  ab67 (range, 20 to 25%). the attachment of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and actinomyces spp. was much less frequent (range, 6 to 25%). competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that preincubating the bacteria with fibronectin significantly decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 51% but increased the binding of other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms tested. similarly, preincubating the matrices with antifibronectin antibodies decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 31%, whereas the other bacteria tested were either unaffected or binding was increased. the adherence of bacteria to purified basement membrane proteins was also investigated. strain and species differences were seen in binding, but no clear relationship emerged between binding to an intact matrix and binding to isolated  matrix proteins. the results of this study suggest that some gram-negative oral bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease, such as b. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum, bound in high numbers to basement-membrane-like matrices in vitro. on the other hand, the gram-positive strains tested bound in much fewer numbers. the results suggest that further studies with this in vitro model may aid in understanding the mechanisms by which oral bacteria adhere to basement membranes.

TI  == bacteroides gingivalis-actinomyces viscosus cohesive interactions as measured by  a quantitative binding assay.
AB  == there is limited evidence, mostly indirect, to suggest that the adherence of bacteroides gingivalis to teeth may be enhanced by the presence of gram-positive  dental plaque bacteria like actinomyces viscosus. the purpose of this study was to carry out direct quantitative assessments of the cohesion of b gingivalis and  a. viscosus by using an in vitro assay modeled on the natural sequence in which these two species colonize the teeth. the assay allowed comparisons to be made of the adherence of 3h-labeled b. gingivalis 2561 and 381 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha) and a. viscosus wvu627- or t14v-coated s-ha (actinobeads) in equilibrium and kinetics binding studies. a series of preliminary binding studies with 3h-labeled a. viscosus and parallel studies by scanning electron microscopy with unlabeled a. viscosus were conducted to establish a protocol by which actinobeads suitable for subsequent bacteroides adherence experiments could be prepared. by scanning electron microscopy, the actinobeads had only small gaps of exposed s-ha between essentially irreversibly  bound a. viscosus cells. furthermore, b. gingivalis cells appeared to bind preferentially to the actinomyces cells instead of the exposed s-ha. b. gingivalis binding to both s-ha and actinobeads was saturable with at least 2 x 10(9) to 3 x 10(9) cells per ml, and equilibrium with saturating concentrations was reached within 10 to 20 min. b. gingivalis always bound in greater numbers to the actinobeads than to s-ha. these findings provide direct measurements supporting the concept that cohesion with dental plaque bacteria like a. viscosus may foster the establishment of b. gingivalis on teeth by enhancing its adherence.

AB  == bacteroides loescheii pk1295 serves as a coaggregation bridge between streptococcus sanguis 34 and actinomyces israelii pk14, two gram-positive oral bacteria that are otherwise unable to coaggregate. whereas coaggregation with s.  sanguis 34 is inhibited by lactose, no simple sugar was found that inhibited coaggregation with a. israelii pk14. coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of b. loescheii pk1295 were isolated for the purpose of identifying the surface components responsible for the interaction with each coaggregation partner. selection for spontaneously occurring cog- mutants gave rise to two phenotypic classes of mutants. type i lost the ability to coaggregate with s. sanguis 34, whereas type ii failed to coaggregate with either s. sanguis 34 or a. israelii pk14. purified fimbriae from the parent agglutinated cells of both partners, and  agglutination with s. sanguis 34 was inhibited by lactose. denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of both a 75- and a 43-kilodalton (kda) protein associated with parental fimbriae, but only a 43-kda protein was seen with fimbriae prepared from the type i mutant. neither polypeptide was found in similar preparations from the type ii  mutants. our data suggest that coaggregation of b. loescheii pk1295 with both gram-positive partners is mediated by fimbria-associated proteins present on the  surface of the gram-negative organism and that the 75- and 43-kda polypeptides are responsible for the recognition of s. sanguis 34 and a. israelii pk14 cells,  respectively.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

AB  == we assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative as well as the gram-positive oral bacteria. the alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane)  and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against fusobacterium nucleatum, also  associated with periodontal disease. seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against actinomyces species. all test agents were active against streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == characterization of lectinlike surface components on capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 that mediate coaggregation with gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the interactions between capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 and streptococcus sanguis h1, actinomyces naeslundii pk984, or actinomyces israelii pk16 are dependent on specific recognitions between heat-sensitive adhesins on c. ochracea and heat-stable structures (probably carbohydrate-containing receptors) on the surfaces of these gram-positive coaggregation partners. the coaggregation of c. ochracea with each of these three organisms was inhibited by l-rhamnose and d-fucose and to a lesser extent by beta-methyl-galactoside. the reaction with s.  sanguis was the most sensitive, while the coaggregation with a. israelii was the  least sensitive and was only partially inhibited by each of the sugars that were  considered to be effective inhibitors. a more effective inhibition of the coaggregation between c. ochracea and a. israelii was achieved by adding a combination of the 6-deoxysugars and n-acetylneuraminic acid. to further characterize the coaggregations, naturally occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of c. ochracea were obtained from several different selections. three phenotypically distinct groups of mutants were were isolated. type 1 mutants failed to coaggregate with s. sanguis only. type 2 mutants lost ability to interact with both s. sanguis and a. naeslundii. type 3 mutants failed to coaggregate with all three coaggregation partners. characterization of the cog- mutants by sugar inhibition studies made it possible to distinguish three classes of adhesin activity.

TI  == multigeneric aggregations among oral bacteria: a network of independent cell-to-cell interactions.
AB  == a radioactivity-based assay was developed to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in multigeneric aggregates. the cell types in these multigeneric aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. the coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes took part in the more complex multigeneric aggregations. competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. however, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to multigeneric aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. this not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. although the molecular mechanisms responsible for multigeneric aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of multigeneric aggregates. while the human oral cavity is a prime example of a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions.

AB  == protease and peptidase enzymes are thought to play a role in the virulence of many oral organisms, especially those associated with periodontal diseases. in order to evaluate the peptidases of periodontopathogens, we compared the arylaminopeptidase activities of bacteroides gingivalis with those of other oral  and non-oral bacteria. sixty-three bacterial strains representing the prominent cultivable organisms in human periodontal pockets were tested, including representatives of the black-pigmented bacteroides, actinobacillus, actinomyces,  campylobacter, capnocytophaga, eikenella, fusobacterium, haemophilus, lactobacillus, streptococcus, and veillonella species. each micro-organism was examined for its ability to hydrolyze 18 synthetic substrates of beta-naphthylamide derivatives of amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides. quantitation of the enzyme activity was accomplished by colorimetric measurement  of the amounts of released beta-naphthylamines. n-cbz-glycyl-glycyl-l-arginine-beta-naphthylamide was readily cleaved by b. gingivalis, but slightly or not at all by the other oral strains tested. l-arginine-beta-naphthylamide was cleaved by b. gingivalis, capnocytophaga species, and streptococcus species, but not readily by the other bacteroides strains. some dipeptide substrates tested, such as glycyl-l-arginine- and glycyl-l-proline-beta-naphthylamide, were strongly cleaved by b. gingivalis and weakly cleaved by other bacteroides strains. since high levels of n-cbz-glycyl-glycyl-l-arginyl-aminopeptidase activity are characteristic of b. gingivalis, its measurement may be valuable in the identification of this organism in clinical samples as an aid in diagnosis and monitoring of periodontal infections. furthermore, this and other aminopeptidases produced by b. gingivalis and other oral organisms may play a role in the tissue destruction seen in periodontal disease.

TI  == coagglutination reactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  == an agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, s. mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with c. albicans. no interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of c. albicans. preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of f. nucleatum and a. viscosus to c. albicans  is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to c. albicans. the possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral  candidal clearance are discussed.

TI  == fluorescent antibody and flagella stains for rapid detection of bacteria at periodontally healthy and diseased sites.
AB  == two rapid methods of identifying bacteria associated with periodontal disease were investigated to determine their diagnostic usefulness in longitudinal or epidemiologic studies. three nonmotile organisms were identified by fluorescent antibody stains (fa) while percentages of motile bacteria were assessed by counting all spirochetes, flagellated and nonflagellated organisms stained with a simplified silver-plating stain for flagella. relationships between disease activity and these bacteria from subgingival plaque samples taken at 18 individual sites (12 diseased, 6 healthy) were determined by correlating the quantity of detectable bacteria with the gingival index (gi), plaque index (pli)  and probing depth (pd). the highest correlations found with the fa stains were between bacteroides gingivalis and probing depth (rs = 0.85), gi (rs = 0.80) and  pli (rs = 0.80). bacteroides melaninogenicus and/or bacteroides intermedius also  correlated well with the gi (rs = 0.66), pli (rs = 0.64), and pd (rs = 0.59), but to a lesser degree than b. gingivalis. flagella stains showed that spirochetes correlated highly with pd (rs = 0.82), as did the total motile group with pli (rs = 0.82). motile bacteria alone were only moderately associated with the clinical  parameters measured. the results of this investigation suggest that fa- and flagella-staining methods can be valuable screening tools for the detection of bacterial species and motile organisms in longitudinal or epidemiologic studies.

TI  == effects of ammonia and volatile fatty acids produced by oral bacteria on tissue culture cells.
AB  == culture filtrates of several bacterial species isolated from the oral cavity were tested for their effects on two types of tissue culture cells: vero cells, the continuous cell line of african green monkey kidney cells; and chondrocytes, isolated from 15-day-old chick embryo tibiae. only a limited number of bacterial  species--i.e., the asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteroides species and fusobacterium species--affected the two cell types. the effect on vero cells, detected by the rounding of the cells, correlated with the butyric acid concentration in the bacterial supernatant, which confirms previous findings. a small enhancement of this effect was found with propionic acid and ammonium ions. the same strains which affected vero cells also affected chondrocytes, detected by a vacuolization of the cells. however, volatile fatty acids on their own had no visible effect on these cells. instead, ammonium ion in the culture filtrate,  when present in concentrations of 20 to 60 mmol/l, proved to be responsible for vacuolization of the chondrocytes. the volatile fatty acids (butyric and propionic) had a limited additive effect. no effects were visible with cell extracts of the bacteria.

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

TI  == the habitat of periodontopathic micro-organisms.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the significance of oral mucosal surfaces as a habitat of periodontopathic micro-organisms. for this investigation, 7 young adults were selected for an experimental gingivitis study. at the start of the experiment, bacterial samples were taken by means of a sterile swab from 4 oral mucosal surfaces: the buccal mucosa, the vestibular fold, the dorsum of the tongue and a tonsil. all individuals were asked to abstain from oral hygiene procedures in 1 quadrant of the mouth for a period of 23 days. at the end of this period, plaque samples were taken from 4 tooth surfaces by means of a sterile periodontal probe just coronal from the gingival margin. the study included evaluation of spirochetes and motile organisms by means of phase-contrast microscopy and of black-pigmented bacteroides, fusobacterium, actinomyces, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga by means of cultural studies. results showed a relationship between the prevalence of motile organisms and black-pigmented bacteroides in samples from both the mucosal surfaces and the 23-day-old plaque. in addition, a  relationship was found between the presence of motile organisms on the dorsum of  the tongue at the start of the experiment and their prevalence in the 23-day-old  plaque. it was suggested that the dorsum of the tongue may function as a nidus for periodontopathic micro-organisms.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  == the fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loeschii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus prevotii, clostridium sporogenes, and propionibacterium acnes. the fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of b. gingivalis  and b. intermedius. in addition, strains of the nonoral bacteroides species b. asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. no such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, lactobacillus, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, or haemophilus species.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == cultivable microflora of plaque from full denture bases and adjacent palatal mucosa.
AB  == anaerobic cultural techniques and rapid biochemical identification tests normally employed for periodontal plaque were utilized for the analysis of plaque samples  taken from denture bases and corresponding adjacent mucosa. results were compared with those or more comprehensive microbiological investigations. forty four samples were obtained from the denture bases and adjacent palatal mucosa of 12 patients wearing full upper dentures. the specimens were then collected in reduced transport fluid and processed in the anaerobic glove box. samples were plated on enriched trypticase soy agar (etsa) and cultured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. in addition plaque samples were plated on sabouraud medium. facultative bacteria predominated in both denture and palatal plaques. significantly greater numbers of cocci were recovered in the samples from palatal mucosa. more rods were found in denture plaque. anaerobes were present in both instances. among the anaerobes, saccharolytic bacteroides were identified with the highest frequency, while veillonella species were present in the greatest quantity. recovery of yeasts was similar for both etsa and sabouraud media incubated aerobically. as has been found in other microbiological studies candida albicans represented only a minor part of the total cultivable flora.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == effects of peptidoglycans from periodontal pathogens on selected biological activities of cd-1 murine peritoneal macrophages.
AB  == resident cd-1 murine peritoneal macrophages were exposed to various concentrations of purified peptidoglycan isolated from members of the genera bacteroides, eikenella, and actinomyces. macrophage viability, the release of lysozyme, acid phosphatase, and prostaglandins e1 and e2 were assayed as a function of peptidoglycan concentration and time. macrophages responded as a function of peptidoglycan concentration with increased release of acid phosphatase and prostaglandins; all cells remained greater than 90% viable during the course of the experiments. however, concentrations of peptidoglycan greater than 50 micrograms/ml were toxic to the macrophages, while the peptidoglycan from b. capillus strain 925.08 and actinomyces viscosus strain t14av consumed complement by both the classical and the alternate pathways. cellular lysozyme activity and phagocytosis of saccharomyces cerevisiae were significantly reduced  in the presence of peptidoglycan. when viewed by scanning electron microscopy, the activated macrophages were rounded, lacked distinct pseudopod extensions, and possessed an increased number of microvilli and plasma membrane associated vesicles. these morphological alterations occurred as early as 3 h. transmission  electron microscopy revealed the purified peptidoglycan to have been taken up into numerous phagosomes; however, even after 24 h incubation, it was only partially degraded.

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == colonization of the subgingival area by bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  == the initial event in colonization of the subgingival area by b. gingivalis is its attachment to host cells and gram-positive bacteria in pre-formed plaque. the level of b. gingivalis is partly governed by products of other plaque bacteria, especially by sanguicin. once b. gingivalis resides in its nidus and starts to proliferate, expulsion of pre-existing residents may occur, especially of attached gram-positive bacteria, through the inhibitory action of the b. gingivalis product, hematin. the bacteriocin produced by black-pigmented bacteroides also seems to play an important role in their establishment. melaninogenicus possessed strong inhibitory activity against actinomyces species. this was not completely confirmed with fresh isolates of b. gingivalis from advanced periodontitis patients. various factors other than inhibitory substances produced by b. gingivalis and related bacteria can also affect the colonization of this species. since the crevice area is influenced by gingival fluid, the nature of specific antibody and the other affecting components should be considered collectively with the interaction between new predominant colonizers and other pre-existing residents.

TI  == anaerobes as normal oral flora.
AB  == the human mouth provides a suitable habitat for numerous bacterial genera. anaerobic genera or genera that include anaerobic members found in the oral cavity are actinomyces, arachnia, bacteroides, bifidobacterium, eubacterium, fusobacterium, lactobacillus, leptotrichia, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, propionibacterium, selenomonas, treponema, and veillonella. the incidence of anaerobes varies with age of the individual and with specific sites sampled. in edentulous infants, the incidence of anaerobes is relatively low. in adults, anaerobes are invariably present but are more prevalent in samples from the gingival sulcus than they are in samples from the gingival margin, tooth surfaces, buccal mucosa, tongue, or saliva. in samples from the healthy gingival  sulcus, anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli are found in the range of 5%-14%; gram-negative bacilli in the range of 13%-29%; veillonella in the range of 2%-8%; and gram-positive cocci in the range of 1%-15% of the cultivable flora. from marginal plaque and plaque from the tooth surface, gram-positive bacilli, gram-positive cocci, and veillonella appear to be the predominant anaerobes. in saliva, veillonella are the most numerous anaerobes.

TI  == anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

TI  == pathogenic synergy: mixed infections in the oral cavity.
AB  == in almost all infections in the oral cavity, mixed populations of bacteria are present. however, recent evidence points to a certain specificity in these infections: streptococcus mutans is related to caries and black-pigmented bacteroides species are suspected pathogens in periodontal disease. periodontal diseases, endodontic infections and submucous abscesses in the oral cavity are probably mixed infections in which anaerobic bacteria together with facultatives  or other anaerobes are present. in experimental mixed anaerobic infections black-pigmented bacteroides strains have been shown to play a key role. little is known about the pathogenic synergy between the bacteria involved in mixed infections. important mechanisms could be nutritional interrelationships and interactions with the host defense. within the group of black-pigmented bacteroides b. gingivalis seems to be the most virulent species. these bacteria possess a great number of virulence factors, which might be important in the pathogenesis of oral infections.

AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

TI  == plasmid content of some oral microorganisms isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  == eighty-five strains of bacterial species selected from the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of patients with different periodontal pathologies were examined for their plasmid content. microorganisms studied included: actinomyces  viscosus, a. odontolyticus, bacteroides asaccharolyticus (b. gingivalis), b. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius, and subspecies melaninogenicus, capnocytophaga ochracea (b. ochraceus), and fusobacterium nucleatum. three b. melaninogenicus isolates showed plasmids of approximately 2.7-2.9 mdalton (mega-dalton) molecular size. restriction enzyme digests of the plasmids demonstrated dissimilar patterns when electrophoresed on agarose gels. in other microorganisms, including the actinomyces species, plasmids were not observed.

TI  == cell-mediated and humoral immune responses of guinea-pigs to the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus is a gram-positive facultative rod indigenous to most human  mouths. the guinea-pig was evaluated as a model for assessing cellular immune responses to a human strain of a. viscosus. guinea-pigs, immunized with heat-killed a. viscosus cells or a water-soluble extract from a. viscosus (avs),  were tested for delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to a. viscosus 4 weeks after immunization. a week later, the guinea-pigs were terminated. lymphocytes from peripheral blood, lymph node and spleen were tested for in-vitro blastogenic responses to heat-killed a. viscosus or the water-soluble extract. plasma from these guinea-pigs were tested for the presence of precipitating antibodies. positive in-vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and antibody responses to avs occurred only in immunized guinea-pigs. a strong in-vitro blastogenic response to avs or heat-killed a. viscosus occurred in lymphocytes from immunized guinea-pigs, but a weak response was detected in un-immunized animals. these data suggest that the guinea-pig can be used to evaluate different parameters of the immune response to oral bacteria such as a. viscosus.

TI  == the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of beagle dogs with periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora was studied in 10 adult female beagle dogs with advanced periodontitis. supragingival and subgingival plaque from a maxillary third premolar (p3) was removed and cultured anaerobically on various growth media and all colonies were subcultured and partially characterized. histopathological specimens of the plaque sampling sites showed significant loss of connective tissue attachment. spirochetes were found in all samples. anaerobic gram-negative organisms were predominant in both types of plaque accounting for about 55% of the cultivable organisms in the supragingival  plaque and almost 75% in the subgingival plaque. bacteroides asaccharolyticus was the most predominant organism in the supragingival plaque, whereas fusobacterium  nucleatum predominated in the subgingival flora. streptococcal and actinomycotic  species were common in the supragingival plaque, but their proportions, especially those of the actinomycetes, were decreased in the subgingival flora. in many respects the bacterial profile associated with disease resembled that reported in human periodontal disease.

TI  == lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  == we assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. when the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. the actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas streptococcus sanguis, campylobacter, and eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. the response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. however, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides asaccharolyticus and treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. these results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease  states.

TI  == modulation of immunoreactivity to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms during pregnancy.
AB  == the lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. in addition, a group  of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in  response to the same stimulants. the stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides [capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin a, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). intrinsic (cells cultured in male ab plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. there was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. we propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.

TI  == the effect of intensive antibacterial therapy on the sulcular environment in monkeys. part i. changes in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus.
AB  == the changes induced in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus were evaluated as  part of a study considering the keratinizing potential of the sulcular epithelium when bacterial plaque was essentially eliminated. two rhesus monkeys were scaled  and placed on a daily therapeutic regimen which included a prophylaxis, systemic  tetracycline, and topical chlorhexidine. over the 40 day experimental period and  74 days post-therapy, subgingival plaque samples were taken periodically. the plaque samples were cultured anaerobically and aerobically to determine the predominant bacterial flora. the total cultivable bacterial flora decreased from  initial levels by greater than 99.9% with the antibacterial therapy. the flora shifted with therapy from one dominated by anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides melaninogenicus (18%) and fusobacterium species (13.9%), to a flora dominated by organisms growing aerobically. during treatment b. melaninogenicus and fusobacterium species were not detected in any sample. after cessation of all therapy the anaerobes increased to dominance again, but b. melaninogenicus remained undetectable through 74 days post-therapy.

TI  == clinical and microbiological aspects of chemotherapeutic agents used according to the specific plaque hypothesis.
AB  == certain forms of dental decay and periodontal disease appear to be due to specific bacterial infections following overgrowth of certain indigenous plaque bacteria, i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis, if so, then antimicrobial treatment based on a diagnosis of elevated levels or proportions of these organisms should be considered. such treatment cannot be administered according to concepts of the non-specific plaque hypothesis. a treatment philosophy is presented which is based upon considerations long established in medical infections following overgrowth of certain indigenous plaque bacteria, i.e., the  specific plaque hypomicrobial to the site of the infection for periods long enough to suppress or destroy the pathogenic agent. examples of this treatment philosophy are given.

TI  == the role of bacteroides melaninogenicus and other anaerobes in periodontal infections.
AB  == recent taxonomic and anatomical studies of dental plaque associated with periodontal health and disease have demonstrated that differences in the microbial populations in plaque may be responsible for the initiation and progression of disease. the consistent isolation of large numbers of anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria from the depths of periodontal lesions has suggested an  important role for these organisms. bacteria that have been isolated include capnocytophaga (bacteroides ochraceus), other species of bacteroides, fusobacterium, selenomonas, spirochetes, campylobacter, veillonella, actinomyces, propionibacterium, peptococcus, and other genera. the periodontopathic potential  of oral strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus has been explored in a number of investigations because these organisms are consistently isolated from periodontal lesions. studies of b. melaninogenicus have included purification of a capsular substance, characterization of the lipopolysaccharide and a variety of toxic substances and lytic enzymes, and ecologic aspects of its colonization. understanding of the nature and pathogenic mechanisms of the oral microbiota may  lead to control of this pandemic infection.

TI  == attachment of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets.
AB  == this investigation examined the ability of cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal  pockets. of 48 asaccharolytic strains of b. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of b. melaninogenicus strains. both asaccharolytic and fermentative b. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of  several gram-positive bacteria tested, including actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, streptococcus sanguis, and s. mitis. b. melaninogenicus  subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of b. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. these observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit  the attachment of b. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. this was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of b. melaninogenicus 381-r were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. after 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. high numbers of b. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. these data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment  and colonization of b. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.

TI  == blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: comparison  of individuals with periodontal disease to normal and edentulous subjects.
AB  == cell-mediated immunity in humans to antigens derived from oral plaque bacteria was investigated by using the lymphocyte blastogenesis assay. subjects with varying severities of periodontal disease including normal, gingivitis, periodontitis, and edentulous were compared. mononuclear leukocytes were separated from peripheral blood and cultured with antigens prepared by sonication of actinomyces viscosus (av), actinomyces naeslundii (an), veillonella alcalescens (va), leptotrichia buccalis (lb), bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm), and homologous dental plaque (dp). the lymphocyte response of subjects with gingivitis or periodontitis was significantly greater than that of normal subjects to antigens of av, an, and dp, but did not differ from the response of edentulous subjects. periodontitis subjects were significantly more reactive than edentulous and normal subjects in response to va, lb, and bm. these findings suggest that the tested gram-negative bacteria and the host response they evoke are associated with advanced periodontal destruction.
