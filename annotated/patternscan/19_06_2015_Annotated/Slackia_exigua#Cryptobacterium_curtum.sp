TI  == degradation of arginine by slackia exigua atcc 700122 and cryptobacterium curtum  atcc 700683.
AB  == slackia exigua atcc 700122(t) and cryptobacterium curtum atcc 700683(t) were our  isolates from infected root canal and human periodontal pocket, respectively; they are asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods, which are predominant in the oral cavity. they utilize arginine, so our aim was to investigate the pathway of arginine degradation. metabolic end products were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography. the related enzymatic activities in cell-free extract were also assayed. both s. exigua and c. curtum degraded arginine and produced substantial amounts of citrulline, ornithine and ammonia. arginine and citrulline supported the growth of both strains. as the related enzymatic activities, arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase and carbamate kinase activities were detected in the cell-free extract of s. exigua and c. curtum. arginase and urease activities were not detected in either organism. these results suggest that arginine was metabolized by the arginine deiminase pathway. both s. exigua and c. curtum degrade arginine via the arginine deiminase pathway.

TI  == characterisation of eubacterium-like strains isolated from oral infections.
AB  == the genus eubacterium currently includes a heterogeneous group of gram-positive,  non-spore-forming anaerobic bacilli, many of which are slow growing, fastidious and generally unreactive in biochemical tests. as a consequence, cultivation and  identification of isolates are difficult and the taxonomy of the group remains indifferent. in this study, 105 isolates from odontogenic infections, infections  associated with dental implants or saliva from healthy subjects and provisionally assigned to the genus eubacterium were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic analysis. ninety-one of the isolates were identified as belonging to one of 14 previously described species: atopobium parvulum (5 isolates), a. rimae (29), bulleidia extructa (2), cryptobacterium curtum (1), dialister pneumosintes (1), eubacterium saburreum (2), e. sulci (8), e. yurii subsp. yurii (1), filifactor alocis (3), lactobacillus uli (1), mogibacterium timidum (13), m. vescum (6), pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (6) and slackia exigua (13). the remaining 14 isolates did not correspond to existing species. this study confirms the diversity of organisms provisionally assigned to the genus eubacterium by conventional identification methods. this group of organisms is frequently isolated from oral infections but their role in the aetiology of these conditions has yet to be determined.
