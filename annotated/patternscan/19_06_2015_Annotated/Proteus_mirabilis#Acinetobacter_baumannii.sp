TI  == susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in jordan and lebanon: smart 2011-2013.
AB  == objectives: to investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (uti) and intra-abdominal infection (iai) in medical centres of jordan and lebanon. methods: gram-negative bacilli from the smart study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. these isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. results: among the 523 uti-associated isolates, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 iai-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers among uti-associated e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. corresponding rates among iai-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. acinetobacter baumannii and p. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. ctx-m-15  was the most prevalent esbl produced. seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to  carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). conclusions: the alarmingly high rates of esbl production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == wild mushroom extracts as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  == microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. these microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. the use of natural products  has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. the present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. four gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of russula delica, fistulina hepatica, mycena rosea, leucopaxilus giganteus, and lepista nuda extracts. the results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). among the five tested extracts against e. coli, leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. the extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon p. mirabilis biofilm formation were sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and russula delica (53.1%). acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by russula delica extract). this is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.

TI  == gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  == wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. however, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. for this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis)  were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. by applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; mycobacterium bolletii, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium botulinum. the genus treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified  at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. using specific real-time pcr on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria bartonella spp. borrelia spp., coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. we estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == a survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  == objectives: to learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (bhr) inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern china. methods: a multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids was developed and used to determine these bhr plasmids. the difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (mdro) and non-mdro were assessed using a chi-square test. results: the average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for incn, incp, incq, incw, and inca/c in descending order. the distribution of all five bhr plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. the prevalence rates of all five bhr plasmids in mdros were significantly higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb). conclusions: bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. the prevalence rates in mdro are higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for nfgnb.

TI  == antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  == background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k.  pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed  in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == [one-year surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in major bacteria except for mrsa isolated in eight medical facilities in kumamoto prefecture].
AB  == to investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except mrsa) in kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-escherichia coli, esbl-klebsiella species, esbl-proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant enterococcii in eight general hospitals from may in 2009 to april in 2010. esbl-e. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant p. aeruginosa came second. the isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase,  while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant p. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals.  however, the isolation numbers of esbl-klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant p.  aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred  from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.

TI  == evaluation of factors affecting mortality in fournier's gangrene: retrospective clinical study of sixteen cases.
AB  == objective: fournier's gangrene is a progressive, necrotizing fasciitis due to synergistic infection of the perineum and external genitalia that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. the purpose of this study is to review the diagnostic and treatment methods that effect mortality in fournier's gangrene. material and methods: sixteen patients who were diagnosed and treated at our clinic between 2011 and 2013 due to fournier's gangrene were retrospectively analyzed. the surviving and non-surviving patient groups were compared in terms of age, sex, onset time of symptoms, isolated microorganisms, concomitant diseases, fournier's gangrene severity index (fgsi), and length of hospital stay. results: ten of our cases (62.5%) were male and six (37.5%) were female, with a mean age of 61.2+/-12.3 (42-73) years. the mortality rate was 18.8% (3 cases). the mean duration of symptoms before admission was 4.31+/-1.81 (2-8) days. this period was 6.67+/-1.52 days in patients who succumbed to death, and 3.77+/-1.42 days in patients who survived (p=0.007). ten cases (62.5%) had concomitant diabetes mellitus. the most common organism isolated in wound cultures was escherichia coli (68.7%), and acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. in the remaining patients. the mean fgsi of surviving patients was 3.84+/-1.77, and 7.66+/-0.57 in fatal cases (p=0.003). the mean length of hospital stay was 25.5 days (2-57) and duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in survivors (p<0.05). conclusion: the delay in diagnosis and higher fgsi may be responsible for worsening of prognosis and mortality in fournier's gangrene. early diagnosis  and determination of the severity of the disease, aggressive surgical debridement and appropriate antimicrobial therapy may improve prognosis.

AB  == despite 70 years of clinical use, beta-lactam antibiotics still remain at the forefront of antimicrobial chemotherapy. the major challenge to these life-saving therapeutics is the presence of bacterial enzymes (i.e., beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyze the beta-lactam bond and inactivate the antibiotic. these enzymes can be grouped into four classes (a-d). among the most genetically diverse are the class d beta-lactamases. in this class are beta-lactamases that can inactivate the entire spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). class d beta-lactamases are mostly found in gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa , escherichia coli , proteus mirabilis , and acinetobacter baumannii . the active-sites of class d beta-lactamases contain an unusual n-carboxylated lysine post-translational modification. a strongly hydrophobic active-site helps create the conditions that allow the lysine to combine with co2, and the resulting carbamate is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds. the carboxy-lysine plays a symmetric role in the reaction, serving as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile in the acylation reaction, and the deacylating water in the second step. there are more  than 250 class d beta-lactamases described, and the full set of variants shows remarkable diversity with regard to substrate binding and turnover. narrow-spectrum variants are most effective against the earliest generation penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalothin. extended-spectrum variants (also known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, esbls) pose a more dangerous clinical threat as they possess a small number of substitutions that allow them to bind and hydrolyze later generation cephalosporins that contain bulkier side-chain constituents (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime). mutations that permit this versatility seem to cluster in the area surrounding an active-site tryptophan resulting in a widened  active-site to accommodate the oxyimino side-chains of these cephalosporins. more concerning are the class d beta-lactamases that hydrolyze clinically important carbapenem beta-lactam drugs (e.g., imipenem). whereas carbapenems irreversibly acylate and inhibit narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, class d carbapenemases are able to recruit and activate a deacylating water. the rotational orientation of the c6 hydroxyethyl group found on all carbapenem antibiotics likely plays a role in whether the deacylating water is effective or not. inhibition of class d beta-lactamases is a current challenge. commercially available inhibitors that are active against other classes of beta-lactamases are ineffective against class d enzymes. on the horizon are several compounds, consisting of both beta-lactam derivatives and non-beta-lactams, that have the potential of providing novel leads to design new mechanism-based inactivators that are effective against the class d enzymes. several act synergistically when given in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and others show a unique mechanism of inhibition that is  distinct from the traditional beta-lactamase inhibitors. these studies will bolster structure-based inhibitor design efforts to facilitate the optimization and development of these compounds as class d inactivators.

TI  == outbreak of a cluster with epidemic behavior due to serratia marcescens after colistin administration in a hospital setting.
AB  == serratia marcescens causes health care-associated infections with important morbidity and mortality. particularly, outbreaks produced by multidrug-resistant  isolates of this species, which is already naturally resistant to several antibiotics, including colistin, are usually described with high rates of fatal outcomes throughout the world. thus, it is important to survey factors associated with increasing frequency and/or emergence of multidrug-resistant s. marcescens nosocomial infections. we report the investigation and control of an outbreak with 40% mortality due to multidrug-resistant s. marcescens infections that happened from november 2007 to april 2008 after treatment with colistin for acinetobacter baumannii meningitis was started at hospital h1 in 2005. since that year, the epidemiological pattern of frequently recovered species has changed, with an increase of s. marcescens and proteus mirabilis infections in 2006 in concordance with a significant decrease of the numbers of p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. a single pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) cluster of s. marcescens isolates was identified during the outbreak. when this cluster was  compared with s. marcescens strains (n = 21) from 10 other hospitals (1997 to 2010), it was also identified in both sporadic and outbreak isolates circulating  in 4 hospitals in argentina. in132::iscr1::blactx-m-2 was associated with the multidrug-resistant cluster with epidemic behavior when isolated from outbreaks.  standard infection control interventions interrupted transmission of this cluster even when treatment with colistin continued in several wards of hospital h1 until now. optimizing use of colistin should be achieved simultaneously with improved infection control to prevent the emergence of species naturally resistant to colistin, such as s. marcescens and p. mirabilis.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

TI  == antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
AB  == chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn  model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p  = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide a3-apo in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  == although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide a3-apo has only modest activity against escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse  models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with  conventional antibiotics. in this study, the efficacy of a3-apo in several additional mouse models was investigated, including staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed klebsiella pneumoniae-a. baumannii-proteus mirabilis wound infection and k. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. in the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following a3-apo treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. the wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a3-apo upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. one of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.

TI  == synthesis and spectrum of the neoglycoside achn-490.
AB  == achn-490 is a neoglycoside, or "next-generation" aminoglycoside (ag), that has been identified as a potentially useful agent to combat drug-resistant bacteria emerging in hospitals and health care facilities around the world. a focused medicinal chemistry campaign produced a collection of over 400 sisomicin analogs  from which achn-490 was selected. we tested achn-490 against two panels of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, many of which harbored ag resistance mechanisms. unlike legacy ags, achn-490 was active against strains expressing known ag-modifying enzymes, including the three most common such enzymes found in enterobacteriaceae. achn-490 inhibited the growth of ag-resistant enterobacteriaceae (mic(90), </=4 mug/ml), with the exception of proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (mic(90), 8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively). achn-490 was more active alone in vitro against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates with ag-modifying enzymes than against those with altered permeability/efflux. the mic(90) of achn-490 against ag-resistant staphylococci was 2 mug/ml. due to its promising in vitro and in vivo profiles, achn-490 has been advanced into clinical development as a new antibacterial agent.

TI  == failure of tigecycline to treat severe clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection is an emerging and often difficult-to-treat iatrogenic complication. recent data suggest that tigecycline, a novel antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, can be used successfully to treat patients with severe clostridium difficile infection. we report a 70-year-old man who developed severe clostridium difficile infection, was admitted to the intensive care unit and eventually succumbed to complications of his illness despite receiving tigecycline for approximately three weeks in combination with vancomycin, metronidazole and intravenous immunoglobulin. additionally, we discuss the unique challenges that emerged during tigecycline treatment, such as  the development of proteus mirabilis bacteraemia and of colonisation with acinetobacter baumannii resistant to tigecycline. finally, we review data on other cases reported in the medical literature. even though tigecycline looks promising for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection, we urge caution against its indiscriminate use for off label indications.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two croatian hospitals: mystic study results.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. we now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective gram-negative pathogen groups from two croatian hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. a total of 1510 gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi.there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. almost  20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in e. coli was 10% and in k. pneumoniae 49%. pcr and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of shv-5 in nine e. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. five k. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(shv-5 )gene. eight esbl positive enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and ctx-m beta-lactamases. plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases were not found among k. pneumoniae, e. coli and enterobacter spp. three a. baumannii strains from zagreb university center were identified by multiplex pcr as oxa-58 like producers. six a. baumannii strains from split university center were found to possess an isaba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(oxa-51 )gene. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. these data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for a. baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacilli from yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance among bacteria pathogens is a world-wide issue. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogenic bacteria are essential to guide empirical and pathogen-specific therapy; unfortunately, these data are scarse in cameroon. objective: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated in yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 505), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) in  yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology between march 1995 and april  1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) by the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. results: high rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. resistance to all isolates was mostly observed for amoxicillin (87%), piperacillin (74%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (73%). susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and monobactame (aztreonam) were = 91% for escherichia coli, = 71% for klebsiella spp., = 98% for proteus mirabilis, = 50% for enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefotaxime (2%) and aztreonam (33%), and highly susceptible to ceftazidime (72%) whereas acinetobacter baumannii was highly resistant to aztreonam (100%), to cefotaxime (96%) and cetazidime (62%). imipenem (98%) was the most active antibiotic followed by the ofloxacine (88%). susceptibility of all isolates to gentamicin was 67%. conclusion: these results indicate that surveillance to antimicrobial resistance in cameroon is necessary to monitor microbial trends, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and provide information for choosing empirical or direct therapy to physicians.

TI  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (febla), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (lf) from non-lactose fermenters (nlf) in comparison with macconkeys agar. performance of febla was at par with the latter. on febla medium, the contrast between lf and nlf colonies was pronounced and klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on macconkeys agar (hi media). unlike macconkeys agar, a 24 h culture of k. pneumoniae cells on febla were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. no change in cell morphology was evident with regard to salmonella typhi, s. paratyphi a, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter koseri and acinetobacter baumannii. performance of the medium was controlled using e. coli and s. flexneri. febla is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: smart 2004 programme data.
AB  == we investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against gram-negative bacterial isolates from intensive care units (icus) in taiwan. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from icus of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam  concentration of 4 mg/l and 8 mg/l or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam had better activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/l (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/l for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/l for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). for acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant p. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and a.  baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam) isolates. results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam  are dependent on the method used. piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

TI  == antibacterial activity of zuccagnia punctata cav. ethanolic extracts.
AB  == the present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/ml. minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding mic values. contact bioautography, indicated that zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. activity-guided fractionation of 1he  ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with mic values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/ml for proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia. these values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/ml). zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == nosocomial transmission of ctx-m-2 beta-lactamase-producing acinetobacter baumannii in a neurosurgery ward.
AB  == three strains of cefotaxime (ctx)-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, fm0209680, fm0300106, and fm0301433, were isolated from transtracheal aspirate cultures of three patients with probable nosocomial infections in a neurosurgery ward in japan. the ctx mics for these isolates were greater than 128 microg/ml but were drastically reduced in the presence of 4 microg of clavulanic acid per ml. these  strains were also resistant to ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime, and aztreonam but were susceptible to ceftazidime and imipenem. the profile of resistance to various broad-spectrum beta-lactams was transferred by conjugation. strain fm0209680 was  not eradicated from case patient 1 by administration of imipenem, ceftazidime, and levofloxacin, even after a 6-month hospitalization period. strains fm0300106  and fm0301433 were isolated from case patients 2 and 3 during the sixth week following admission, respectively, and then each patient was colonized for 3 weeks. eradication of fm0300106 was successfully obtained from case patient 2 by  imipenem treatment, while administration of imipenem was continued to prevent pneumonia. prophylactic antimicrobial therapy was discontinued in case patient 3  because of the lack of pneumonic symptoms, and fm0301433 disappeared after the discontinuation of antimicrobial chemotherapy. all three strains carried the bla(ctx-m-2) gene, and the appearance of colonies in the growth-inhibitory zones  around disks of ctx and aztreonam in double-disk synergy tests suggested inducible beta-lactamase production in these a. baumannii strains. the ribotyping investigation suggested that all these strains belong to the same clonal lineage. the plasmids harbored by a. baumannii had the same restriction profile as those harbored by proteus mirabilis strains previously isolated in a urology ward of the funabashi medical center.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases), an expanding family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases) constitute a rapidly growing cluster of enzymes that have disseminated geographically. the ctx-m-ases, which hydrolyze cefotaxime efficiently, are mostly encoded by transferable plasmids, and the enzymes have been found predominantly in enterobacteriaceae, most prevalently in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. isolates of vibrio cholerae, acinetobacter baumannii, and aeromonas hydrophila encoding ctx-m-ases have also been reported. the ctx-m-ases belong to the molecular class  a beta-lactamases, and the enzymes are functionally characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. this group of beta-lactamases confers resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams, and the enzymes are inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam. typically, the ctx-m-ases hydrolyze cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime, which is reflected in substantially higher mics to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime. phylogenetically, the ctx-m-ases are divided into four subfamilies that seem to have descended from chromosomal beta-lactamases of kluyvera spp. insertion sequences, especially isecp1, have been found adjacent to genes encoding enzymes  of all four subfamilies. the class i integron-associated orf513 also seems to be  involved in the mobilization of blactx-m genes. this review discusses the phylogeny and the hydrolytic properties of the ctx-m-ases, as well as their geographic occurrence and mode of spread.

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  == between january 1986 and december 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital. to compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among  our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). in this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. of the pathogens, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by viridans (v.) streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. other rare organisms including acinetobacter baumannii, salmonella group b and d, proteus mirabilis, group b, d, and non-a, non-b and non-d streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. there was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with v. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with k. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. the timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates  to a glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from european intensive care units: data from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection  (mystic) programme.
AB  == susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 european icus participating in the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme (1997-2000). the most commonly isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), escherichia coli (19.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). the incidence of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in turkish, russian and italian icus (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). the frequency of ampc-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. meropenem was more active against proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). against acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against p. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli and k. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from european icus actively using meropenem.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: trust and tsn data for the united states. tracking resistance in the united states today. the surveillance network.
AB  == from january to may 2000, as part of the tracking resistance in the united states today (trust) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the united states. isolates were tested for  susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. in addition, data for the same period were  collected from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the us. both surveillance methods produced similar results. against isolates of enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by trust and tsn surveillance. trust identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens. isolates of p. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). other results from trust included pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, trust; 87.4% susceptible, tsn) against acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against stenotrophomonas maltophilia. s. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). against 513 urinary isolates of escherichia coli in trust, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. trust and tsn data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. trust centralized in vitro and electronic (tsn)  surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == transferable antibiotic resistance in multiresistant nosocomial acinetobacter baumannii strains from seven clinics in the slovak and czech republics.
AB  == sixty-seven multiresistant nosocomial acinetobacter baumannii isolates from patients hospitalized mostly in intensive care units of seven clinics in slovak and czech republic were tested to determine their ability to transfer antibiotic  resistance. all isolates were resistant to kanamycin, ticarcillin, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam and susceptible to carbapenems, sulbactam and  ampicillin/sulbactam. sixty-five out of 67 strains transferred resistance determinants to escherichia coli k-12 and proteus mirabilis p-38 recipients. analysis of selected transconjugants by an indirect selection method showed a more variable pattern of transferred resistance determinants. the clonal spread of strains transferring resistance seems to be an additional risk for occurrence  of strains resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == low-level colonization and infection with ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli in a skilled nursing facility.
AB  == background: we report a 1-year surveillance study that evaluates colonization and infection with ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) and the relation to quinolone use and other possible risk factors in a proprietary skilled nursing facility (snf) with no history of outbreaks. methods: rectal swabs obtained quarterly were streaked on macconkey agar with ciprofloxacin discs (5 microg) to screen for cr gnb and later were speciated and the antimicrobial susceptibilities were confirmed by standardized disc-diffusion tests. results: the mean prevalence of cr gnb colonization was 2.6% (range 0.9% to 5.3%). the colonization frequency was higher in the last survey than it was in the first survey. cr gnb-colonized strains included pseudomonas species (21%), but more than half were non-pseudomonas enterics such as acinetobacter baumannii (25%), proteus mirabilis (17%), and providencia stuartii (13%). none of the patients who had colonization with cr gnb had subsequent infections with the same species. patients with colonization had more exposure to ciprofloxacin and they were more  likely to have been recently admitted from an acute-care hospital and have decubitus ulcers. during the study period, of 336 patients surveyed, 98 (29%) patients developed suspected infections and cultures were done; the infection rate was 4.7 per 1000 patient days. of these infected patients, 59 (60%) were infected by gnbs; the infection rate was 2.3 per 1000 patient days. nineteen percent of the gnb infections were treated with a quinolone. (overall, quinolones constituted about 17% of antibiotic usage in the snf). only 3 (5%) of the patients infected with gnb were infected with cr gnb, including pseudomonas and providenci a species. the cr gnb infections involved multiple sites, multiple organisms, and long length of stay in the snf. conclusions: the findings indicate that in this community snf, a low frequency of colonization or infection with cr  gnb existed. whether continued moderate use of quinolones will lead to increasing levels of cr gnb will require further study.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ceftibuten (cbt) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,416 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae, mic 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (i) naturally non beta-lactamase producing species: e. coli 0.12-0.5, shigella 0.06-0.12 and salmonella 0.03-0.12, p. mirabilis 0.16-0.03. (ii) chromosomal penicillinase producing species: k. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and k. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (iii) chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii 1-  greater than 128: s. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + proteus 0.06-0.12. activity of cbt was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, cbt was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. cbt was inactive on p. aeruginosa (mic greater than or equal to 32) and  on a. baumannii (8- greater than 128). haemophilus and gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to cbt (mic 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for meningococci; b. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin g) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin g). cbt was inactive on staphylococci. enterococci and streptococci b were generally resistant; streptococci a, c, g were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas mic for other streptococci 0.12 to 128 (mic 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). these antibacterial properties particularly against enterobacteriaceae placed cbt in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
