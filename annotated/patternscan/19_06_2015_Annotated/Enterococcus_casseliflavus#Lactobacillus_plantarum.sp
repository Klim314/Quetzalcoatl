TI  == phenotypic and genotypic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional pickles of the cubuk region in turkey.
AB  == a total of 152 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from pickles produced in  the ankara-cubuk region. these isolates were clustered into eight groups on the basis of their phenotypic characteristics including cell morphology, co2 production from glucose, growth at 10 and 45 degrees c, growth in 6.5 % nacl, and growth at ph 9.6. api 50 ch carbohydrate fermentation test, 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) sequence analysis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) whole-cell protein profile analysis were also performed for precise identification of the isolates at the species level. molecular identification revealed that the most prevalent lab species involved in pickle fermentation were pediococcus ethanolidurans (46 isolates, 30.3 %), lactobacillus brevis (37 isolates, 24.3 %), lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates, 24.3 %), and lactobacillus buchneri (15 isolates, 9.9 %). other lab were found in minor frequencies such as pediococcus parvulus (8 isolates, 5.3 %), lactobacillus namurensis (6 isolates, 3.9 %), lactobacillus diolivorans (1 isolate, 0.7 %), lactobacillus parabrevis (1 isolate, 0.7 %), and enterococcus casseliflavus (1 isolate, 0.7 %). when results of phenotypic and genotypic identification methods  were compared, differences in the species distribution of lab associated with pickles were defined between the api and the 16s rrna sequencing. the api 50 chl  test coincided with the 16s rrna results in 71 out of the 152 tested isolates, indicating that api gave unreliable identification results. a clear correlation could not be found between the results of whole-cell sds profiles and 16s rrna sequencing. therefore, molecular characterization by 16s rrna sequencing was considered to be the most reliable method for identifying isolates. the results presented in this work provide insight in to the lab population associated with traditional cubuk pickles and constitute a lab strain resource for further studies involving the development of starter cultures.

TI  == cloning and heterologous expression of plne, -f, -j and -k genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  == plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plne, -f, -j and -k structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. these amplicons were cloned and expressed in pet32a (+) vector in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). plne, -f, -j and -k peptides were expressed as his-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. the peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. the cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against listeria innocua nrrl b33314, micrococcus luteus mtcc 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as enterococcus casseliflavus nrrl b3502, lactococcus  lactis lactis nrrl 1821, lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b4562 and lactobacillus plantarum nrrl b4496. e. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == lactobacillus pobuzihii is a novel species which has been previously found in pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan. however, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) microflora in pobuzihi has not been studied in detail. in this study, lab from pobuzihi were isolated, identified, and characterized. a total of 196 lab were isolated; 79 cultures were isolated from the sample collected from a manufacturing factory, 38 from pobuzihi samples  collected from 4 different markets, and 79 from 2 fresh cummingcordia samples. these isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into eight groups (a to h) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in most samples during the fermentation of pobuzihi. on the other hand, enterococcus casseliflavus and weissella cibaria were, respectively, the major species found in the two fresh cummingcordia samples. a potential novel species or subspecies of lactococcal strain was found. in addition, seven l. plantarum and five w. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab existing in the pobuzihi during its fermentation process and the final product on the market.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == genotypic diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from african traditional alkaline-fermented foods.
AB  == aim: to identify and compare lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from alkaline fermentations of cassava (manihot esculenta crantz) leaves, roselle (hibiscus sabdariffa) and african locust bean (parkia biglobosa) seeds for production of, respectively, ntoba mbodi, bikalga and soumbala. methods and results: a total of  121 lab were isolated, identified and compared by phenotyping and genotyping using pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its-pcr),  repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) and dna sequencing. the results revealed  a diversity of genera, species and subspecies of lab in african alkaline fermentations. the isolates were characterized as nonmotile (in most cases) gram-positive rods, cocci or coccobacilli, catalase and oxidase negative. its-pcr allowed typing mainly at species level, with differentiation of a few bacteria at subspecies level. rep-pcr permitted typing at subspecies level and revealed significant genotypic differences between the same species of bacteria from different raw materials. dna sequencing combined with use of api 50chl and api 20strep systems allowed identification of bacteria as weissella confusa, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus hirae from ntoba mbodi; ent. faecium, ent. hirae and pediococcus acidilactici from bikalga and soumbala. conclusion: lab found in african alkaline-fermented foods belong to a range of genera, species and subspecies of bacteria and vary considerably according to raw material. significance and impact of the study: our study confirms that lab survive in alkaline fermentations, a first crucial stage in determining their significance and possible value as probiotic bacteria.

TI  == dynamics and biodiversity of populations of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid  bacteria involved in spontaneous heap fermentation of cocoa beans in ghana.
AB  == the ghanaian cocoa bean heap fermentation process was studied through a multiphasic approach, encompassing both microbiological and metabolite target analyses. a culture-dependent (plating and incubation, followed by repetitive-sequence-based pcr analyses of picked-up colonies) and culture-independent (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [dgge] of 16s rrna gene amplicons, pcr-dgge) approach revealed a limited biodiversity and targeted population dynamics of both lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) during fermentation. four main clusters were identified among the lab isolated: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and enterococcus casseliflavus. other taxa encompassed, for  instance, weissella. only four clusters were found among the aab identified: acetobacter pasteurianus, acetobacter syzygii-like bacteria, and two small clusters of acetobacter tropicalis-like bacteria. particular strains of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, and a. pasteurianus, originating from the environment, were well adapted to the environmental conditions prevailing during ghanaian cocoa bean heap fermentation and apparently played a significant role in the cocoa bean fermentation process. yeasts produced ethanol from sugars, and lab produced lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol from sugars and/or citrate. whereas l. plantarum strains were abundant in the beginning of the fermentation, l. fermentum strains converted fructose into mannitol upon prolonged fermentation. a. pasteurianus grew on ethanol, mannitol, and lactate and converted ethanol into acetic acid. a newly proposed weissella sp., referred  to as "weissella ghanaensis," was detected through pcr-dgge analysis in some of the fermentations and was only occasionally picked up through culture-based isolation. two new species of acetobacter were found as well, namely, the species tentatively named "acetobacter senegalensis" (a. tropicalis-like) and "acetobacter ghanaensis" (a. syzygii-like).

TI  == enterococcus and lactobacillus contamination of raw milk in a farm dairy environment.
AB  == enterococci and lactobacilli are ubiquitously found in the intestinal microflora  of humans and animals. the aim of the present study was to determine the importance of bovine faeces as a source of these organisms in raw milk. one hundred and fifty six putative enterococci and 362 lactobacilli were isolated from bovine faeces (n=26), cows' teats, raw milk, the milking machine and the milking environment on one farm. the clonal relationships of each group were investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and representatives of the different clusters were identified by repetitive dna element (rep)-pcr fingerprinting, protein profiling, phenylalanyl-trna synthase (phes) sequence analysis or 16s rdna gene sequencing. lactobacilli were present at approximately  3 orders of magnitude greater than enterococci in the bovine faeces. the majority of the bovine faecal enterococcal isolates were identified as aerococcus viridans. seven teat isolates belonged to a potential novel aerococcus sp. and one bovine faecal isolate to a potential second novel aerococcus sp. the lactobacilli present in the bovine faeces were predominantly lactobacillus mucosae and lactobacillus brevis, with small numbers of lactobacillus plantarum.  only one enterococcus (a strain of e. casseliflavus) out of 76 and one lactobacillus (a strain of l. parabuchneri/kefir) out of 247 of the bovine faecal isolates was found in the milk. the major source of these bacteria in the milk was the milking equipment.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == identification and characterization of enterococcus species isolated from forage  crops and their influence on silage fermentation.
AB  == forty-eight strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from forage crops, and  their identification, characterization and influence on silage fermentation were  studied. all isolates were gram-positive, short-chain-forming, catalase-negative, and facultatively anaerobic cocci that did not produce gas from glucose, only formed l-lactic acid, and were able to grow at ph 9.6%, in 6.5% nacl, or with 40% bile, but not below ph 4.5. these isolates were commonly isolated from forage crops, and they were divided into four groups (a, b, c, and d) according to sugar fermentation characteristics. selected strains of fa 5, fa 27, fa 45, and fa 57 were identified as enterococcus hirae, e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, and e. mundtii, respectively, on the basis of dna-dna homology, strains fa 5, fa 27, fa  45, and fa 57 and two strains from commercial inoculants, lc 10 (lactobacillus casei) and lp 15 (l. plantarum), were used as additives to alfalfa and guinea grass silages. alphalfa and guinea grass silages inoculated with lc 10, lp 15, fa 5 + lc 10, and fa 5 + lp 15-treatments in alfalfa and guinea grass silages had significantly lower ph values, contents of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen, gas production, and dry matter losses compared with the control silage after 60 d of  fermentation. however, the e. hirae fa 5, e. faecalis fa 27, e. casseliflavus fa  45, and e. mundtii fa 57-inoculated silages gave similar values to the control in both types of silage. the fa 27 + lc 10 and fa 27 + lp 15-inoculated silages did  not differ in fermentation quality from lc 10 and lp 15-inoculated silages alone. the results confirmed that enterococcus species were not able to improve silage quality.
