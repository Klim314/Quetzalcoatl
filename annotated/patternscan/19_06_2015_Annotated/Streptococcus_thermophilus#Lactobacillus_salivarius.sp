TI  == the probiotic vsl#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for crohn's disease.
AB  == background & aims: probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of crohn's disease after surgery. we  investigated the ability of vsl#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of vsl#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of lactobacillus, 3 strains of bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence  at day 90 received vsl#3 until day 365. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. results: at day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between vsl#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, p = .19). the proportions  of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 from days 90 through 365) (p = .09). aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early vsl#3 group and  42.1% in the late vsl#3 group. patients receiving vsl#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (p < .05). crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. conclusions: there were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received vsl#3 and patients who received placebo. lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early vsl#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for  prevention of crohn's disease recurrence. clinical trials.gov number: nct00175292.

TI  == treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of lactobacillus  salivarius ls01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  == goals: to evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by streptococcus thermophilus st10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (ad). background: previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in ad symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain l. salivarius ls01. s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. study: a prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum  could improve the activity of l. salivarius ls01 administered at high doses to adults with ad. twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. scoring atopic dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. results: a significant improvement in scorad index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. a slight decrease in fecal s. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. conclusions: data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for l. salivarius ls01 in the treatment of ad. the addition of tara gum and s. thermophilus st10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.

TI  == functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. foodborne lab have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (ar) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. we have previously reported isolation of ar lab from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while ar genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by pcr amplification, thus pointing at the need for  more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. we turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial dna extracted directly from the food matrix. to maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total dna extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus genomes. we report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer ar phenotype to recipient bacteria. we also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. survival of e. coli o157:h7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain e. coli o157:h7 cocktail (7 log(10) cfu/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% nacl brine at 10 and 21 masculinec for 28 d. nacl concentration, water activity (a(w)), ph,  and numbers of e. coli o157:h7 and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were determined in  cheese and brine. e. coli o157:h7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculinec regardless of the presence of starter lab, although the latter significantly enhanced e. coli o157:h7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculinec. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) cfu/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% nacl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter lab and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of starter lab at 10 masculinec. the pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. the salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the nacl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. values of ph and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == viability of probiotic lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. to exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) cfu/g or ml throughout its shelf life. one of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. the objective of this study was to  investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. yoghurts with l. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus),  added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. yoghurt without  probiotic added was produced as a control. the products were stored at 4 degrees  c and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. in these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters ph and acidity were analyzed. the results were evaluated using analysis of variance and tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. l. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) cfu / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. when the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of l. casei except for the first day of storage.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  == biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. in this study, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for  a large collection of lab of different origins. the tested isolates belong to 11  species of the lactobacillus genus and to streptococcus thermophilus, streptococcus salivarius and lactococcus garvieae. the results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (bc), triclosan (tr), chlorhexidine (ch), and sodium hypochlorite (sh) are not frequent among lab. moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high mic values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher mic values for the other biocides.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics in preventing episodes of acute otitis media in high-risk children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: several studies have suggested that probiotics (prob) and/or prebiotics (preb) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. we aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with prob and preb could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (aom). methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from november 2007 to april 2009, 37 pediatricians in france enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of aom who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with prob (streptococcus thermophilus ncc 2496, streptococcus salivarius dsm 13084, lactobacillus rhamnosus lpr cgmcc 1.3724) and preb (raftilose/raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). during 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of aom episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by  the poisson model (incidence rate ratio [irr]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% ci]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. results: we enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). all children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. in total, 486 aom episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. the treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of aom (irr 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (irr 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (irr = 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2). treatment was not associated with recurrent aom (odds ratio 1.0, 95% ci: 0.5-1.7). with regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. conclusion: the prob and preb included in follow-up formula given to children at  7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of aom, recurrent aom, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.

TI  == production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against listeria monocytogenes infection. in this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven  l. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain l. salivarius ucc118. this revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these  strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class iib bacteriocins. however, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. they ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin p, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin t, which is characterized in this study. salivaricin t inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little  homology to previously characterized salivaricins. interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin t activity, saltalpha and saltbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus. furthermore, the salivaricin  locus of strain dpc6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class iid  anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin l. these findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal l. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.

TI  == some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus la-k.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 mpa or less. it is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0,  3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 mpa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12, s. salivarius ssp.  thermophilus st-m5, and l. acidophilus la-k. the cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees c) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of  incubation. protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. all homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. a pressure of 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus st-m5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of l. acidophilus la-k but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. some low homogenization pressures  positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and l. acidophilus la-k. culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == inhibitory effect of yogurt on aberrant crypt foci formation in the rat colon and colorectal tumorigenesis in rash2 mice.
AB  == the inhibitory effects of yogurt consisting of milk fermented by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain 2038 and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain 1131 on formation of colonic aberrant crypt foci (acf) in rats and also on development of colorectal tumors in transgenic mice harboring human prototype c-ha-ras genes (rash2 mice) were examined. f344 rats and rash2 mice were fed commercial diet containing freeze-dried yogurt or starter medium (non-fermented milk). rats were inoculated orally with heterocyclic amine 2-amino-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine hydrochloride (phip) for two weeks. the rats were necropsied 14 days after the phip treatment, and acf in the colon and rectum were counted. rash2 mice were injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (dmh) for 20 weeks. three weeks after the last injection of dmh,  rash2 mice were necropsied to determine the number and the size of colorectal tumors. yogurt supplementation in diet significantly reduced the number of acf and aberrant crypts (acs) in rats fed control diet (p<0.01), but not in rats fed  non-fermented milk diet. on the other hand, rash2 mice receiving the yogurt-supplemented diet had significantly reduced numbers of tumors induced by dmh compared with those fed the non-fermented milk-supplemented diet (p<0.05). these results demonstrate that the yogurt used in this study appears to have tumor-suppressing properties, and rash2 mice are a useful model for the evaluation of antitumor activities of foods.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid content and organoleptic attributes of fermented milk products produced with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (cla), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. four probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and p. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures  (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus). the lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. l. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of cla. growth and cla formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed  with yogurt cultures. the fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor  as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == characterization of urease genes cluster of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: the milk acidification rate of streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. to evaluate the technological suitability of s. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to  urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain dsm 20167t. methods and results: amplification of the urease genes of s. thermophilus dsm 20167t was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related s. salivarius. nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureabc (structural genes) and urei, ureefgd (accessory genes) of s. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. reverse transcriptase pcr experiments were in agreement with  an operon organization for the eight genes (ureiabcefgd). a food grade mutant a16 (deltaurec3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in urec gene exhibited a urease negative (ure-) phenotype. unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. a small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using  the wild-type or the ure- mutant a16 (deltaurec3) in co-culture with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 in presence of urea. the result obtained underlines that when the ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. conclusions: the study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of s. thermophilus dsm 20617t urease activity. significance and impact of the study: the detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade ure- recombinant strain. small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a ure-s. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in  milk fermentations. moreover, the vector pmi108 developed for the construction of the ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of ure- dairy s. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.

TI  == the effect of temperature and ph on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a ph-auxostat study.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in traditional african yoghurt fermentation.
AB  == growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/-  0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c  for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but  not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that  of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the  spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca.  22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.

TI  == simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  == indisim, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. to this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. in the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. it was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of l.  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. an important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. in the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. the results of these  simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of  [lait 69 (1989) 519]. finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.

AB  == national and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. in venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some  commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. this research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. for this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. the  different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. these samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of ph and acidity. the absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. the succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. the data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.

AB  == background: although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. aim: to evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. patients and methods: twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-asa, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (vsl#3, csl, milan, italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. the following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. results: faecal concentrations of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (p<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. concentrations of bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (p = n.s.). fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. no significant side-effects have been reported. conclusions: these results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may  be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant  or allergic to 5-asa. controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.

TI  == starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  == the refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of lactobacillus fermentum, l. casei, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus,  and bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. during storage at 4 degrees c for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. after 28 days, the average numbers of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml, whereas those of l. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) cfu/ml. numbers of b. longum and l. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and l. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. the other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (p > 0.05) on the residual sugars. in most cases, l(+)-lactate predominated.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent dna damage in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. because the mechanisms responsible for these protective  effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. using the "comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that l. bulgaricus 191r applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced dna breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas st. thermophilus ch3 were not effective. however, in vitro, both strains  prevented dna damage induced by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in isolated primary rat colon cells. extracts prepared from milk fermented with st.  thermophilus ch3 were as efficient in deactivating mnng as was l-cysteine. isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [l(+) lactate, d(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. we postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which mnng or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  == yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. we recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (dmab) (mutation res. (1995) 334, 213-224). we are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against mnng.

AB  == it is generally agreed that the population of lactic acid bacteria in yogurt must be not less than 10(6) ufc/g. viability of the lactic flora until the end of shelf-life is affected for many factors, which has incidence in the recuperability of this microflora. mrs and lee agar were selected for the total count of lactic bacteria, the m17 was used for the s salivarius ssp thermophilus  and the rca for l. delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus. different methodologies were used  for detection and enumeration of this bacteria: direct plate count; thermal treatment and recuperation of the injured cells in soy tripticase broth. the enumeration was done at time zero and 3 hours after the start of the fermentative process and during storage at 4, 12 and 21 days. the results shown an excellent recuperability of the lactic flora in the selected media and methods that were used: however the enumeration was significatively lower in the rca agar. the counts in the lee agar shown a better recuperability. the thermal treatment affected negatively the counts of lactic flora and the repair method shown better results in the yogurt sample during storage. ph and acidity were determined at the beginning and during the storage period. it was observed a ph decrease because of the lactic acid production at the end of shelf-life.

AB  == the influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity and the cellular integrity of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus were tested. two strains (os 1 and os 2) of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and three strains (hc 15, 17, and 18) of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus were studied. in the presence of .15% oxgall, beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells of both species was significantly increased. however, at  a higher concentration (.3% oxgall), the beta-galactosidase activity was significantly less than in the presence of .15% oxgall. the presence of oxgall did not promote the cell lysis of any of the strains of either species. additionally, the presence of oxgall did not cause the leakage of the enzyme from the cells. thus, the presence of oxgall increased the cellular permeability to allow more substrate to enter the cells, thereby increasing beta-galactosidase activity, and, at higher concentrations, was inhibitory to beta-galactosidase activity of both species.

TI  == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.
