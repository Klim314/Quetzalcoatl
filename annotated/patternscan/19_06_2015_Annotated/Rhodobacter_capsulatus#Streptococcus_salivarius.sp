AB  == we present the cloning and sequencing of the ptsi gene, encoding enzyme i (ei) of the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): sugar phosphotransferase (pts) transport system from streptococcus salivarius. the ptsi gene corresponds to an open reading frame of 1731 nucleotides, which translates into a putative 577-amino acid (aa) protein with a m(r) of 62,948 and a pi of 4.49. the ei was produced in escherichia coli under the control of its own promoter located immediately upstream of ptsi, a situation never previously reported for any other gene coding for an ei. the deduced aa sequence of the s. salivarius ei shows a high degree of similarity with the e. coli ei and the ei moiety of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein from rhodobacter capsulatus. the s. salivarius ei also shares a highly conserved  aa cluster with a non-pts protein, the maize pyruvate:orthophosphate dikinase. the conserved cluster is located in a domain which is hypothesized to be the pep-binding site.
