TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (bacteroides, gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., eikenella corrodens) and two control species (streptococcus intermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa) were  selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (pvp-i) aqueous solution in vitro. the pvp-i solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50,  100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. the strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous pvp-i for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.
