TI  - Haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16S  ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
AB  - This paper reports a case of Haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of H. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. In the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with Streptococcus intermedius and S. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. In the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with Clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. Both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress C in air with CO2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. Both strains were factor V-dependent, but not factor X-dependent. For the first isolate, the Vitek system (NHI) showed that it was 56% likely to be Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% Neisseria subflava; whereas the API system (NH) showed that it was 58% likely to be H. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% H. parainfluenzae. For the second isolate, the Vitek system (NHI) showed that it was 95% likely to be H. influenzae VIII; whereas the API system (NH) showed that it was 58% likely to be H. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% H. parainfluenzae. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and H. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and H. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of H. segnis. Only two cases of H. segnis bacteraemia were found in the English scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. Including the present two cases, the overall mortality of H. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - Detection of the tetM determinant in Neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  - Three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetM sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the DIG-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Only Probe 3, 5'-GCT CAA CAA TTC TGT TCC AGC-3', was specific for tetM. It hybridized with the tetM-containing 25.2-MDa plasmids from all of the 232 TRNG and the 130 PP/TRNG isolates used in the study. Its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pJ13 plasmid DNA or 10(4) cells. It did not hybridize with the DNA from non-PPNG, CMRNG and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other Neisseria species (N. meningitidis, N. subflava, N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. sicca, N. mucosa, and N. flavescens), Moraxella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. Probe 3 also hybridized to DNA of three tetracycline resistant P. magnus (MIC = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetM determinant. Therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for TRNG, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetM determinant.
TI  - Production and characterisation of mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive with the  lipopolysaccharide core of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the core antigen region of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were produced from mice immunised with whole cells of heat-killed rough mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing partial or complete core LPS. MAbs were screened in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against three different antigen cocktails: S-form LPS from three P. aeruginosa strains, R-form LPS from six P. aeruginosa strains and, as a negative control, R-form LPS from Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Selected MAbs were subsequently screened against a range of extracted LPS and whole cells from both reference strains and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The antibodies were also screened in ELISA against whole-cell antigens from other Pseudomonas spp. as well as strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria subflava and Staphylococcus aureus. Five MAbs reacting with the core component of P. aeruginosa LPS were finally selected. Two of these, MAbs 360.7 and 304.1.4, were particularly reactive in immunoblots against unsubstituted core LPS, including that from O-antigenic serotypes of P. aeruginosa. The MAbs also reacted with some of the other Pseudomonas spp., but not with P. cepacia or Xanthomonas (Pseudomonas) maltophilia. Cross-reactivity with whole cells from other bacterial species was minimal or not observed. Reactivity of MAbs with some Staph. aureus strains was observed, and binding to the protein A component was implicated. The reactivity of the MAbs was investigated further by flow cytometry and immunogold electronmicroscopy. The suitability of the MAbs for an immunological assay for detection of P. aeruginosa in respiratory secretions from CF patients is discussed.
TI  - Frequent isolation of capnophilic bacteria in aspirate from Bartholin's gland abscesses and cysts.
AB  - Aspirate samples were obtained from 73 patients undergoing surgery for a Bartholin's gland abscess or cyst. Capnophilic bacteria were isolated from 22% of cases, in contrast to previous reports of sporadic isolation. The three Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were serotype 3 or 4. The eight Haemophilus influenzae isolates could not be serotyped; six of them were biotype II but the electrophoretic band patterns of their outer membrane proteins were heterogeneous, indicating that non-serotypable strains from the same anatomical site may not be related. Four Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates and one strain of Neisseria subflava were recovered. The role of capnophilic bacteria in the pathogenesis of infections of the Bartholin's gland remains to be clarified.
TI  - Nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  - Binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. Suspensions of Veillonella parvula and Haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing Neisseria subflava or Streptococcus sanguis. The maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. This ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. These results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.
