TI  == identification of unknown ocular pathogens in clinically suspected eye infections using ribosomal rna gene sequence analysis.
AB  == dna sequence-based identification of pathogens from ocular samples of patients with clinically suspected eye infections was accomplished using 16s and internal  transcribed spacer (its) ribosomal rna gene sequence analysis. pcr was positive for 24 of 99 samples tested. both culture and 16s rdna sequence analysis identified pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococci and enterobacteriaceae. isolates  misidentified as burkholderia cepacia by biochemical tests were identified as ralstonia mannitolilytica by 16s rdna sequence analysis. sequence analysis identified the following microorganisms from 19 culture-negative samples: haemophilus influenzae, sphingomonas sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus haemolyticus, morganella morganii, mycobacterium sp., chryseobacterium sp., pseudomonas saccharophila (xanthomonas) and the fungus, phaeoacremonium inflatipes.

TI  == neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  == aim: to analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. methods: seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. results: of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). the most common gram-negative organisms were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. to the gram-negative organisms, the  most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. conclusions: the most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium  identified.

TI  == the binding of mbl to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  == objective: to purify mannan-binding lectin (mbl) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. methods: mbl was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-sepharose 4b column. its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ella). results: mbl has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to klebsiella ornithinolytica and escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus epidermidis. to different isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus, mbl shows quite different binding ability. conclusions: mbl has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to gram-negative bacteria.  its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.
