TI  == the effects of airway microbiome on corticosteroid responsiveness in asthma.
AB  == rationale: the role of airway microbiome in corticosteroid response in asthma is  unknown. objectives: to examine airway microbiome composition in patients with corticosteroid-resistant (cr) asthma and compare it with patients with corticosteroid-sensitive (cs) asthma and normal control subjects and explore whether bacteria in the airways of subjects with asthma may direct alterations in cellular responses to corticosteroids. methods: 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) samples of 39 subjects with asthma and  12 healthy control subjects. in subjects with asthma, corticosteroid responsiveness was characterized, bal macrophages were stimulated with pathogenic versus commensal microorganisms, and analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for the expression of corticosteroid-regulated genes and cellular p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) activation. measurements and main results: of the 39 subjects with asthma, 29 were cr and 10 were cs. bal microbiome from subjects with cr and cs asthma did not differ in richness, evenness, diversity, and community composition at the phylum level, but did differ at the genus level, with distinct genus expansions in 14 subjects with cr  asthma. preincubation of asthmatic airway macrophages with haemophilus parainfluenzae, a uniquely expanded potential pathogen found only in cr asthma airways, resulted in p38 mapk activation, increased il-8 (p < 0.01), mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase 1 mrna (p < 0.01) expression, and inhibition of corticosteroid responses (p < 0.05). this was not observed after exposure to commensal bacterium prevotella melaninogenica. inhibition of transforming growth  factor-beta-associated kinase-1 (tak1), upstream activator of mapk, but not p38 mapk restored cellular sensitivity to corticosteroids. conclusions: a subset of subjects with cr asthma demonstrates airway expansion of specific gram-negative bacteria, which trigger tak1/mapk activation and induce corticosteroid resistance. tak1 inhibition restored cellular sensitivity to corticosteroids.

TI  == head and neck space infections in infants and children.
AB  == a retrospective study was performed in 117 children with head and neck space infections treated at the children's hospital of pittsburgh from january 1986 through june 1992. peritonsillar space infections were the most common (49%), followed by retropharyngeal (22%), submandibular (14%), buccal (11%), parapharyngeal (2%), and canine (2%) space infections. the most common pathogens  isolated (n = 78) were the aerobes beta-hemolytic streptococcus (18%) and staphylococcus aureus (18%), the anaerobes bacteroides melaninogenicus (17%) and  veillonella (14%), and the gram-negative organism haemophilus parainfluenzae (14%). beta-lactamase production by aerobic pathogens was detected in 22% of cultures. computed tomography scans (n = 16) were reviewed in blinded fashion and compared with operative findings. the sensitivity of computed tomography scan in  detecting the presence of an abscess vs. cellulitis was high (91%), whereas the specificity was rather low (60%). treatment of head and neck space infections in  children should consist of accurate physical diagnosis aided by imaging studies,  empiric antibiotic therapy that covers gram-negative and beta-lactamase--producing organisms as well as gram-positive organisms and anaerobes, and timely surgical intervention, when indicated.
