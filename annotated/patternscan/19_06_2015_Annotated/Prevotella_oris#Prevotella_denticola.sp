TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the n. n. blokhin cancer research center, moscow, russia.
AB  == in total 122 non-duplicate bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. most of the strains belonged to the b. fragilis group (55%), followed by prevotella strains (34.4%) and fusobacterium spp (10.6%). the species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. the most common isolates were b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b.  ovatus and b. vulgatus. among prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were p. buccae, p. buccalis, p. oris, p. denticola and p. nigrescens, and most of the fusobacterium spp. were f. nucleatum. susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the e-test methodology. the percentage of the susceptibility of b. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (mic </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (mic </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (mic </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (mic </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. three b. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). all prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (mic >0.5 mug/ml). the susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. all fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.

TI  == age-dependent changes in porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species/phylotypes in healthy gingiva and inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites.
AB  == objectives: early colonisation of oral surfaces by periodontal pathogens presents a significant risk factor for subsequent development of destructive disease affecting tissues that support the dentition. the aims of the present study were  to establish the age-dependent relationship between sub-gingival profiles of 22 prevotella species/phylotypes in children, adolescents and adults from an isolated aboriginal community and, further, to use this information to identify prevotella species that could serve as microbial risk indicators. materials and methods: dna isolated from sub-gingival plaque samples (three healthy sites and three inflamed/diseased sites) from adults, adolescents and children was screened for porphyromonas gingivalis load and 22 prevotella species/phylotypes by species-specific pcr. results: a noticeable feature in adolescents was the marked increase in colonisation by p. gingivalis across all test sites. the mean number  of prevotella species/phylotypes colonising inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites  increased with age. progressive partitioning of selected prevotella species/phylotypes to healthy or inflamed/diseased sites was evident. prevalence  of prevotella intermedia, prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 and prevotella oris increased significantly with age in diseased sites. similarly, significant age-dependent increase in colonisation of healthy as well as inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites was apparent for prevotella oralis, prevotella multiformis, prevotella denticola, prevotella strain p4p_53 and prevotella oral clone br014. conclusion: early colonisation of children by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 provides indication of risk for subsequent development of periodontal disease. clinical relevance: in the present study, the complexity of prevotella species within gingival sites is explored as a basis for evaluating contribution of prevotella species to disease.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == genetic relationships within the genus prevotella analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == the genetic diversity and relationships within the genus prevotella were studied  by analyzing twenty-five strains by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee) at nine metabolic enzyme loci and dna-dna hybridization. mlee revealed a high genetic diversity with 25 electrophoretic types (ets) for the 25 strains studied, a mean number of alleles per enzyme locus of 6.8 and a mean genetic diversity per locus of 0.786. the index of association described by maynard smith et al. (1993) revealed a clonal structure within the genus prevotella. a dendrogram generated by cluster analysis of a matrix of ets showed that species like p. bivia, p. buccae, p. oris, p. oralis, p. nigrescens, and p. denticola form clusters that are consistent with dna homologies. however, strains identified as p. melaninogenica or p. loescheii by dna-dna hybridization did not constitute distinct subpopulations in mlee. mlee analysis demonstrated its high power in differentiating closely related strains. it provides an alternative to 16s rrna analysis for the study of phylogenetic relationships within the genus prevotella, especially for differentiating strains with high dna homology or high rrna homology.

TI  == inhibition of prevotella and capnocytophaga immunoglobulin a1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  == oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin  a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p.  oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these  finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing  antibodies.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  == bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; p < .001). infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; p < .05). eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium species, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella oris were frequently isolated. streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas corynebacterium species, prevotella denticola, capnocytophaga species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented prevotella species.
AB  == collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (ctrps) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. pms and ctrp classifications were compared with a previous  classification based on visual analysis of sds-page patterns. although the order  of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. cluster membership in the pms classification correlated particularly well with sds-page results. ctrp clusters  corresponded largely to the recognised species of prevotella, but pms and sds-page divided two species into sub-groups: two in p. buccae and five in p. veroralis. the latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in ctrps. an undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of p. buccae strains in pms and ctrps. b. (p.) capillus could not be distinguished from p. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. strains of p. zoogleoformans and b. (p.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in pms. a complex comprising clusters of p. disiens, p. oralis, p. veroralis, p. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to p. melaninogenica was well differentiated from p. buccae and p. oris in pms; clusters corresponding to p. bivia, p. corporis, p. intermedia and p. denticola formed another complex.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == the use of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  == bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. these two groups are represented by the type strain of the species atcc 25611t (b. intermedius type i) and by atcc 33563 (b. intermedius type ii). members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and by dna-dna homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. the purpose of this study was to prepare specific dna probes for the two groups of bacteroides intermedius and  to test them against field isolates. whole-cell dna probes were prepared from b.  intermedius types i and ii and tested against 253 field strains of bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as b. intermedius. of  these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the b. intermedius type i dna probe, 28 (11%) with the type ii, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the b. intermedius probes but  did hybridize with either b. melaninogenicus, b. loescheii, or b. corporis whole-cell dna probes. the 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five bacteroides probes or with probes to b. asaccharolyticus, b. buccae, b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. gingivalis, b. oralis, or b. oris. these data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.

TI  == use of the rapid-ana system to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited bacteroides.
AB  == the rapid-ana system (innovative diagnostics systems, inc., atlanta, ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited bacteroides from humans. bacteroides oris, bacteroides veroralis, bacteroides buccalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, and bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. clear differentiation of these six species by the rapid-ana system was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. bacteroides oralis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. no consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two dna homology groups within bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, or bacteroides intermedius. tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, n-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.
