TI  == inflammatory response of haemophilus influenzae biotype aegyptius causing brazilian purpuric fever.
AB  == the brazilian purpuric fever (bpf) is a systemic disease with many clinical features of meningococcal sepsis and is usually preceded by purulent conjunctivitis. the illness is caused by haemophilus influenza biogroup aegyptius, which was associated exclusively with conjunctivitis. in this work construction of the las gene, hypothetically responsible for this virulence, were fusioned with ermam cassette in neisseria meningitidis virulent strains and had its dna transfer to non bpf h. influenzae strains. the effect of the las transfer was capable to increase the cytokines tnfalpha and il10 expression in hec-1b cells line infected with these transformed mutants (in eight log scale of folding change rna expression). this is the first molecular study involving the las transfer to search an elucidation of the pathogenic factors by horizontal intergeneric transfer from meningococci to h. influenzae.

TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae filamentous phage ngophi6 is capable of infecting a variety of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we constructed a phagemid consisting of the whole genome of the neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteriophage ngophi6 cloned into a pbluescript plasmid derivative lacking the f1 origin of replication (named pbs::phi6). escherichia coli cells harboring pbs::phi6 were able to produce a biologically active phagemid, ngophi6fm, capable of infecting, integrating its dna into the chromosome of, and  producing progeny phagemids in, a variety of taxonomically distant gram-negative  bacteria, including e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens. a derivative of pbs::phi6 lacking the phage orf7 gene, a positional homolog of filamentous phage proteins that mediate the interaction between the phage and the bacterial pilus, was capable of producing phagemid particles that were able to infect e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, n. sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens, indicating that ngophi6 infects cells of these species using a mechanism that does not involve the orf7 gene product and that ngophi6 initiates infection through a novel process in these species. we further demonstrate that the establishment of the lysogenic state does not require an active phage integrase. since phagemid particles were capable of infecting diverse hosts, this indicates that ngophi6 is the first broad-host-range filamentous bacteriophage described.

TI  == epidemiologic pattern of meningococcal meningitis in northern cameroon in 2007-2010: contribution of pcr-enhanced surveillance.
AB  == objectives: monitoring acute bacterial meningitis in northern cameroon. methods:  health professionals collected cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from patients  presenting with clinical symptoms of meningitis. specimens were tested using gram stain, latex agglutination test, and culture. a pcr assay completed the diagnostic testing. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was performed on some neisseria meningitidis (nm) isolates. results: from 2007 through 2010, of the 1429 csf specimens tested, 292 (20.4%) were positive, either for nm (205), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) (57), or haemophilus influenzae (hi) (30). from 2007 through 2009, the serogroup w135 represented 98.8% of 164 case isolates. until 2008, most serogroup w135 isolates presented the sequence-type st-2881 usually associated with sporadic cases. since 2009, the st-11 (an epidemic-associated clone) became predominant, although no epidemic occurred. serogroup a st-7 was observed in 2010 and caused a localized epidemic. using the  detection pcr on turbid csf, a 2.7-fold increase in cases with etiologic diagnosis was obtained, compared to culture. all tested meningococcal isolates (42) were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cefotaxim. conclusions: resurgence of serogroup a and recent increase in st-11 among serogroup w135 isolates were worrying when considered with the epidemic wave of serogroup a meningitis, which affected neighboring countries and the serogroup w135 epidemic  in niger in 2009-2010.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo profiles of ach-702, an isothiazoloquinolone, against bacterial pathogens.
AB  == ach-702, a novel isothiazoloquinolone (itq), was assessed for antibacterial activity against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and found to possess broad-spectrum activity, especially against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive strains, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). for gram-negative bacteria, ach-702 showed exceptional potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and a neisseria sp. but was less active against members of the enterobacteriaceae. good antibacterial activity was also evident against several anaerobes as well as legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. excellent bactericidal activity was observed for ach-702 against several bacterial pathogens in time-kill assays, and postantibiotic effects (paes) of >1 h were evident with both laboratory and clinical strains of  staphylococci at 10 x mic and similar in most cases to those observed for moxifloxacin at the same mic multiple. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated against  s. aureus with murine sepsis and thigh infection models, with decreases in the number of cfu/thigh equal to or greater than those observed after vancomycin treatment. macromolecular synthesis assays showed specific dose-dependent inhibition of dna replication in staphylococci, and biochemical analyses indicated potent dual inhibition of two essential dna replication enzymes: dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. additional biological data in support of an effective dual targeting mechanism of action include the following: low mic values (</=0.25 mug/ml) against staphylococcal strains with single mutations in both gyra and grla (parc), retention of good antibacterial activity (mics of </=0.5 mug/ml) against staphylococcal strains with two mutations in both gyra and grla, and low frequencies for the selection of higher-level resistance (<10(-)(1)(0)). these promising initial data support further study of isothiazoloquinolones as potential clinical candidates.

TI  == [the role of lactoferrin in the iron metabolism. part ii. antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effect of lactoferrin by chelation of iron].
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is a glycoprotein widely distributed in mammalian organisms. it  is synthesized by epithelial cells; hence it is present in secretions of mucous membranes. it is also contained in secondary granules of neutrophils and released to the circulation during trauma, infection or inflammation. lf belongs to the transferrin family--proteins binding iron ions with a high affinity. upon isolation in 1961 lf was initially called a red, iron-binding protein. lf's ability to bind iron is associated with other functions which the protein fulfils in the body. as described in the part i. of the article, lf participates in acquisition of iron from food and its storage in the body, and to a certain degree also in iron transport to cells. in this part of the article the effect of lf in combating microorganisms by chelating iron is described. the iron-chelating property of lf renders iron inaccessible to the pathogens, thus restricting their growth. iron, due to its participation in many metabolic processes, is an essential element for almost all microorganisms. iron is not easily accessible for pathogens within the host. since iron is crucial for normal function of both  pathogens and the host, an ability to acquire iron during infection is regarded as an important virulence factor. higher vertebrates have evolved a complicated protection system of iron storage and lf is an important element of this system.  low iron-saturated lf effectively combats bacteria and fungi, acting in a bacteriostatic and fungistatic way. the degree of iron saturation also influences antiviral activity of lf. some pathogens (e.g. helicobacter pylori, neisseria sp, haemophilus influenzae) have evolved a system of siderophores or cellular receptors which can acquire iron from lf and transferrin. the so-called lactoferrin theory of hypoferremia in inflammation assumes, in addition, a protective role of the protein in inflammation, sepsis and trauma. lf, by chelation and storage of plasma iron in the liver and spleen, temporarily restricts its accessibility for microorganisms and processes of formation of toxic, reactive oxygen species, which contributes to the amelioration of inflammatory states.

TI  == comparison of dot-elisa and standard elisa for detection of neisseria meningitidis outer membrane complex-specific antibodies.
AB  == dot-elisa using the outer membrane complex antigens of neisseria meningitidis as  a target was standardized for rapid detection of meningococcal-specific antibodies in human serum. we investigated the level of meningococcal-specific igg, iga, and igm in serum using dot-elisa with outer membrane antigens prepared  from neisseria meningitidis serotype b:4.19:p1.15,3,7,9 (a strain isolated from a brazilian epidemic). the dot-elisa is based on the same principles as the standard elisa and is useful for detection of anti-n. meningitidis b antibodies in serum of patients with meningococcal infections. for the assay, outer membrane complexes (omcs) were absorbed by nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with a 5% skim milk solution. serum samples were drawn upon hospital admission and during convalescence from patients with meningococcal septicemia, and single samples were drawn from uninfected controls. we retrospectively examined a total of 57 serum samples: 35 from patients infected with n. meningitidis b, 12 from patients infected with haemophilus influenzae b, and 10 from health individuals. when performed at room temperature, dot-elisa took approximately four hours to perform, and the optimum antigen concentration was 0.42 microg per dot. the specificity of igg, igm, and iga demonstrates that dot-elisa using omcs from n. meningitidis b as a target is suitable for serologic verification of clinically suspected meningococcal disease in patients and for titer determination of antibodies produced during different phases of natural infection. furthermore, the sensitivity of dot-elisa was comparable to that of standard elisa. overall, dot-elisa is simple to perform, rapid, and low cost. further validation of the test as a screening tool is required.

TI  == [effectiveness of a polymerase chain reaction using seminested and multiplex strategy for the identification of the three main bacteria responsible for meningitis in burkina faso].
AB  == a prospective study (from august 2006 to april 2007) was carried out with 214 cerebrospinal fluid samples with suspicion of bacterial meningitis. the aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the simultaneous detection of neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus sp. and haemophilus influenzae using seminested polymerase chain reaction strategy. among the 214 samples tested by both pcr and culture, the overall confirmation rate was 64% for pcr and 40.1% for culture (p = 2 x 10(-)(6)). taking culture method as the standard reference, the  overall sensitivity of pcr was 98.8% and specificity, 59.4%. the sensitivity of pcr was 100, 97.3 and 100% respectively for n. meningitidis, streptococcus sp. and h. influenzae with respective specificities of 70, 93.2 and 97.2%. in conclusion, the seminested pcr strategy is a sensitive method and it can be implemented in the reference public health laboratories for an exhaustive microbiological surveillance of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [antibiotic management of pediatric presumptive bacterial meningitis (rational, methods, course, and follow-up)].
AB  == the epidemiology of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis in children in  industrialized nations was greatly modified because of recommended vaccination against haemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) and in some countries against neisseria meningitidis (nm) group c. however, most cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by sp and nm most frequently group b, which validates the first intention use of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone combined or not with vancomycin according to the probability of pneumococcal resistance.

TI  == the dape-encoded n-succinyl-l,l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase from haemophilus influenzae contains two active-site histidine residues.
AB  == the catalytic and structural properties of the h67a and h349a dape-encoded n-succinyl-l,l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (dape) from haemophilus influenzae were investigated. on the basis of sequence alignment with the carboxypeptidase from pseudomonas sp. strain rs-16, both h67 and h349 were predicted to be zn(ii) ligands. the h67a dape enzyme exhibited a decreased catalytic efficiency (180-fold) compared with wild-type (wt) dape towards n-succinyldiaminopimelic acid. no catalytic activity was observed for h349a under the experimental conditions used. the electronic paramagnetic resonance (epr) and electronic absorption data indicate that the co(ii) ion bound to h349a-dape is analogous to that of wt dape after the addition of a single co(ii) ion. the addition of 1 equiv of co(ii) to h67a dape provides spectra that are very different from those of the first co(ii) binding site of the wt enzyme, but that  are similar to those of the second binding site. the epr and electronic absorption data, in conjunction with the kinetic data, are consistent with the assignment of h67 and h349 as active-site metal ligands for the dape from h. influenzae. furthermore, the data suggest that h67 is a ligand in the first metal binding site, while h349 resides in the second metal binding site. a three-dimensional homology structure of the dape from h. influenzae was generated using the x-ray crystal structure of the dape from neisseria meningitidis as a template and superimposed on the structure of the aminopeptidase from aeromonas proteolytica (aap). this homology structure confirms the assignment of h67 and h349 as active-site ligands. the superimposition of the homology model of dape with the dizinc(ii) structure of aap indicates that within 4.0 a of the zn(ii) binding sites of aap all of the amino acid residues of dape are nearly identical.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis among children, in manhica, a rural area in southern mozambique.
AB  == introduction: acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is one of the most severe diseases in sub-saharan africa. although data for the continent is very limited, more than one million cases are estimated per year, with mortality and life-long sequelae occurring in 50% of these cases. methods: as part of the clinical management of children admitted to the manhica district hospital, information on cases of abm was recorded. we analysed data from june 1998 to november 2003. results: during the study period, 475 cerebrospinal-fluid (csf) samples were collected from 20,173 children <15 years of age admitted to hospital. culture results confirmed  71 (15%) cases of abm. the most prevalent bacterial aetiologies were streptotoccus pneumoniae (pneumococcus, n=31), haemophilus influenzae (n=13) and  neisseria meningitis (n=8). other important bacteria were streptococcus sp. (n=7), salmonella sp. (n=4) and staphylococcus aureus (n=3). crude incidence rates of abm and pneumococcal meningitis were 20/100,000 and 10/100,000 children-year-at-risk, respectively. incidences were more than three times higher in the <1 year age group. overall case fatality rate was 36%, and was highest for h. influenzae and pneumococcal meningitis (55% and 45%, respectively, p=0.044). pneumococcal susceptibility was 81% for oxacillin and 93% for chloramphenicol. for h. influenzae isolates, susceptibility was 54% for ampicillin and 62% for chloramphenicol. conclusions: s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae are the main aetiologies responsible for the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with abm in rural mozambique. these findings are important to evaluate treatment  guidelines and potential impact of control measures.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis at the 'complexe pediatrique' of bangui, central african republic.
AB  == to precis the aetiologies of children meningitis and the susceptibility to antibiotics of bacteria responsible for meningitis in bangui, we conducted a prospective study between october 2004 and september 2005, at the 'complexe pediatrique de bangui', central african republic (car). children from 1 day to 16 years with suspected meningitis and who underwent a lumbar puncture were enrolled. gram staining, culture on chocolate blood medium, cell count, biochemistry (protein level, glucose ratio), capsular antigen detection were performed for each cerebrospinal fluid. mics were determined by the e-test method. four hundred and seventeen patients were enrolled during the study period; 130 were proven acute bacterial meningitis and 37 probable bacterial meningitis. among proven bacterial meningitis, streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism responsible for meningitis (62 cases, 48%) followed by haemophilus influenzae (46 cases, 35%) and by neisseria meningitidis and salmonella sp. (8 cases, 6% each). ninety-four percent and 96% of s. pneumoniae strains tested remain susceptible to benzylpenicilline and chloramphenicol, respectively. a beta-lactamase was detected in 92% of h. influenzae strains tested. however, mics 50% and 90% for amoxicillin were found to be 1 and 4 mg/l,  respectively and 33% of these strains were resistant to chloramphenicol. the global mortality rate was 35% (59/167). this mortality rate was 47% for s. pneumoniae, 33% for h. influenzae, 62% for salmonella sp. and 13% for n. meningitidis. the probabilistic treatment with ampicillin and chloramphenicol usually administered for children meningitis in bangui must be reconsidered particularly in cases of h. influenzae meningitis. it is of importance to reduce  the presentation delays of children with suspected meningitis in bangui. the h. influenzae b immunization would allow a dramatic reduction of meningitis cases and deaths in central african children.

TI  == intranasal vaccines for protection against respiratory and systemic bacterial infections.
AB  == more than 4 million deaths per year are due to respiratory diseases. although licensed vaccines are available, bacteria, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, bordetella pertussis and neisseria meningiditis, among others, continue to be the major agents of diseases in young children, the elderly and/or immunocompromized individuals. following respiratory tract infection, some microorganisms may also invade the epithelial tissue, achieving systemic circulation and/or other organs. nasal administration  of different antigen formulations has shown promising results in the induction of immune responses and the defeat of the pathogens at the site of infection. this review will focus on the main nasal vaccine strategies and technologies being investigated against the most common infections caused by respiratory bacteria.

TI  == bacterial profile and clinical outcome of childhood meningitis in rural yemen: a  2-year hospital-based study.
AB  == background: childhood acute bacterial meningitis (abm) is an important cause of death and long-term neurological disability in yemen, the only low income-high mortality country in the arabian peninsula. the objective of this study was to document the microbial characteristics, the antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and the outcome for children hospitalized with abm, prior to the introduction of  haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine in yemen. patients and methods: the study was retrospective, conducted at a rural district hospital, serving the rural population of the northern parts of yemen. all patients aged 1 month-15 years admitted between may 1999 and june 2001, with clinical evidence of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) cultured, were included in the study. clinical information from case notes, including csf result and the outcome on discharge, were obtained. analysis of extracted data was performed using epi info software. results: during the 2-year study period, 160 study patients met the inclusion criteria, and 7 (4.4%) were negative for bacterial growth. in the 153 positive cultures there were 46 (30.1%) streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), 23 (15%) h. influenzae (hi), 81 (52.9) neisseria meningitidis (nm), 2 (1.3%) staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and 1 (0.7%) escherichia coli. sixteen study patients died (overall case fatality rate (cfr) 10%), 7 aged under 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 3 more than 60 months. ten deaths were due to sp meningitis, 2 hi meningitis, 3 nm meningitis, and 1 had s. aureus. of the 144 survivors, 28 (19.4%) developed permanent neurological complications, 17 aged less than 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 5 more than 60 months. sp meningitis accounted for 57.1% (16/28), and 6 (21.4%) had hi meningitis. among the 89 aged 1-60 months, 13 died (cfr 14.6%), and 23 (30.3%) of the 76 survivors  developed permanent complications. of those tested 20% and 35% of the 20 hi tested isolates and 9.5% and 14.3% of the 42 sp isolates, were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin g, respectively, and the majority of the 81 nm isolates were sensitive to both. the 3 pathogens were largely resistant to gentamicin, and almost all were susceptible to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. conclusion: in contrast to the studies from the low-mortality countries of the region, our study showed that the predominant pathogens of childhood abm were sp and nm. sp meningitis was associated with increased mortality and permanent disability.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

AB  == to clarify the bacteriological interpretation of nasopharyngeal flora from infants and children with influenza (n = 38), nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. from 38 patients, 83 strains of bacterias were obtained. chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children with influenza were b. catarrhalis (28 strains), s. pneumoniae (22 strains), h. influenzae (19 strains), s. aureus (6 strains) and chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children with influenza were corynebacterium spp. and alpha-streptococcus (3 strains each) and moraxella sp (2 strains). from infants and children without influenza (n = 34), 83 strains were obtained. the chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children without influenza were b. catarrhalis (23 strains), h. influenzae (22 strains), s. pneumoniae (18 strains), s. aureus (7 strains) and chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from infants and children without influenza were corynebacterium spp. and moraxella sp (5 strains each), alpha-streptococcus  (2 strains) and neisseria sp (1 strain). there was no significant difference in nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and infants and  children without influenza. in cases showing detection of multiple bacterial strains, common combinations were one or more of b. catarrhalis, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, s. aureus and nonpathogenic or weakly pathogenic bacteria. there was also no significant difference in combinations of nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and those without influenza. we emphasize that we must study whether a difference in nasopharyngeal flora between infants and children with influenza and infants and children without influenza develops with time. therefore, we must repeatedly obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from infants and children with influenza and infants and children without influenza.

TI  == the haemophilus influenzae hia autotransporter contains an unusually short trimeric translocator domain.
AB  == gram-negative bacterial autotransporter proteins are a growing group of virulence factors that are characterized by their ability to cross the outer membrane without the help of accessory proteins. a conserved c-terminal beta-domain is critical for targeting of autotransporters to the outer membrane and for translocation of the n-terminal "passenger" domain to the bacterial surface. we have demonstrated previously that the haemophilus influenzae hia adhesin belongs  to the autotransporter family, with translocator activity residing in the c-terminal 319 residues. to gain further insight into the mechanism of autotransporter protein translocation, we performed a structure-function analysis on hia. in initial experiments, we generated a series of in-frame deletions and a set of chimeric proteins containing varying regions of the hia c terminus fused to a heterologous passenger domain and discovered that the final 76 residues of hia are both necessary and sufficient for translocation. analysis by flow cytometry revealed that the region n-terminal to this shortened translocator domain is surface localized, further suggesting that this region is not involved  in beta-barrel formation or in translocation of the passenger domain. western analysis demonstrated that the translocation-competent regions of the c terminus  migrated at masses consistent with trimers, suggesting that the hia c terminus oligomerizes. furthermore, fusion proteins containing a heterologous passenger domain demonstrated that similarly small c-terminal regions of yersinia sp. yada  and neisseria meningitidis nhha are translocation-competent. these data provide experimental support for a unique subclass of autotransporters characterized by a short trimeric translocator domain.

AB  == to clarify the bacteriological interpretation of flora in the nasopharynx of highly aged patients (n = 107), healthy nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from subjects of advanced age. chief pathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were coagulase negative staphylococcus (43 strains), corynebacterium spp. (14 strains), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production and non-production) (16 strains), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase production) (6 strains). chief nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from highly aged persons were alpha-streptococcus (14 strains), neisseria sp (3 strains). streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis which are the chief bacteria isolated from children, demonstrated only 3 strains for each bacteria. in cases showing detection of multiple detected bacteria, common combinations were non-pathogenic bacteria and  weakly pathogenic bacteria and enteric bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. the differences between nasopharyngeal flora of children and highly aged persons are  suspected to be due to the differences in immunological and anatomical factors. we should actively examine these factors in highly aged subjects.

TI  == production and characterization of a new monoclonal antibody against neisseria meningitidis: study of the cross-reactivity with different bacterial genera.
AB  == we have generated a hybridoma cell line which produces an 8c7br1 clone of the igm antibody isotype. it recognizes the 50-, 65-, and 60-kda antigens and is reactive with strains of n. meningitidis in the 98% of local neisseria genera by dot-elisa assays. two percent of the strains of n. meningitidis b do not present reactivity with the 8c7br1 monoclonal antibody (mab). the antibody reacted against n. meningitidis of serogroups a, b, c, x, y, z, and different serotypes and subtypes of n. meningitidis b and c by means of dot-elisa and immunoblot. it cross-reacted with neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica, haemophilus influenzae type b, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, bordetella pertussis, and bacillus subtilis. the 8c7br1 mab reacted with the 65-kda protein present in the prototype meningococcal strains b:16:b6(b2a:p1.5.2) and 2996 (b2b:p1.5.2). in h. influenzae type b, e. coli and b. subtilis, the mab  recognized the protein of 60, 65, and 70 kda, respectively. facs analysis showed  that 8c7brl mab could recognize the 50-kda protein on the surface of n. meningitidis homologous (b:4:p1.9) strain. these results, together with the bactericidal activity of 8c7br1, and an experiment of passive protection in mice, demonstrated the potential importance of the cross-reactive protein as a candidate antigen for n. meningitidis b vaccine composition.

TI  == microbiology of the middle meatus: a comparison between normal adults and children.
AB  == middle meatal samples were obtained from 52 carefully selected healthy adults. in 75 per cent of the test subjects bacterial organisms were cultured. however, growth was often poor and the predominant species suggest a commensal flora: coagulase-negative staphylococci were retrieved from 35 per cent, corynebacterium sp. from 23 per cent and staphyloccus aureus from eight per cent of the adults. these data are very different from those previously obtained among children where--even in the absence of obvious ent pathology--the most frequently cultured organisms were typical sinusitis pathogens: haemophilus influenzae present in 40  per cent, moraxella catarrhalis in 34 per cent and streptococcus pneumoniae in 50 per cent of children. furthermore, streptococcus viridans and neisseria sp., both organisms that might be able to inhibit colonization by some of the pathogens and found commonly among children, are virtually absent in healthy adults.

TI  == designing meningitis vaccines.
AB  == conjugate polysaccharide vaccines are a recent intervention to combat the relative inability of young children to mount an effective immune response against encapsulated bacteria, especially haemophilus influenzae (hib), neisseria meningitidis (nm) and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp). these organisms cause the majority of community acquired septicaemia and meningitis in uk children. their capsular polysaccharides, important virulence factors in evading phagocytosis, are poorly immunogenic in young children compared to adults. conjugation, by covalent linking, of the polysaccharide to an immunogenic protein, has been demonstrated for each of these organisms to produce good antibody response to the polysaccharide. conjugate hib vaccines have proven effective in reducing hib meningitis and invasive disease in the countries that have introduced them. pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have proven effective in preventing invasive disease caused by serotypes contained in the vaccines. efficacy studies are awaited for meningococcal conjugate vaccines.

AB  == forty-two protein spots of observed m(r) 6-15 kda were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained by coomassie blue and subjected to edman microsequencing. all of the proteins could be related back to their encoding open reading frames, thereby vindicating the bioinformatic tools currently utilised in their identification. however, only 14/42 gene-products were expressed as annotated. translation was confirmed for 14 open reading frames with no attributed function (ecogene y-entries), while n-terminal sequence allowed the start codon to be accurately annotated for the genes yigf, yccu, yqic, ynfd, and yeex. the methionine start codon was cleaved in 11 gene-products  (atpe, hns, rpoz, rpll, cspc, yccj, yggx, yjgf, hima, infa, rpsq) and a further five showed loss of a signal peptide (pspe, hdeb, hdea, ynfd, ykfe). internal (tig, atpa, tufa) and n-terminal fragmentation (cspd, rpsf, atcu) of much larger  proteins was also detected, which may have resulted from physiological or translational processes. m(r) and pi isoforms were detected respectively for ptsh and gatb, each being phosphoproteins, as well as rply which manifested differences with respect to predicted m(r) and pi. in addition, yjgf was shown to belong to a small gene family of unknown function with ancient conserved regions  across procaryotes and eucaryotes. ygin was revealed to have a paralogue and orthologues in bacillus subtilis, synechocystis sp., mycobacterium tuberculosis,  neisseria gonorrhoea, and rhodococcus erythropolis. orthologues are also reported for yihd, yccu and yeex. of the 14 y-genes, only ykfe possessed no detectable orthologues. these results highlight the need to complement genomic analysis with detailed proteomics in order to gain a better understanding of cellular molecular biology, while the confirmation of the open reading frame start codon using edman degradation protein microsequencing has yet to be superseded by recent advances in mass spectrometry.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

AB  == aims: to evaluate rapid organism identification on positive blood culture bactec  nr media (phial types 26, 27, 42 and 17), and to assess the usefulness of these procedures in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. methods: two hundred and sixty, first positive, blood culture bottles from individual patients were tested by rapid identification methods selected on the basis of gram film organism morphology. tube coagulase and latex agglutination were applied to presumptive staphylococci; latex agglutination antigen detection methods to suspected pneumococci, neisseria and haemophilus sp; and latex agglutination grouping tests for cultures thought to be non-pneumococcal streptococci. results: media type did not influence test performance (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). misapplication of  methods occurred on eight occasions and there were 14 false positive results, nine involving the latex reagents for group c streptococci and pneumococci. the positive predictive values for tube coagulase tests and latex reactions for h influenzae type b, and n meningitidis groups b and c were 100%. the pneumococcal  and staphylococcal latex tests gave positive predictive values of 94.1% and 62.5%, respectively, and the corresponding figure for streptococcal grouping reactions was 75.9%. with the exception of staphylococcal latex testing (80%) all investigation negative predictive values were > 90%. conclusions: the performance of the staphylococcal latex agglutination method was unsatisfactory and it is not appropriate for use with the media studied. in view of the cross-reactions observed with the tests used to identify group c streptococci and pneumococci, positive findings must be interpreted with caution. in all other regards the protocol evaluated produced rapid, reliable, clinically useful information and, subject to local experience, is recommended to users of bactec nr media.

AB  == unlike neisseria meningitidis groups a, c, y and w135, the group b capsular polysaccharide has been shown to be chemically and immunologically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of escherichia coli k1. both components are sialic acid homopolymers and are poorly immunogenic. nevertheless, due to the high incidence of neisseria meningitidis group b meningitis in the population of the state of sao paulo, preparing antiserum to this serogroup for diagnostic purposes has become a matter of high priority. of the many immunization schemes proposed,  intravenous inoculation of whole bacteria previously inactivated with formaldehyde and simultaneous intradermal inoculation with a mixture of the bacterial polysaccharide fraction and whole bacteria in complete freund;s adjuvant have produced the best results. the antiserum was treated with immunoadsorbents prepared with aluminum chloride and protein and/or polysaccharide antigens from each of the following heterologous bacteria: haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli other than k1, and staphylococcus aureus, in order to eliminate cross-reactivity. for quality control analysis, the antiserum was assessed by the immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, dot-elisa, and immuno-blot techniques against homologous antigens. specificity was obtained after treating the antiserum with haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide immunosorbent.

TI  == identification and characterization of the treponema pallidum tpn50 gene, an ompa homolog.
AB  == treponema pallidum is a pathogenic spirochete that has no known genetic exchange  mechanisms. in order to identify treponemal genes encoding surface and secreted proteins, we carried out tnphoa mutagenesis of a t. pallidum genomic dna library  in escherichia coli. several of the resulting clones expressed enzymatically active t. pallidum-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins. the dna sequence of the  5' portion of a number of the treponemal genes was obtained and analyzed. a recombinant clone harboring plasmid p4a2 that encoded a treponemal protein with an approximate molecular mass of 50,000 da was identified. plasmid p4a2 contained an open reading frame of 1,251 nucleotides that resulted in a predicted protein of 417 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47,582 da. we have named this gene tpn50 in accordance with the current nomenclature for t. pallidum genes. a 1.9-kb hincii-clai fragment from p4a2 that contained the tpn50 gene was  subcloned to produce p4a2hc2. comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of  tpn50 with protein sequences in the national center for biotechnology information data base indicated statistically significant homology to the pseudomonas sp. oprf, e. coli ompa, bordetella avium ompa, neisseria meningitidis rmpm, neisseria gonorrhoeae piii, haemophilus influenzae p6, e. coli pal, and legionella pneumophila pal proteins. these proteins are all members of a family of outer membrane proteins that are present in gram-negative bacteria. the tpn50 gene complemented e. coli ompa mutations on the basis of two separate criteria. first, morphometry and electron microscopy data showed that e. coli c386 (ompa lpp) cells harboring plasmid vector pebh21 were rounded while cells of the same strain harboring p4a2hc2 (tpn50+), pww2200 (oprf+), or prd87 (ompa+) were rod shaped. second, e. coli bre51 (mc4100 delta sula-ompa) cells harboring pebh21 grew poorly at 42 degrees c in minimal medium, while the growth of bre51 cells harboring p4a2hc2 was similar to that of the parental mc4100 cells. these results demonstrate that the tpn50 protein is functionally equivalent to the e. coli ompa protein. if tpn50 functions in a similar fashion in t. pallidum, then it may be localized to the treponemal outer membrane.

TI  == [antibiotherapy as first choice in infectious meningitis].
AB  == the choice of antibiotics in bacterial meningitis must integrate several parameters. i) the bacterial epidemiology of community acquired meningitis: haemophilus influenzae (hi) neisseria meningitidis (nm), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) represents more than 95% of cases; ii) the increase of antibiotic bacterial  resistance, particularly preoccupying for sp; iii) the microbiological properties and pharmacokinetics of antibiotics, especially their penetration in csf: the concentrations achieved must be several times higher than the mbc. in fact, csf is not favourable to the antibiotic activity; iv) the results of clinical comparative trials; v) the contribution of animal models to the knowledge of meningitis physiopathology. third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) satisfy this objective for hi, nm, and penicillin sensitive strains  of sp. for penicillin resistant sp, no treatment can achieve antibiotic csf concentrations higher than ten times the mbc. an increase in dosage of cephalosporins, the use of an other regimen (vancomycin or imipenem) and antibiotic association (rifamycin, fosfomycin) are needed.

AB  == the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (sc-47111; ny-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. the mics of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. ninety percent of neisseria sp. and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. there was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. the protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. however, urine at ph 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at ph 7.0

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [assessment of a commonly available latex particle agglutination test in rapid, bacteriologic cerebrospinal fluid diagnosis].
AB  == 36 cerebrospinal fluid specimens (csf) from patients with bacterial meningitis were tested for the presence of bacterial antigens with the "slidex meningite kit" (bio merieux). this kit has latex particles coated with antibodies against hemophilus influenzae type b (hib) streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) and neisseria meningitidis (nm) group a and c. with the lat we could detect the bacterial antigens in 84% of bacterial meningitis cases, 23 of the 27 of hib meningitis (85.2%), all of the 6 cases of sp meningitis (100%) and two of the three nm meningitis cases. the test is handicapped by the fact, that there is no antiserum against nm sero-group b, the main cause of nm meningitis in austria. there were no false positive results with the lat. false negative results were obtained in 19.2% of hib and in one case of nm. even under sufficient antibiotic therapy and  with negative culture we could detect 9 hib- and 1 nm-cases during the first 12-48 hours of therapy with this method. the lat-kit is a useful addition to standard methods of csf examinations in bacterial meningitis. with the lat a rapid bacteriological diagnosis is possible within 15 minutes. the kit is also able to identify bacterial antigens even with negative culture and after initiation of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == trospectomycin, a novel spectinomycin analogue: antibacterial activity and preliminary human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == trospectomycin (tsp; u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin (sp) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of the analogue was  compared to that of sp against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the in vivo  activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative bacteria. the preliminary human  pharmacokinetics of tsp were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. tsp was more active in vitro than sp (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus spp., bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis. the activity of tsp for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was comparable  to that of sp. tsp was more active than sp (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental  infections due to streptococci, salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. tsp was well-absorbed following both i.v.  and i.m. administration. pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; tmax = 25, 75 min; and auc = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive hplc assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). tsp inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nucleotide sequence comparisons of plasmids phd131, pjb1, pfa3, and pfa7 and beta-lactamase expression in escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == the sites of initiation for beta-lactamase mrna transcription and the nucleotide  sequences of beta-lactamase plasmids derived from haemophilus and neisseria species were determined. in n. gonorrhoeae, transcription from plasmid pfa3 was initiated from two sites, one located about 20 base pairs (bp) and the other 210  bp upstream of the beta-lactamase initiating codon, whereas in h. influenzae, transcriptional initiation from plasmid phd131 occurred at two different sites, approximately 150 and 170 bp upstream of the initiating codon. when these plasmids were transformed into escherichia coli, transcription was initiated at the 150- and 170-bp upstream sites in both plasmids. the nucleotide sequences of  both plasmids within the noncoding region upstream of the transcriptional initiation site were identical and, except at two or three nucleotide positions,  the sequences were also identical to the corresponding region of tn3. at one of these positions there is a ta for cg substitution, which correlates in e. coli and haemophilus sp. with the presence of two strong, overlapping beta-lactamase promoters, initiating transcription at the 150- and 170-bp upstream sites. over a larger (875-bp) segment comprising most of the sequences of the tnpr and bla genes, the nucleotide sequences of both plasmids were also identical, and although this sequence differed from the corresponding tn3 sequence at 18 sites,  it was identical to that of tn2, except at one site. the sequence of a second haemophilus plasmid, pjb1, was identical to that of phd131 in the same region, except at two nucleotides. all three plasmids were identical in nucleotide sequence in other tna regions, as well as in regions flanking the tna sequence, except that the neisseria plasmid lacked a tna segment of 3,298 bp [comprising the ir(l) and proximal sequences] together with approximately 273 bp of the non-tna region adjacent to ir(l). the sequence of a second n. gonorrhoeae plasmid, pfa7, was identical to pfa3, except that the terminal, 3,299 tna nucleotides were missing.

AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == disk diffusion susceptibility testing of two macrolide antimicrobial agents: revised interpretive criteria for erythromycin and preliminary guidelines for roxithromycin (ru 965).
AB  == the 15-micrograms erythromycin disk was twice evaluated for interpretive accuracy against 417 and then 266 strains of gram-positive cocci, neisseria meningitidis,  and haemophilus influenzae by using the criteria suggested by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. these studies suggest a revision of  streptococcal and staphylococcus sp. interpretive guidelines to criteria (greater than or equal to 23 mm = susceptible, less than or equal to 13 mm = resistant) that are more compatible with in vivo erythromycin concentrations. it is also recommended that zone diameters be modified for h. influenzae (greater than or equal to 23 mm = susceptible, less than 22 mm = resistant) and that meningococci  not be tested. a wide moderately susceptible category (1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml)  would primarily include enterococcus strains and those organisms that would then  respond only to parenteral administration of erythromycin. roxithromycin (ru 965  or ru 28965), a new oxime ether erythromycin derivative, was also evaluated by investigator-prepared 15-micrograms disks and later with 30- and 60-micrograms commercial disks. although roxithromycin was comparable to erythromycin in activity and regression line statistics, changes in the susceptible disk criteria were necessary because of superior roxithromycin serum concentrations and a longer serum half-life. preliminary susceptible breakpoint criteria were greater  than 21 mm = susceptible, 10 to 20 mm = indeterminate, and less than or equal to  9 mm = resistant. by using the recommended interpretive criteria for both macrolides, less than 98% absolute agreement was obtained, therefore suggesting the application of a spectrum class concept.

TI  == [prospective evaluation of coagglutination and latex agglutination in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in childhood].
AB  == two simple and low-priced kits to detect bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from patients with suspected meningitis have recently become available. methods employed by these kits are staphylococcal coagglutination (coa) and latex agglutination (la). the coa "phadebact csf-kit" (pharmacia) detects haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), neisseria meningitidis (nm) groups a, b, c, y and w 135 and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), whereas the la "slidex meningite-kit" (biomerieux) includes hib, nm a, nm c and sp. these two diagnostic tests were compared with the standard methods for analyzing csf specimens from children with suspected meningitis. a total of 336 csf specimens were tested. forty-three were from children with bacterial meningitis due to hib, nm or sp obtained before antimicrobial therapy. thirty-four of them (79%) were correctly detected by coa, 23 (54%) by la, and 42 (97%) by microscopic analysis of stained smears. there were 65 csf samples of such meningitis cases obtained after initiation of antimicrobial therapy: coa detected 26 (40%), la 17 (26%) and staining 26 (40%). with culture-positive csf specimens from patients before therapy, the best sensitivities were obtained with la for sp (100%) and coa for hib (87%), whereas the results for nm antigen detection were only 43% with coa and 0% with la (no reagent against nm b). cross-reactions with other bacterial antigens were frequent with coa (26%) and rare with la (2%), resulting in false-positive findings in 6 of the 66 positive tests with coa (9%) but in none of the 40 positive tests with la (0%). one of the 48 specimens from aseptic meningitis cases was false-positive for hib by coa, whereas all 172 normal specimens were negative with both methods. with 5 culture-negative csf specimens  from patients with unequivocal purulent meningitis coa detected bacterial antigen in 5 and la in 2. conclusions: the two kits evaluated cannot replace standard methods for analyzing csf specimens, in view of insufficient sensitivity (mainly  la) or frequent cross-reactions and false-positive values (coa). however, due to  their simplicity, rapidity, and possible identification of bacterial pathogens after initiation of antimicrobial therapy, these kits are recommended as an useful addition to standard methods.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.
