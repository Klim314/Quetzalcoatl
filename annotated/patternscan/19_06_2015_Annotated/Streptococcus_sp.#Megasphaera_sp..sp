TI  == altered bacterial profiles in saliva from adults with caries lesions: a case-cohort study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to learn whether presence of caries in an adult population was associated with a salivary bacterial profile different from that of individuals without untreated caries. stimulated saliva samples from 621 participants of the danish health examination survey were analyzed using the human oral microbe identification microarray technology. samples from 174 individuals with dental caries and 447 from a control cohort were compared using  frequency and levels of identified bacterial taxa/clusters as endpoints. differences at taxon/cluster level were analyzed using mann-whitney's test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles. a reduced bacterial  diversity was observed in samples from subjects with dental caries. five bacterial taxa (veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica, megasphaera micronuciformis, fusobacterium periodontium and achromobacter xylosoxidans) and one bacterial cluster (leptotrichia sp. clones c3mkm102 and gt018_ot417/462) were less frequently found in the caries group (adjusted p value <0.01) while two bacterial taxa (solobacterium moorei and streptococcus salivarius) and three bacterial clusters (streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sp. clone be024_ot057/411/721, streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sinensis_ot411/721/767, streptococcus salivarius and sp. clone fo042_ot067/755) were present at significantly higher levels (adjusted p value <0.01). the principal component analysis displayed a marked difference in the bacterial community profiles between groups. presence of manifest caries was associated with a reduced diversity and an altered salivary bacterial community profile. our data support recent theories that ecological stress-induced changes of commensal  microbial communities are involved in the shift from oral health to tooth decay.

TI  == analysis of the airway microbiota of healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by t-rflp and clone sequencing.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a progressive, inflammatory lung  disease that affects a large number of patients and has significant impact. one hallmark of the disease is the presence of bacteria in the lower airways. objective: the aim of this study was to analyze the detailed structure of microbial communities found in the lungs of healthy individuals and patients with copd. nine copd patients as compared and 9 healthy individuals underwent flexible bronchoscopy and bal was performed. bacterial nucleic acids were subjected to terminal restriction fragment (trf) length polymorphism and clone library analysis. overall, we identified 326 t-rflp band, 159 in patients and 167 in healthy controls. the results of the trf analysis correlated partly with the data obtained from clone sequencing. although the results of the sequencing showed high diversity, the genera prevotella, sphingomonas, pseudomonas, acinetobacter,  fusobacterium, megasphaera, veillonella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus constituted the major part of the core microbiome found in both groups. a trf band possibly representing pseudomonas sp. monoinfection was associated with a reduction of the microbial diversity. non-cultural methods reveal the complexity  of the pulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals and in patients with copd. alterations of the microbiome in pulmonary diseases are correlated with disease.

TI  == correlation between composition of the bacterial community and concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen during the transition period and ketosis in dairy cows.
AB  == the transition period is a severe challenge to dairy cows. glucose supply cannot  meet demand and body fat is mobilized, potentially leading to negative energy balance (neb), ketosis, or fatty liver. propionate produces glucose by gluconeogenesis, which depends heavily on the number and species of microbes. in  the present study, we analyzed the rumen microbiome composition of cows in the transition period, cows with ketosis, and nonperinatal cows by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) analysis of 16s rrna genes and quantitative pcr. trflp analysis indicated that the quantity of veillonellaceae organisms was reduced and that of streptococcaceae organisms was increased in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillaceae organisms increased after calving. quantitative pcr data suggested that the numbers of the main propionate-producing microbes, megasphaera elsdenii and selenomonas ruminantium, were decreased, while numbers of the main lactate-producing bacterium, streptococcus bovis, were increased in the rumen of  cows from the transition period and ketosis groups, with the number of lactobacillus sp. organisms increased after calving. volatile fatty acid (vfa) and glucose concentrations were decreased, but the lactic acid concentration was  increased, in rumen samples from the transition period and ketosis groups. our results indicate that the vfa concentration is significantly related to the numbers of selenomonas ruminantium and megasphaera elsdenii organisms in the rumen.

TI  == utilization of amino acids by bacteria from the pig small intestine.
AB  == this study determined the utilization of amino acids (aa) by bacteria from the lumen of the pig small intestine. digesta samples from different segments of the  small intestine were inoculated into media containing 10 mmol/l each of select aa (l-lysine, l-threonine, l-arginine, l-glutamate, l-histidine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-proline, l-methionine, l-phenylalanine or l-tryptophan) and incubated for 24 h. the previous 24-h culture served as an inoculum for a subsequent 24-h subculture during each of 30 subcultures. results of the in vitro cultivation experiment indicated that the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, arginine, threonine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine, valine or histidine were 50-90% in the duodenum, jejunum or ileum groups. after 30 subcultures, the 24-h disappearance rates for lysine, threonine, arginine or glutamate remained greater than 50%. the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that streptococcus sp., mitsuokella sp., and megasphaera elsdenii-like bacteria were predominant in subcultures for utilizing lysine, threonine, arginine and glutamate. in contrast, klebsiella sp. was not a major user of arginine or glutamate. furthermore, analysis of aa composition and the incorporation of aa into polypeptides indicated that protein synthesis was a major pathway for aa metabolism in all the bacteria studied. the current work identified the possible  predominant bacterial species responsible for aa metabolism in the pig small intestine. the findings provide a new framework for future studies to characterize the metabolic fate of aa in intestinal microbes and define their nutritional significance for both animals and humans.

TI  == effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on simulated development of ruminal lactic acidosis in vitro.
AB  == a continuous coculture of four ruminal bacteria, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, and lactobacillus sp. strain lb17,  was used to study the effects of the ionophores monensin and tetronasin on the changes in ruminal microbial ecology that occur during the onset of lactic acidosis. in control incubations, the system simulated the development of lactic  acidosis in vivo, with an initial overgrowth of s. bovis when an excess of glucose was added to the fermentor. lactobacillus sp. strain lb17 subsequently became dominant as ph fell and lactate concentration rose. both ionophores were able to prevent the accumulation of lactic acid and maintain a healthy non-lactate-producing bacterial population when added at the same time as an excess of glucose. tetronasin was more potent in this respect than monensin. when tetronasin was added to the culture 24 h after glucose, the proliferation of lactobacilli was reversed and a non-lactate-producing bacterial population developed, with an associated drop in lactate concentration in the fermentor. rises in culture ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations accompanied these changes. monensin was unable to suppress the growth of lactobacilli; therefore, in contrast to tetronasin, monensin added 24 h after the addition of glucose failed to reverse the acidosis. numbers of lactobacilli and lactate concentrations remained high, whereas ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were low.
