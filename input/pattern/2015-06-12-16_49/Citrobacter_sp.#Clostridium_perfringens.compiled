TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
