TI  == [gynophilus--a winning relay].
AB  == the vagina is a complex biocenosis where many micro-organisms coexist and colonize it. the dominant colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual is of the genus "lactobacillus". it is also called doderlein's bacillus and determines the  vaginal microbial balance through the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, bacteriocines and modify the competition of pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal epithelial cells. through these mechanisms the lactobacilli block the growth and development of other vaginal pathogenic microbial species and also inhibit the colonization of some other microorganisms  imported from outside. because of these potential therapeutic properties, the lactobacilli are used as effective medical agents for prophylaxys and therapy to  restore the physiological balance in the vaginal eco-system. according to our studies and gained clinical experience the etiological antibacterial treatment is not always sufficient to restore the normal vaginal flora. the complete recovery  of the vaginal flora could be reached using probiotics that are applied locally and per os. gynophilus is a new vaginal probiotic product containing one type of  the genus "lactobacillus": lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus. gynophilus restores the physiological balance of the vaginal flora and reduces the risk of recurrent  infection. the product is applied intravaginal and interacts locally, inhibits the growth of the most common vaginal pathogens: gardnerella vaginalis u candida  albicans.

TI  == in vitro adherence of lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus isolated from three  commercial yogurts were compared to l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. cellobiosus, and l. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from american type culture collection cultures. l. acidophilus isolated from lactinex tablets was also tested. no significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the american type culture collection cultures, and the lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
