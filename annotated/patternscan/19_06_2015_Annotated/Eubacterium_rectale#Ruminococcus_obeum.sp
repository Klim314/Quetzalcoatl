TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == quantification of uncultured ruminococcus obeum-like bacteria in human fecal samples by fluorescent in situ hybridization and flow cytometry using 16s rrna-targeted probes.
AB  == a 16s rrna-targeted probe was designed and validated in order to quantify the number of uncultured ruminococcus obeum-like bacteria by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). these bacteria have frequently been found in 16s ribosomal  dna clone libraries prepared from bacterial communities in the human intestine. thirty-two reference strains from the human intestine, including a phylogenetically related strain and strains of some other ruminococcus species, were used as negative controls and did not hybridize with the new probe. microscopic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that a group of morphologically similar bacteria in feces did hybridize with this probe. moreover, it was found that all hybridizing cells also hybridized with a probe specific for the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group, a group that includes the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria. quantification of the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria and the c. coccoides-e. rectale group by flow cytometry and microscopy revealed that these groups comprised approximately 2.5 and 16% of the total community in fecal samples, respectively. the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria comprise about 16% of the c. coccoides-e. rectale group. these results indicate that the uncultured r. obeum-like bacteria are numerically important in human feces. statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the microscopic and flow cytometric counts and the different feces sampling times, while a significant host-specific effect on the counts was observed. our data demonstrate that the combination of fish and flow cytometry is a useful approach  for studying the ecology of uncultured bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract.
