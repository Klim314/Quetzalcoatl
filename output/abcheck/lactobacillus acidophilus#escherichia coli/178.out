[evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures added to commercial yogurt over a known population of listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7].
the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 during yogurt storage was evaluated.
two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (lactobacillus casei and l. acidophilus) were inoculated with known populations (106 ufc/g) of either l. monocytogenes or e. coli o157:h7 in three different times and stored for 32 days at 5 degrees c. every four days the count of lactic bacteria, the added pathogens and ph was evaluated, according to the methodology described in the bacteriological analytical manual.
the ph and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period.
yogurt with additional probiotic cultures reduced the population of l. monocytogenes in 8 days, the population of e. coli o157:h7 in 16; yogurt with no additional probiotics took 20 days to reduce l. monocytogenes to non-detectable levels and even after 28 days of storage, e. coli o157:h7 was cultured. in this work, the beneficial effects of additional probiotic cultures in yogurt is confirmed again.
