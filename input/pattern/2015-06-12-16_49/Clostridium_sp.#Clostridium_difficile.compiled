TI  - Engineered Biosynthesis of Enduracidin Lipoglycopeptide Antibiotics using the Ramoplanin Mannosyltransferase Ram29.
AB  - The lipopeptides ramoplanin from Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 33076 and enduracidin produced by Streptomyces fungicidicus are effective antibiotics against a number of drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. While these two antibiotics share a similar cyclic peptide structure, comprising 17 amino acids with an N-terminal fatty acid side chain, ramoplanin has a di-mannose moiety that enduracidin lacks. The mannosyl substituents of ramoplanin enhance aqueous solubility, which was important in the development of ramoplanin as a potential treatment for Clostridium difficile infections. In this study we have determined the function of the putative mannosyl transferase encoded by ram29 from the ramoplanin biosynthetic gene cluster. Bioinformatics revealed that Ram29 is an integral membrane protein with a putative DxD motif that is suggested to bind to, and activate, a polyprenyl phosphomannose donor and an extracytoplasmic C-terminal domain that is predicted to bind the ramoplanin aglycone acceptor. The ram29 gene was cloned into the tetracycline inducible plasmid pMS17 and integrated into the genome of the enduracidin producer S. fungicidicus. Induction of ram29 expression in S. fungicidicus resulted in the production of monomannosylated enduracidin derivatives, which are not present in the wild-type strain. Tandem MS analysis showed that mannosylation occurs on the Hpg11 residue of enduracidin. In addition to confirming the function of Ram29, these findings demonstrate how the less common, membrane associated, polyprenyl phosphosugar-dependent glycosyltransferases can be used in natural product glycodiversification. Such a strategy may be valuable in future biosynthetic engineering approaches aimed at improving the physicochemical and biological properties of bioactive secondary metabolites including antibiotics.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Alert microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in Malopolskie province  in 2010-2012.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare centers undertake supervisory activities to control health  care-associated infections (HCAIs) by elaborating procedures, identifying alert microorganisms and analyzing data collected. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of alert microorganisms in hospital wards in 2010-2012. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Legislation which is in force since several years introduced the principles of health care-associated infections control and reporting system. Analysis was based on annual reports on alert microorganisms provided by 19 District Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations from Malopolskie province. The data discuss positive tests results for alert microorganisms in patients who stayed in hospitals supervised by the Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations. RESULTS: Compared to 2010-2011, the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012 was lower, amounting to 24 (2010 - 44, 2011 - 34). Of these tests, the majority was performed in the following wards: transplantology (2010 - 339, 2011 - 354, 2012 - 330), burn care (2010 - 354, 2011 - 148, 2012 - 113) and ICUs for adults (2010 - 155, 2011 - 157, 2012 - 140). In 2010-2012, an increase in the number of positive test results for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL+) and Clostridium difficile as well as slight decrease in the number of positive test results for other alert microorganisms were noted. The highest number of microorganisms was identified in neonatal and neonatal pathology (Enterobacteriaceae ESBL+); pediatric and infectious diseases (Rotavirus); infectious diseases (Rotavirus, C.difficile); burn care (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas sp.) and ophthalmic and hemodialysis wards (MRSA). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of a decrease in the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012, a high number of positive test results for alert microorganisms was observed. It suggests the necessity for wider application of collected data as to improve monitoring of infections and reduce resulting threats.
TI  - Identification of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance genes from within an  infant gut functional metagenomic library.
AB  - The infant gut microbiota develops rapidly during the first 2 years of life, acquiring microorganisms from diverse sources. During this time, significant opportunities exist for the infant to acquire antibiotic resistant bacteria, which can become established and constitute the infant gut resistome. With increased antibiotic resistance limiting our ability to treat bacterial infections, investigations into resistance reservoirs are highly pertinent. This study aimed to explore the nascent resistome in antibiotically-naive infant gut microbiomes, using a combination of metagenomic approaches. Faecal samples from 22 six-month-old infants without previous antibiotic exposure were used to construct a pooled metagenomic library, which was functionally screened for ampicillin and gentamicin resistance. Our library of approximately 220Mb contained 0.45 ampicillin resistant hits/Mb and 0.059 gentamicin resistant hits/Mb. PCR-based analysis of fosmid clones and uncloned metagenomic DNA, revealed a diverse and abundant aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir within the infant gut, with resistance determinants exhibiting homology to those found in common gut inhabitants, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., and Clostridium difficile, as well as to genes from cryptic environmental bacteria. Notably, the genes identified differed from those revealed when a sequence-driven PCR-based screen of metagenomic DNA was employed. Carriage of these antibiotic resistance determinants conferred substantial, but varied (2-512x), increases in antibiotic resistance to their bacterial host. These data provide insights into the infant gut resistome, revealing the presence of a varied aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir even in the absence of selective pressure, confirming the infant resistome establishes early in life, perhaps even at birth.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of two commercial multiplex panels for detection of gastrointestinal pathogens by use of clinical stool specimens.
AB  - The detection of pathogens associated with gastrointestinal disease may be important in certain patient populations, such as immunocompromised hosts, the critically ill, or individuals with prolonged disease that is refractory to treatment. In this study, we evaluated two commercially available multiplex panels (the FilmArray gastrointestinal [GI] panel [BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT] and the Luminex xTag gastrointestinal pathogen panel [GPP] [Luminex Corporation, Toronto, Canada]) using Cary-Blair stool samples (n = 500) submitted to our laboratory for routine GI testing (e.g., culture, antigen testing, microscopy, and individual real-time PCR). At the time of this study, the prototype (non-FDA-cleared) FilmArray GI panel targeted 23 pathogens (14 bacterial, 5 viral, and 4 parasitic), and testing of 200 mul of Cary-Blair stool was recommended. In contrast, the Luminex GPP assay was FDA cleared for the detection of 11 pathogens (7 bacterial, 2 viral, and 2 parasitic), but had the capacity to identify 4 additional pathogens using a research-use-only protocol. Importantly, the Luminex assay was FDA cleared for 100 mul raw stool; however, 100 mul Cary-Blair stool was tested by the Luminex assay in this study. Among 230 prospectively collected samples, routine testing was positive for one or more GI pathogens in 19 (8.3%) samples, compared to 76 (33.0%) by the FilmArray and 69 (30.3%) by the Luminex assay. Clostridium difficile (12.6 to 13.9% prevalence) and norovirus genogroup I (GI)/GII (5.7 to 13.9% prevalence) were two of the pathogens most commonly detected by both assays among prospective samples. Sapovirus was also commonly detected (5.7% positive rate) by the FilmArray assay. Among 270 additional previously characterized samples, both multiplex panels demonstrated high sensitivity (>90%) for the majority of targets, with the exception of several pathogens, notably Aeromonas sp. (23.8%) by FilmArray and Yersinia enterocolitica (48.1%) by the Luminex assay. Interestingly, the FilmArray and Luminex panels identified mixed infections in 21.1% and 13.0% of positive prospective samples, respectively, compared to only 8.3% by routine methods.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea by Clostridium difficile in hematologic patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients: risk factors for severe forms and death.
AB  - We describe the rate of incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in hematologic and patients undergone stem cell transplant (HSCT) at HC-FMUSP, from January 2007 to June 2011, using two denominators 1,000 patient and 1,000 days of neutropenia and the risk factors associated with the severe form of the disease and death. The ELISA method (Ridascreen-Biopharm, Germany) for the detections of toxins A/B was used to identify C. difficile. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate potential factors associated with severe CDAD and death within 14 days after the diagnosis of CDAD, using multiple logistic regression. Sixty-six episodes were identified in 64 patients among 439 patients with diarrhea during the study period. CDA rate of incidence varied from 0.78 to 5.45 per 1,000 days of neutropenia and from 0.65 to 5.45 per 1,000 patient-days. The most common underlying disease was acute myeloid leukemia 30/64 (44%), 32/64 (46%) patients were neutropenic, 31/64 (45%) undergone allogeneic HSCT, 61/64 (88%) had previously used antibiotics and 9/64 (13%) have severe CDAD. Most of the patients (89%) received treatment with oral metronidazole and 19/64 (26%) died. The independent risk factors associated with death were the severe form of CDAD, and use of linezolid.
TI  - 5-Aminosalicylic Acid Inhibits Acute Clostridium difficile Toxin A-Induced Colitis in Rats.
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) inhibits toxin A-induced generation of colonic leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and toxin A colitis in rats. Isolated colonic segments in anesthetized rats were treated intraluminally with toxin A for 3 hours with or without 30 minutes of pretreatment with either 5-ASA or sulfapyridine and then colonic tissue levels of LTB4 were measured and inflammation was assessed. Separately, sulfasalazine was administered to rats in their drinking water for 5 days, isolated colonic segments were then prepared, toxin A was administered, and inflammation was assessed as before. Pretreatment with 5-ASA inhibited toxin A-induced increased tissue LTB4 concentration in the colon. Sulfasalazine and 5-ASA but not sulfapyridine significantly inhibited toxin A colitis. However, pretreatment with 5-ASA did not protect against direct TRPV1-mediated colitis caused by capsaicin. Toxin A stimulated the release of substance P (SP), and this effect was also inhibited by sulfasalazine and 5-ASA but not by sulfapyridine. Thus, toxin A stimulates colonic LTB4 resulting in activation of TRPV1, release of SP, and colitis. Inhibition of 5-LO by 5-ASA disrupts this pathway and supports the concept that LTB4 activation of TRPV1 plays a role in toxin A colitis.
TI  - Genes Encoding Toxin of Clostridium difficile in Children with and without Diarrhea.
AB  - The presence of gene 16S rRNA and genes encoding toxin A (tcdA), toxin B (tcdB),  and binary toxin (cdtA/cdtB) of Clostridium difficile in stool samples from children with (110) and without (150) diarrhea was determined by using a TaqMan system. Fifty-seven (21.9%) out of 260 stool samples harbored the 16S rRNA gene. The genetic profile of tcdA+/tcdB- and cdtA+/cdtB+ was verified in one C. difficile-positive diarrhea sample and of tcdA+/tcdB+ in three C. difficile-positive nondiarrhea samples. The presence of tcdA+/tcdB+ in stools obtained from children without diarrhea, suggests that they were asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic strains.
TI  - An analysis of risk factors of Clostridiumdifficile infection in patients hospitalized in the teaching hospital in 2008.
AB  - The last decade saw an increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infections.Approximately 80% of these infections occur in hospitalized patients. There are ongoing studies on the increase in the incidence of infections with this microorganism. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the risk factors of C. dicfficile infections in patients hospitalized in the teaching hospital in Warsaw in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to achieve this objective. The study group comprised 266 patients. Patients in the study group were assessed for the following factors: sex; age; place of residence; hospitalizations; the use of proton pump inhibitors (IPP), various antibiotics, probiotics; hospital stay conditions, and the patient's condition. RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed that out of the assessed risk factors, hospitalization within the 3 months preceding hospital admission (OR 5.02; P<0.003) and antibiotic therapy (OR 4.85; P<0.003) were associated with the highest risk of C. difficile infection. Hospital stay conditions, including a stay in a multi-bed room (OR 1.64; P=0.05) or in a room without an en suite toilet (OR 1.59; P=0.01), were also shown to play a role. The risk of a C. difficile infection was also increased in the case of "bed-ridden" patients requiring the assistance of hospital staff for their daily hygiene (OR 1.69; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hospitalization itself, including the frequency and conditions of hospital stay, as well as receiving antibiotic therapy were significant risk factors of C. difficile infections in patients hospitalized at the SP CSK. Therefore, our analysis showed that C. difficile infections are mostly nosocomial.
TI  - [The use of molecular methods in the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infections].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to use molecular methods to identify selected strains of C. difficile isolated from patients hospitalized at Independent Public Central Teaching Hospital [SP CSK] between 2008 and 2011 in order to demonstrate their toxicgenic character and to determine their epidemic potential, including the incidence of a suspected C. difficile strain 027/NAP1/B1. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Originally evaluated material consisted of freshly collected stool samples from patients who had developed diarrhea. Stool samples were assessed for toxins A and B via an immunoenzymatic method and for the presence of C. difficile via the first culture method. The isolated strains were stored on MICROBANK mediums, at -70 degrees C. From this sample collection, 48 strains isolated in 2008 and 28 strains isolated in 2011 were selected for molecular analysis. RESULTS: Among the C. difficile isolates that underwent molecular analysis there were 6 strains 027/NAP1/BI out of the 48 evaluated strains isolated in 2008, which constituted 12.5% and 24 strains 027/NAP1/BI out of the 28 strains isolated in 2011, which constituted 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of a possible hyperepidemic strain of C. difficile is crucial for undertaking any anti-epidemic activities in health care facilities, where such activities are more and more common and are responsible for nosocomial foci of infection.
TI  - Added value of multiplex Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG(R) GPP) testing in the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  - The Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG((R)) GPP) detects in one assay  the most common gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and toxins, namely adenovirus 40/41, norovirus genogroup (NG) I/II, rotavirus A, Clostridium difficile toxin A/B, Campylobacter sp., Escherichia coli O157, Enterotoxigenic E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin/heat-stable enterotoxin, Salmonella sp., Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Shiga-like toxin (Stx)1/2, Shigella sp., Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia sp. In this study, we compared the results that were obtained by testing 393 faecal samples, collected during November and December 2011 at our laboratory, using the xTAG((R)) GPP assay with the results of the routine diagnostic procedure. This procedure includes culture for bacteria and real-time PCR for viruses and parasites, but only if the test was requested by the clinician. If the clinician did not request the test for an xTAG((R)) GPP-positive target, real-time PCR assays were used to confirm xTAG((R)) GPP positivity. Discrepant results were also tested with real-time PCR assays. A total of 83 targets were detected in 76 samples using xTAG((R)) GPP. The xTAG((R)) GPP assay detected 43 additional positives compared with the routine diagnostic procedure, of which 11 targets could not be confirmed by real-time PCR. The non-confirmed targets were Campylobacter (one sample), Salmonella (four samples), Shigella (one sample) and E. histolytica (five samples). The xTAG((R)) GPP was shown to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of 15 major gastrointestinal pathogens in a single molecular test, but for detection of E. histolytica and Salmonella, a confirmatory assay is indicated.
TI  - Successful treatment of simulated Clostridium difficile infection in a human gut  model by fidaxomicin first line and after vancomycin or metronidazole failure.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fidaxomicin reduces the risk of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) compared with vancomycin. We investigated fidaxomicin primary or secondary treatment efficacy using a gut model. METHODS: Four triple-stage chemostat gut models were inoculated with faeces. After clindamycin induction of CDI, fidaxomicin (200 mg/L twice daily), vancomycin (125 mg/L four times daily) or metronidazole (9.3 mg/L three times daily) was administered for 7 days. Following failure/CDI recurrence, fidaxomicin (200 mg/L twice daily, 7 days) was instilled. C. difficile (CD) total viable counts (TVC), spore counts (SP), toxin titres (CYT), gut bacteria counts and antimicrobial concentrations were measured throughout. RESULTS: Fidaxomicin instillation reduced CD TVC/SP and CYT below the limit of detection (LOD) after 2 and 4 days, respectively, with no CDI recurrence. Metronidazole instillation failed to decrease CD TVC or CYT. Vancomycin instillation reduced CD TVC and CYT to LOD by day 4, but SP persisted. Recurrence occurred 13 days after vancomycin instillation; subsequent fidaxomicin instillation reduced CD TVC/SP/CYT below the LOD from day 2. CD was isolated sporadically, with no evidence of spore recrudescence or toxin production. Fidaxomicin had a minimal effect on the microflora, except for bifidobacteria. Fidaxomicin was detected for at least 21 days post-instillation, whereas other antimicrobials were undetectable beyond approximately 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: Fidaxomicin successfully treated simulated primary and recurrent CDI. Fidaxomicin was superior to metronidazole in reducing CD TVC and SP, and superior to vancomycin in reducing SP without recurrence of vegetative cell growth. Fidaxomicin, but not vancomycin or metronidazole, persisted in the gut model for >20 days after instillation.
TI  - Characterisation of the spoilage bacterial microbiota in oyster gills during storage at different temperatures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spoilage bacterial community in oyster gill was investigated during storage at 4, 10 and 20 degrees C. Aerobic plate counts and pH values were determined. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from oyster gill and bulk cells of plate count media. The major bacterial species during fresh or different temperatures storage were determined by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). RESULTS: The initial aerobic plate count in oyster gill reached 6.70 log CFU g(-1). PCR-DGGE fingerprinting analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region revealed that most of the strains in fresh oyster gill belonged to the genera Lactococcus and Enterobacter. The major spoilage bacteria at a storage temperature of 20 degrees C were Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, an uncultured bacterium, Cytophaga fermentans, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudoalteromonas sp., Enterococcus mundtii, Clostridium difficile and an uncultured Fusobacteria; those at 10 degrees C were Lactococcus spp., Lactobacillus curvatus, Weissella confusa and C. difficile; those at 4 degrees C were Lactococcus, Weissella, Enterobacter and Aeromonas. The other minor species were L. curvatus, Pseudomonas sp. and E. mundtii. Lactococcus spp. was the most common main spoilage bacteria in oyster gill during chilled storage. CONCLUSION: PCR-DGGE revealed the complexity of the bacterial microbiota and the major bacteria species in oyster gill for fresh and storage.
TI  - Changes of poultry faecal microbiota associated with Clostridium difficile colonisation.
AB  - Bacterial, fungal and archaeal microbiota was analysed in 143 chicken faecal samples from a single poultry farm. After DHPLC (denaturing high performance liquid chromatography) 15 bacterial groups, 10 fungal groups and a single archaeal species were differentiated. Samples were grouped into two clusters with significantly different frequencies of C. difficile positive and negative samples in each cluster. Acidaminococcus intestini, described here for the first time as a part of poultry faecal microbiota, was significantly more likely present in C. difficile negative samples, while presence/absence of some other microorganisms (Enterococcus cecorum, Lactobacillus galinarum, Moniliella sp. and Trichosporon asahii) was close to significance. Two other groups not reported previously for poultry, Coprobacillus sp. and Turicibacter sp. did not differ significantly between C. difficile positive and negative samples. Differences in microbiota diversity depend on animal age, but not on the presence of C. difficile. With machine learning (WEKA J48) we have defined specific combinations of microbial groups predictive for C. difficile colonisation. Microbial groups associated with C. difficile colonisation in poultry are different than those reported for humans and include bacteria as well as fungi. Also with this approach A. intestini was found to be most strongly related to C. difficile negative samples.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infection in horses: a review.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea  and enterocolitis in horses. Foals and adult horses are equally susceptible to the infection. The highly resistant spore of C. difficile is the infectious unit of transmission, which occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route, with sources of infection including equine feces, contaminated soil, animal hospitals, and feces of other animals. Two major risk factors for the development of C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) in adult horses are hospitalization and antimicrobial treatment, although sporadically, cases of CDAD can occur in horses that have not received antimicrobials or been hospitalized. The most common antibiotics associated with CDAD in horses are erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfonamides, beta-lactam antimicrobials, clindamycin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. Clinical signs and intestinal lesions of CDAD infection are not specific and they cannot be used to distinguish infections by C. difficile from infections by other agents, such as Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella sp. The distribution of lesions throughout the intestinal tract seems to be age-dependent. Small intestine is invariably affected, and colon and cecum may or may not have lesions in foals<1-month old. Naturally acquired disease in older foals and adult horses has a more aboral distribution, affecting colon and sometimes cecum, but rarely the small intestine. Detection of toxin A, toxin B or both in intestinal contents or feces is considered the most reliable diagnostic criterion for CDAD in horses. Isolation of toxigenic strains of C. difficile from horses with intestinal disease is highly suggestive of CDAD. A better understanding of pathogenesis, reservoirs of infection, and vaccines and other methods of control is needed. Also further studies are recommended to investigate other possible predisposing factors and/or etiological agents of enteric diseases of horses.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the CspB protease required for Clostridium  spore germination.
AB  - Spores are the major transmissive form of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridium difficile, a leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea worldwide. Successful transmission of C. difficile requires that its hardy, resistant spores germinate into vegetative cells in the gastrointestinal tract. A critical step during this process is the degradation of the spore cortex, a thick layer of peptidoglycan surrounding the spore core. In Clostridium sp., cortex degradation depends on the proteolytic activation of the cortex hydrolase, SleC. Previous studies have implicated Csps as being necessary for SleC cleavage during germination; however, their mechanism of action has remained poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that CspB is a subtilisin-like serine protease whose activity is essential for efficient SleC cleavage and C. difficile spore germination. By solving the first crystal structure of a Csp family member, CspB, to 1.6 A, we identify key structural domains within CspB. In contrast with all previously solved structures of prokaryotic subtilases, the CspB prodomain remains tightly bound to the wildtype subtilase domain and sterically occludes a catalytically competent active site. The structure, combined with biochemical and genetic analyses, reveals that Csp proteases contain a unique jellyroll domain insertion critical for stabilizing the protease in vitro and in C. difficile. Collectively, our study provides the first molecular insight into CspB activity and function. These studies may inform the development of inhibitors that can prevent clostridial spore germination and thus disease transmission.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (UC), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of UC. METHODS: The fecal microbiota of 30 UC samples obtained from 15 patients who were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. RESULTS: The fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with UC and the control subjects (P = 0.0004). UC-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with UC. Significant reduction of bacterial diversity of members of the Clostridium cluster IV and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including Ruminococcus bromii et rel. Eubacterium rectale et rel., Roseburia sp., and Akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in UC. Increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including Fusobacterium sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., Helicobacter sp., and Campylobacter sp. as well as Clostridium difficile were found to be associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Dysbiosis in UC is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. The microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.
TI  - SpoIVA and SipL are Clostridium difficile spore morphogenetic proteins.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen whose infections are difficult to treat because of their frequent recurrence. The spores of C. difficile are responsible for these clinical features, as they resist common disinfectants and antibiotic treatment. Although spores are the major transmissive form of C. difficile, little is known about their composition or morphogenesis. Spore morphogenesis has been well characterized for Bacillus sp., but Bacillus sp. spore coat proteins are poorly conserved in Clostridium sp. Of the known spore morphogenetic proteins in Bacillus subtilis, SpoIVA is one of the mostly highly conserved in the Bacilli and the Clostridia. Using genetic analyses, we demonstrate that SpoIVA is required for proper spore morphogenesis in C. difficile. In particular, a spoIVA mutant exhibits defects in spore coat localization but not cortex formation. Our study also identifies SipL, a previously uncharacterized protein found in proteomic studies of C. difficile spores, as another critical spore morphogenetic protein, since a sipL mutant phenocopies a spoIVA mutant. Biochemical analyses and mutational analyses indicate that SpoIVA and SipL directly interact. This interaction depends on the Walker A ATP binding motif of SpoIVA and the LysM domain of SipL. Collectively, these results provide the first insights into spore morphogenesis in C. difficile.
TI  - Comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term Indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): Acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  - In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were Acinetobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp. However, CB infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of Acinetobacter sp. consisting of Acinetobacter pittii (former Acinetobacter genomic species 3), Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter baumannii in the VB infants clone library. Among these, Acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and Acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.
TI  - [Assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile. This study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) and C. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. METHODS: The strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical Uniwersity of Warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the API20 ANA (bioMerieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) system. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using E-test. RESULTS: The rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of BFG was respectively 84% and 31% and among of C. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). The percentage of BFG strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. The percentage of C. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. Reduced level of susceptibility of BFG strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. Resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of BFG strains. All tested strains as well as BFG and C. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. Was observed reduced leve (EUCAST) of susceptibility of C. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). CONCLUSIONS. Increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in Poland. This demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Recent changes in Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the main cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Diarrhea associated with C. difficile has increased incidence, morbidity, and mortality in the last few years. The major related risk factors include use of antibiotics, elderly patients and prolonged hospital stay. Many patients receive combinations of antibiotics or multiple antibiotics, which represents the main risk to develop diarrhea associated to C. difficile or its recurrence. Therefore, interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing, as well as compliance with infection control measures can reduce hospital-acquired C. difficile infections. This review addresses the epidemiological changes in C. difficile disease and its treatment.
TI  - Clostridia in premature neonates' gut: incidence, antibiotic susceptibility, and  perinatal determinants influencing colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although premature neonates (PN) gut microbiota has been studied, data about gut clostridial colonization in PN are scarce. Few studies have reported clostridia colonization in PN whereas Bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. Such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. Besides, PN are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. The aim of this study was to report the distribution of Clostridium species isolated in feces from PN and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 76 PN followed until hospital discharge in three French neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 79% were colonized by clostridia. Clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. Antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except C. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. However, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10 days) antibiotic courses (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). Besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the NICU (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: This study shows that clostridia are part of the PN gut microbiota. It provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in PN showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules. Thus, the high prevalence of this genus is not linked to a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents or to the use of antibiotics in NICUs. The main perinatal determinant influencing PN clostridia colonization appears to be the NICU environment.
TI  - Nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms in the pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - Nosocomial infections in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms are increasing. This review attempts to report on significant findings in the current literature related to nosocomial infections in PICU settings with an international perspective. The types of nosocomial infections are addressed, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and post-surgical wound infections. A review of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Basic and enhanced infection control methods for the management and control of multidrug-resistant organisms are also summarized with an emphasis on prevention.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Bacteriophage treatment significantly reduces viable Clostridium difficile and prevents toxin production in an in vitro model system.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, causing thousands of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the UK each year. In this study, we used a batch fermentation model of a C. difficile colonised system to evaluate the potential of a prophylactic and a remedial bacteriophage treatment regime to control the pathogen. It is shown that the prophylaxis regime was effective at preventing the growth of C. difficile (p = <0.001) and precluded the production of detectable levels of toxins A and B. The remedial treatment regime caused a less profound and somewhat transient decrease in the number of viable C. difficile cells (p = <0.0001), but still resulted in a lower level of toxin production relative to the control. The numbers of commensal bacteria including total aerobes and anaerobes, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp., total Clostridium sp., and Enterobacteriaceae were not significantly decreased by this therapy, whereas significant detrimental effects were observed with metronidazole treatment. Our study indicates that phage therapy has potential to be used for the control of C. difficile; it highlights the main benefits of this approach, and some future challenges.
TI  - Pseudo-outbreak of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) in a tertiary-care hospital.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe a pseudo-outbreak of C. difficile in  a hospital, following a change in the method used to detect the toxin. In February 2002, there were two cases of CDAD and in March 7 occurred, coinciding with a change of the test (from detection of toxin A to toxin A/B). An outbreak was suspected. Active surveillance and education of staff were started. A CDAD case was defined as a patient with acute onset of diarrhea (> or = three episodes of liquid stools) and a positive stool test. They were classified as hospital or community-acquired. Stool samples were also collected for C. difficile culture and isolates were typed using AP-PCR. From March 2002 through December 2003 there were 138 cases of CDAD: 70% were hospital-acquired and among the 30% with CDAD present on admission, most (81%) came directly from the community (50% had no history of hospitalization). Fifty-two percent of hospital-acquired CDAD and 94% of cases on admission had already used antibiotics. The incidence of CDAD in hospitalized patients during surveillance was 3.3 per 1000 patient-admissions. The incidence of CDAD present on admission was 6.1/1000 patients. Sixteen isolates were typed and presented 13 different profiles. In conclusion, the CDAD increase in our study occurred due to change in diagnostic methods and not due to an outbreak, as suspected initially. The incidence in hospitalized patients was much lower than in reported outbreaks. There were 13 molecular types suggesting that an outbreak did not occur. CDAD was largely community-acquired.
TI  - GTPases RhoA and Rac1 are important for amelogenin and DSPP expression during differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts.
AB  - Morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation are distinct processes in tooth development. Cell proliferation predominates in morphogenesis; differentiation involves changes in form and gene expression. The cytoskeleton is essential for both processes, being regulated by Rho GTPases. The aim of this study was to verify the expression, distribution, and role of Rho GTPases in ameloblasts and odontoblasts during tooth development in correlation with actin and tubulin arrangements and amelogenin and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) expression. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were strongly expressed during morphogenesis; during cytodifferentiation, RhoA was present in ameloblasts and odontoblasts, Rac1 and its effector Pak3 were observed in ameloblasts; and Cdc42 was present in all cells of the tooth germ and mesenchyme. The expression of RhoA mRNA and its effectors RockI and RockII, Rac1 and Pak3, as analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, increased after ameloblast and odontoblast differentiation, according to the mRNA expression of amelogenin and DSPP. The inhibition of all Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin A completely abolished amelogenin and DSPP expression in tooth germs cultured in anterior eye chamber, whereas the specific inhibition of the Rocks showed only a partial effect. Thus, both GTPases are important during tooth morphogenesis. During cytodifferentiation, Rho proteins are essential for the complete differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts by regulating the expression of amelogenin and DSPP. RhoA and its effector RockI contribute to this role. A specific function for Rac1 in ameloblasts remains to be elucidated; its punctate distribution indicates its possible role in exocytosis/endocytosis.
TI  - Quantitative real time PCR detection of Clostridium difficile growth inhibition by probiotic organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic microorganisms are potential treatments for Clostridium difficile diarrheal disease (CDD) but better methods are needed to determine the relative potency of probiotic microorganisms against pathogenic organisms in mixed cultures. AIM: Quantify C. difficile in the presence of putative probiotic organisms using molecular methods to determine relative probiotic potency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C. difficile strains were cultivated anaerobically. Serial dilutions of Lactobacillus cultures or microbial mixtures from kefir were co-cultured with C. difficile for 48 hours. Bacterial DNA was extracted and qPCR was used to measure C. difficile toxin A gene, on the basis of cycle threshold (Ct) number. RESULTS: Strains of Lactobacillus (human and ATCC derived), and mixed cultures from commercial kefir were co-cultured with C. difficile. Lactobacillus and the microbial mixture from kefir were ranked in order of their potency in C. difficile growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: PCR allows facile quantification of C. difficle in the presence of other. The technique measures relative potency of over-the-counter probiotics and may predict human strains meriting probiotic status.
TI  - PKA and Epac cooperate to augment bradykinin-induced interleukin-8 release from human airway smooth muscle cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway smooth muscle contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases by secreting inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 production is in part regulated via activation of Gq-and Gs-coupled receptors. Here we study the role of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) effectors protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2) in the bradykinin-induced IL-8 release from a human airway smooth muscle cell line and the underlying molecular mechanisms of this response. METHODS: IL-8 release was assessed via ELISA under basal condition and after stimulation with bradykinin alone or in combination with fenoterol, the Epac activators 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP and Sp-8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMPS, the PKA activator 6-Bnz-cAMP and the cGMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cGMP. Where indicated, cells were pre-incubated with the pharmacological inhibitors Clostridium difficile toxin B-1470 (GTPases), U0126 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2) and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (PKA). The specificity of the cyclic nucleotide analogs was confirmed by measuring phosphorylation of the PKA substrate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. GTP-loading of Rap1 and Rap2 was evaluated via pull-down technique. Expression of Rap1, Rap2, Epac1 and Epac2 was assessed via western blot. Downregulation of Epac protein expression was achieved by siRNA. Unpaired or paired two-tailed Student's t test was used. RESULTS: The beta2-agonist fenoterol augmented release of IL-8 by bradykinin. The PKA activator 6-Bnz-cAMP and the Epac activator 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP significantly increased bradykinin-induced IL-8 release. The hydrolysis-resistant Epac activator Sp-8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMPS mimicked the effects of 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, whereas the negative control 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cGMP did not. Fenoterol, forskolin and 6-Bnz-cAMP induced VASP phosphorylation, which was diminished by the PKA inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS. 6-Bnz-cAMP and 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP induced GTP-loading of Rap1, but not of Rap2. Treatment of the cells with toxin B-1470 and U0126 significantly reduced bradykinin-induced IL-8 release alone or in combination with the activators of PKA and Epac. Interestingly, inhibition of PKA by Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS and silencing of Epac1 and Epac2 expression by specific siRNAs largely decreased activation of Rap1 and the augmentation of bradykinin-induced IL-8 release by both PKA and Epac. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data suggest that PKA, Epac1 and Epac2 act in concert to modulate inflammatory properties of airway smooth muscle via signaling to the Ras-like GTPase Rap1 and to ERK1/2.
TI  - Chronic hepatitis, hepatic dysplasia, fibrosis, and biliary hyperplasia in hamsters naturally infected with a novel Helicobacter classified in the H. bilis cluster.
AB  - We recently described helicobacter-associated progressive, proliferative, and dysplastic typhlocolitis in aging (18- to 24-month-old) Syrian hamsters. Other pathogens associated with typhlocolitis in hamsters, Clostridium difficile, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Giardia spp., were not indentified. The presence of Helicobacter genus-specific DNA was noted by PCR in cecal and paraffin-embedded liver samples from aged hamsters by the use of Helicobacter-specific PCR primers. By 16S rRNA analysis, the Helicobacter sp. isolated from the liver tissue was identical to the cecal isolates from hamsters. The six hamster 16S rRNA sequences form a genotypic cluster most closely related to Helicobacter sp. Flexispira taxon 8, part of the Helicobacter bilis/H. cinaedi group. Livers from aged helicobacter-infected hamsters showed various stages of predominantly portocentric and, to a lesser extent, perivenular fibrosis. Within nodules, there was cellular atypia consistent with nodular dysplasia. The livers also exhibited a range of chronic active portal/interface and lobular inflammation, with significant portal hepatitis being present. The inflammation was composed of a mixture of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, indicative of its chronic-active nature in these aged hamsters infected with Helicobacter spp. The isolation of novel Helicobacter spp., their identification by PCR from the diseased livers of aged hamsters, and their taxonomic classification as belonging to the Helicobacter bilis cluster strengthen the argument that H. bilis and closely related Helicobacter spp. play an etiological role in hepatobiliary disease in both animals and humans.
TI  - A possible role for Clostridium difficile in the etiology of calf enteritis.
AB  - Clostridium difficile was investigated as a possible cause of enteritis in calves. The organism and its toxins (TcdA and TcdB), respectively, were found in 25.3% and 22.9% of stool samples from diarrheic calves. Culture positive samples were more likely than culture negative samples to be toxin positive. However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups. Lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates. Neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria. Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture. Toxins were found throughout the colon. Purified toxins A and B (individually and conjointly) caused comparable lesions, as well as fluid accumulation, in ligated intestinal loops. Our findings are in substantial agreement with those of others [Rodriguez-Palacios, A., Stampfli, H.R., Duffield, T., Peregrine, A.S., Trotz-Williams, L.A., Arroyo, L.G., Brazier, J.S., Weese, J.S., 2006. Clostridium difficile PCR ribotypes in calves, Canada. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 12, 1730-1736; Porter, M.C., Reggiardo, C., Bueschel, D.M., Keel, M.K., Songer, J.G., 2002. Association of Clostridium difficile with bovine neonatal diarrhea. Proc. 45th Ann. Mtg. Amer. Assoc. Vet. Lab. Diagn., St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.] and add strength to a working hypothesis that C. difficile infection and the accompanying intoxication can manifest as diarrhea in calves. It seems clear that calves serve as multiplying hosts for this organism.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea in the intensive care unit.
AB  - We made an epidemiological case-control study to examine risk factors for the development of diarrhea in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a public hospital in Santo Andre, SP, from January to October 2002. Forty-nine patients with diarrhea (cases) and 49 patients without diarrhea (controls), matched for age and gender, were included in the study. A stool culture and enzyme immunoassays for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B were performed on fecal specimens from diarrhea patients. Fourteen of them presented positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 22 patients presented positive ELISA for Clostridium difficile. Nosocomial diarrhea was associated with several factors, including use of antibiotics (P=0.001), use of ceftriaxone (P=0.001), presence of infection (P=0.010) and length of hospital stay (P=0.0001).
TI  - [Influence of selected Lactobacillus sp. on Clostridium difficile strains with different toxigenicity profile].
AB  - This study was performed for determination of antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus spp. (L. plantarum 2017405, L. rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus DSM 21007 and L. fernmentumn 353) on Clostridiunl difficile strains belonging to different toxigenicity profiles. Forty strains C. difficile isolated from patients suffering from antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) were used. Among C. difficile strains 13 produced toxin A and B (A+B+CDT-), 14 produced only toxin B (AB'CDT), 9 produced toxins A and B and possessing of binary toxin genes (A+B+CDT-) and 4 were non-toxigenic (A-B-CDT-). We did not observe relationship between degree of antagonistic activity Lactobacillus spp. and profile of toxigenicity of C. difficile strains.
TI  - In vitro killing of nosocomial pathogens by acid and acidified nitrite.
AB  - Exposure to pH 1 or 2 buffers or acidic gastric contents resulted in the killing  of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida glabrata but not Clostridium difficile spores. Nitrite enhanced killing under acidic conditions, but significant killing of C. difficile spores required nitrite concentrations above usual physiological levels.
TI  - Effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. However, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. Fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-O-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. Different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as Lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. This indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. Our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. The bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria as probiotics.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium sp, Saccharomyces boulardii, and some other microbes have been proposed as and are used as probiotic strains, i.e. live microorganisms as food supplement in order to benefit health. The health claims range from rather vague as regulation of bowel activity and increasing of well-being to more specific, such as exerting antagonistic effect on the gastroenteric pathogens Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori and rotavirus, neutralising food mutagens produced in colon, shifting the immune response towards a Th2 response, and thereby alleviating allergic reactions, and lowering serum cholesterol (Tannock, 2002). Unfortunately, most publications are case reports, uncontrolled studies in humans, or reports of animal or in vitro studies. Whether or not the probiotic strains employed shall be of human origin is a matter of debate but this is not a matter of concern, as long as the strains can be shown to survive the transport in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and to colonise the human large intestine. This includes survival in the stressful environment of the stomach - acidic pH and bile - with induction of new genes encoding a number of stress proteins. Since the availability of antioxidants decreases rostrally in the GI tract production of antioxidants by colonic bacteria provides a beneficial effect in scavenging free radicals. LAB strains commonly produce antimicrobial substance(s) with activity against the homologous strain, but LAB strains also often produce microbicidal substances with effect against gastric and intestinal pathogens and other microbes, or compete for cell surface and mucin binding sites. This could be the mechanism behind reports that some probiotic strains inhibit or decrease translocation of bacteria from the gut to the liver. A protective effect against cancer development can be ascribed to binding of mutagens by intestinal bacteria, reduction of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and deconjugation of bile acids, or merely by enhancing the immune system of the host. The latter has attracted considerable interest, and LAB have been tested in several clinical trials in allergic diseases. Characteristics ascribed to a probiotic strain are in general strain specific, and individual strains have to be tested for each property. Survival of strains during production, packing and storage of a viable cell mass has to be tested and declared.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial susceptibility of Clostridium difficile isolated from hospitalized children with acute diarrhea.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen associated with outbreaks of pseudomembranous colitis and other intestinal disorders such as diarrhea. In this study, 181 stool samples from children with and without acute diarrhea were analysed. Eighteen children with acute diarrhea were positive to C. ramosum, C. difficile, C. limosum, C. clostridioforme, C. septicum, C. butyricum, C. innocuum and Clostridium sp. Nineteen children without diarrhea harbored C. ramosum, C. septicum, C. barattii, C. butyricum, C. innocuum, C. sphenoides, C. bifermentans, C. clostridioforme and C. paraputrificum. No patient with diarrhea harbored C. barattii, C. bifermentans, C. paraputrificum and C. sphenoides. In addition, ten C. difficile strains were detected in 5 (5.5%) of the children with diarrhea. Also, no children from control group harbored C. difficile, C. limosum and Clostridium sp. Most of the tested strains were resistant to all the used antimicrobial. Nine C. difficile were toxigenic on VERO cells and by multiplex PCR, six strains showed both toxin A and B genes and three strains showed only toxin B gene. In this study, the presence of C. difficile was not significant, and it is suggested the need of more studies to evaluate the role of clostridia or C. difficile play in the childhood diarrhea and these organisms must be looked for routinely and a periodic evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility should be performed.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Small GTP-binding protein RhoB is expressed in glial Muller cells in the vertebrate retina.
AB  - Among several small Rho GTPases observed in the chick retina, RhoB was transiently expressed during development and mainly present in glial Muller cells in the adult. The aim of this study was to compare the distribution of RhoB in the chick and mouse adult retinas and to study its potential role in the maintenance of cell morphology. The distribution of RhoB was studied in situ and pure Muller cell cultures were submitted to Clostridium difficile toxin A and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) treatment in order to inactivate and activate Rho proteins, respectively. Cell morphology, F-actin arrangement, RhoB, and vimentin distribution were studied by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The results showed that, in both species, all vimentin-containing cells also expressed RhoB in situ and in vitro. Toxin A promoted cell rounding and detachment due to actin depolymerization, changing the distribution of RhoB only in chick cells. In serum-starved cells LPA stimulated actin polymerization and cell spreading, but only in chick cells was RhoB distribution recruited to expanding cellular processes and newly formed focal adhesions. These data suggest that, although RhoB is expressed by Muller cells in chick and mouse, its role in the maintenance of cellular morphology and regulation may be different. In addition, we show that RhoB may be an interesting Muller cell marker in the adult retina.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Clinical manifestations, treatment and control of infections caused by Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium difficile should be suspected in patients who present with nosocomial diarrhoea. It is more common in the elderly or in patients with a debilitating underlying condition who have received antimicrobial agents, and up to 20-25% of patients may experience a relapse. The reference method for diagnosis is the cell culture cytotoxin test which detects the presence of toxin B in a cellular culture of human fibroblasts, but recovering C. difficile in culture allows the performance of a ''second-look" cell culture assay that enhances the potential for diagnosis. Oral metronidazole (500 mg tid or 250 mg every 6 hrs) and oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 hrs) administered for 1014 days have similar therapeutic efficacy, with response rates near 90-97%. C. difficile strains resistant to metronidazole and with intermediate resistance to vancomycin have been described. The administration of probiotics such as Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus sp. or brewer's yeast for prophylaxis of CDAD remains controversial.
TI  - Parasites in nosocomial diarrhoea: are they underestimated?
AB  - Nosocomial diarrhoea, defined as diarrhoea occurring more than 72 h after hospital admission, is reported to account for <1% of endemic nosocomial infections and 17% of epidemic nosocomial infections. The yield of diagnoses from stool cultures in nosocomial diarrhoea is low, and information regarding the role of parasites is limited. We conducted a study to determine the responsible bacterial and parasitological pathogens from nosocomial diarrhoea cases in our 2000-bed tertiary care facility over a 16-month period. Of 226 patients, Clostridium difficile toxins A or B were present in 5.5%, giardia cysts and/or trophozoites in 4.4%, Blastocytis hominis in 4.4% and Cryptosporidium sp. in 0.5% of samples. In conclusion, parasites should be sought in nosocomial diarrhoea in endemic areas.
TI  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) requirement in Clostridium difficile toxin  A-mediated intestinal inflammation.
AB  - Clostridium difficile, the causative agent of antibiotic-associated colitis, mediates inflammatory diarrhea by releasing toxin A, a potent 308-kDa enterotoxin. Toxin A-induced inflammatory diarrhea involves many steps, including mucosal release of substance P (SP) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neutrophil transmigration. Here we demonstrate that, compared with wild type, mice genetically deficient in CRH (Crh(-/-)) have dramatically reduced ileal fluid secretion, epithelial cell damage, and neutrophil transmigration 4 h after intraluminal toxin A administration. This response is associated with diminished mucosal activity of the neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase compared with that of wildtype mice. In wild-type mice, toxin A stimulates an increase in intestinal SP content compared with buffer administration. In contrast, toxin A administration in Crh(-/-) mice fails to result in an increased SP content. Moreover, immunohistochemical experiments showed that CRH and SP are colocalized in some enteric nerves of wild-type mice, and this colocalization is more evident after toxin A administration. These results provide direct evidence for a major proinflammatory role for CRH in the pathophysiology of enterotoxin-mediated inflammatory diarrhea and indicate a SP-linked pathway.
TI  - [Treatment of infections associated with Clostridium difficile].
AB  - Cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) associated with toxigenic C. difficile strains more frequently are described recently. In Polish studies diagnosis of AAD or PMC (pseudomembranous colitis) was confirmed by isolation of C. difficile strains in 52% of suspected cases. Strains of C. difficile were isolated also from samples taken from hospital environment (10.5% positive samples). Problem of C. difficile-associated infection is more frequently observed in Poland also because of uncontrolled using of wide spectrum antibiotics. These antibiotics destroy intestinal microflora--"colonization resistance factor". Cases of AAD or PMC were described even after treatment of patients by vancomycin or metronidazol--antibiotics of choice for treatment of C. difficile-associated diseases. Other risk factors as: age, long term hospitalization, previous surgery, colonoscopy are also taken into account, when C. difficile-associated infections are suspected. Different treatment methods of C. difficile-associated infections are reviewed here and discussed in light of recent publications.
TI  - Prevalence of Clostridium spp. and Clostridium difficile in children with acute diarrhea in Sao Paulo city, Brazil.
AB  - Species of Clostridium are widely distributed in the environment, inhabiting both human and animal gastrointestinal tracts. Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen associated with outbreaks of pseudomembranous colitis and other intestinal disorders, such as diarrhea. In this study, the prevalence of Clostridium spp. and C. difficile, from hospitalized children with acute diarrhea, was examined. These children were admitted to 3 different hospitals for over 12 months. Eighteen (20%) and 19 (21%) stool specimens from children with (90) and without (91) diarrhea respectively, were positive to clostridia. Only 10 C. difficile strains were detected in 5.5% of the stool samples of children with diarrhea. None healthy children (without diarrhea) harbored C. difficile. From these 10 C. difficile, 9 were considered as toxigenic and genotyped as tcdA+/tcdB+ or tcdA-/tcdB+, and 1 strain as nontoxigenic (tcdA-/tdcB-). They were detected by the citotoxicity on VERO cells and by the multiplex-polymerase chain reaction. Thirty clinical fecal extracts produced minor alterations on VERO cells. The presence of C. difficile as a probable agent of acute diarrhea is suggested in several countries, but in this study, the presence of these organisms was not significant. More studies will be necessary to evaluate the role of clostridia or C. difficile in diarrhoeal processes in children.
TI  - Toxin B of Clostridium difficile activates human VIP submucosal neurons, in part  via an IL-1beta-dependent pathway.
AB  - This study investigated whether toxin B of Clostridium difficile can activate human submucosal neurons and the involved pathways. Isolated segments of human colon were placed in organ culture for 3 h in the presence of toxin B or IL-1beta. Whole mounts of internal submucosal plexus were stained with antibodies against c-Fos, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and substance P (SP). The membrane potential (Vm) response of submucosal neurons to local application of toxin B and IL-1beta was determined by a multisite optical recording technique. Toxin B (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) increased the proportion of c-Fos-positive neurons dose dependently compared with the control. In the presence of toxin B (10 ng/ml), most c-Fos-positive neurons were immunoreactive for VIP (79.8 +/- 22.5%) but only 19.4 +/- 14.0% for SP. Toxin B induced a rapid rise in IL-1beta mRNA level and a sixfold increase in IL-1beta protein in supernatant after 3 h of incubation. c-Fos expression induced by toxin B was reduced dose dependently by IL-1 receptor antagonist (0.1-10 ng/ml). IL-1beta significantly increased c-Fos expression in submucosal neurons compared with the control (34.2 +/- 10.1 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.3% of NSE neurons). Microejection of toxin B had no effect on the Vm of enteric neurons. Evidence of a direct excitatory effect of IL-1beta on Vm was detected in a minority of enteric neurons. Therefore, toxin B of C. difficile activates VIP-positive submucosal neurons, at least in part, via an indirect IL-1beta-dependent pathway.
TI  - Endocannabinoids induce ileitis in rats via the capsaicin receptor (VR1).
AB  - Intraluminal administration of the endocannabinoids N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) causes inflammation similar to that caused by Clostridium difficile toxin A in the rat ileum. The effects of anandamide and 2-AG were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the specific capsaicin receptor (vanilloid receptor subtype 1; VR1) antagonist capsazepine. Pretreatment with the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor antagonists N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazole-carbox amide (SR141716) and N-[1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl) -1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR144528) did not affect the responses to anandamide. It has previously been shown that intraluminal toxin A stimulates substance P (SP) release from primary sensory neurons and that pretreatment with SP receptor [neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor] antagonists inhibits the inflammatory effects of toxin A. Anandamide stimulated SP release and this was blocked by capsazepine pretreatment. Also, pretreatment with the specific NK-1 receptor antagonist (2S,3S)-3-([3,5-bis[trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methoxy)-2-phenylpiperidine (L-733,060) significantly inhibited the inflammatory effects of both toxin A and anandamide. Toxin A increased tissue concentrations of anandamide and 2-AG in the ileum, and these effects were enhanced after pretreatment with inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase, a major endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme. The toxin A-stimulated release of anandamide but not 2-AG was selective over their congeners. These results demonstrate that the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG stimulate intestinal primary sensory neurons via the capsaicin VR1 receptor to release SP, resulting in enteritis, and that endocannabinoids may mediate the inflammatory effects of toxin A.
TI  - Structural microdomains in the lateral plasma membrane of cochlear outer hair cells.
AB  - The basal and lateral regions of the plasma membrane of cochlear outer hair cells are structurally and functionally distinct. The lateral region contains thousands of motor proteins but few voltage-gated channels. The basal region, conversely, contains a high number of voltage-gated channels but is devoid of motor proteins. It has been suggested that the cortical cytoskeleton is responsible for maintaining this regional distinction. Toward elucidating the structure of the outer hair cell's electromotile mechanism, we investigated the physical organization of the lateral plasma membrane in living guinea pig outer hair cells by analyzing the distribution pattern of the anionic long-chain carbocyanine SP-DiIC18(3) within this area, before and after electrical stimulation and with an intact and a disrupted cytoskeleton. We observed punctate, intensely fluorescent patches as well as areas of weaker fluorescence, with clear local maxima and minima, upon labeling the cells with this membrane-soluble probe. This discrete distribution of SP-DilC18(3) suggests that the lateral plasma membrane of guinea pig outer hair cells may be composed of small structural domains (microdomains). Disrupting the cytoskeleton with either trypsin or toxin B from Clostridium difficile did not change this pattern of distribution, thus indicating that this treatment did not facilitate the lateral diffusion of the probes. Electrical stimulation using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, on the other hand, induced two responses: fast motility and reversible displacement of the fluorescent probes. Both responses were inhibited by internal perfusion with salicylate, while disruption of the cytoskeleton did not inhibit OHC fast motility but affected the electrically induced redistribution of fluorescent probes. Together, these results suggest that the lateral plasma membrane of guinea pig outer hair cells contains structural microdomains and that the cytoskeleton does not appear to be playing a major role in maintaining the lateral separation of these distinct molecular regions.
TI  - [Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection].
AB  - Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC), antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), and colitis (AAC) caused by Clostridium difficile are recognized as complications of antibiotic treatment (cephalosporins, penicillins, clindamycin and others). Two groups are particularly at risk: older and immunocompromised patients. In recent years C. difficile has been recognized as a common nosocomial pathogen. To understand the epidemiology of the C. difficile infection, many outbreaks have been investigated by various methods. In the paper we reviewed different methods of C. difficile typing and discussed the epidemiology of C. difficile-associated infections in light of recent publications.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) against 469 less frequently identified anaerobes isolated from human infections.
AB  - We studied the in vitro activity of ertapenem against 469 less frequently identified anaerobes from 11 genera and 52 species isolated from human infections. Ertapenem was uniformly active against 460 of 469 (98%) strains at concentrations of < or = 4 microg/ml. Only 4 of 14 Clostridium difficile, 1 of 11 Clostridium innocuum, and 4 of 6 Lactobacillus sp. strains required ertapenem concentrations of > or = 8 microg/ml for inhibition.
TI  - The capsaicin VR1 receptor mediates substance P release in toxin A-induced enteritis in rats.
AB  - The mechanism by which Clostridium difficile toxin A causes substance P (SP) release and subsequent inflammation in the rat ileum is unknown. Pretreatment with the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) antagonist, capsazepine, before toxin A administration significantly inhibited toxin A-induced SP release and intestinal inflammation. Intraluminal administration of the VR1 agonist capsaicin caused intestinal inflammation similar to the effects of toxin A. Pretreatment with capsazepine before capsaicin administration also significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced intestinal inflammation. These results suggest that intraluminal toxin A causes SP release from primary sensory neurons via stimulation of VR1 receptors resulting in intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Deletion of neutral endopeptidase exacerbates intestinal inflammation induced by  Clostridium difficile toxin A.
AB  - Toxin A (TxA) of Clostridium difficile induces acute inflammation of the intestine initiated by release of substance P (SP) and activation of the neurokinin-1 receptor. However, the mechanisms that terminate this response are unknown. We determined whether the SP-degrading enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) terminates TxA-induced enteritis. We used both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of NEP to test this hypothesis. In wild-type mice, instillation of TxA (0.5-5 microg) into ileal loops for 3 h dose dependently increased ileal fluid secretion, stimulated granulocyte transmigration determined by myeloperoxidase activity, and caused histological damage characterized by depletion of enterocytes, edema, and neutrophil accumulation. Deletion of NEP reduced the threshold secretory and inflammatory dose of TxA and exacerbated the inflammatory responses by more than twofold. This exacerbated inflammation was prevented by pretreatment with recombinant NEP. Conversely, pretreatment of wild-type mice with the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon exacerbated enteritis. Thus NEP terminates enteritis induced by C. difficile TxA, underlying the importance of SP degradation in limiting neurogenic inflammation.
TI  - Effects of Clostridium difficile toxins on epithelial cell barrier.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the primary agent responsible for many patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and almost all patients with pseudomembranous colitis following antibiotic therapy. C. difficile infection is the most frequent form of colitis in hospitals and nursing homes and affects millions of patients in the United States and abroad. The first event in the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection involves alterations of the indigenous colonic microflora by antibiotics, followed by colonization with C. difficile. C. difficile causes diarrhea and colitis by releasing two high molecular weight protein exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, with potent cytotoxic and enterotoxic properties. Evidence presented here indicates that C. difficile toxins compromise the epithelial cell barrier by at least two pathophysiologic pathways, one involving disaggregation of actin microfilaments in colonocytes via glucosylation of the Rho family of proteins leading to epithelial cell destruction and opening of the tight junctions, whereas the other appears to involve early release of proinflammatory cytokines from intestinal epithelial cells probably via activation of MAP kinases. We speculate that cytokines released from intestinal epithelial cells in response to toxin A exposure will diffuse into the lamina propria and activate macrophages, enteric nerves, and sensory neurons to release SP, CGRP, and NT, which, in turn, interact with immune and inflammatory cells and amplify the inflammatory response. Dissection of this inflammatory cascade may help us understand the pathophysiology of inflammatory diarrhea caused by this important pathogen.
TI  - Novel targets for the pharmacotherapy of diarrhoea: a view for the millennium.
AB  - Acute diarrhoea continues to carry a high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Intestinal infection is the major cause of acute diarrhoea although the prevalence of individual pathogens varies according to geographic location. In many countries in the industrialized world, reports of intestinal infections continue to increase; these are largely related to waterborne and foodborne outbreaks. Acute diarrhoea may be due to increased intestinal secretion, commonly as a result of infection with enterotoxin-producing organisms (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae) or to decreased intestinal absorption from infection with organisms that damage the intestinal epithelium (enteropathogenic E. coli, Shigella sp., Salmonella sp.). Although oral rehydration therapy has reduced the mortality associated with acute diarrhoea, the diarrhoea attack rate remains unchanged and stool volume often increases during the rehydration process. The search for agents that will directly inhibit intestinal secretory mechanisms and thereby reduce stool volume has been going on for more than 20 years. Research during the past decade has highlighted the importance of neurohumoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea, notably the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and neural reflexes within the enteric nervous system. Cholera toxin, E. coli enterotoxins and Clostridium difficile toxin A are known to invoke these mechanisms in diarrhoea pathogenesis. This new dimension of intestinal pathophysiology has already exposed possible novel targets for anti-secretory therapy, namely, 5-HT receptor antagonists, substance P antagonists and the possibility for potentiating the proabsorptive effects of endogenous enkephalins by use of enkephalinase inhibitors. There now seems to be a real possibility that anti-secretory therapy will become more widely available in the future.
TI  - The role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  - The use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. Probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. There is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. However, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. Currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. However, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. Some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. Probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including Clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Shigella, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. Probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. There are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. Probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - Chronic diarrhoea among HIV-infected adult patients in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic diarrhoea and wasting are well recognized features of AIDS in Africa. However, because of resource constraints few comprehensive aetiological studies have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. We undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoea; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. METHODS: Stool specimens from 75 consecutive HIV-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoea admitted to a Nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. Stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of Escherichia coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin. Blood cultures for mycobacteria and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being Cryptosporidium sp. (17%), Salmonella typhimurium (13%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). Of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli and diffusely adherent E. coli were each found in four patients. Thirty-one (41%) patients died. Detection of cryptosporidium cysts was the single most significant predictor of death (X2 = 5.2, P<0.05). Many patients did not improve (21; 28%) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in Nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. The most important step is to exclude tuberculosis; and the most useful investigation appears to be Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Other potentially treatable gram-negative bacterial pathogens, S. typhimurium, Shigella sp. and adherent E. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification. Further studies focussing on simple ways to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable infections are warranted.
TI  - Substance P receptor expression in intestinal epithelium in clostridium difficile toxin A enteritis in rats.
AB  - We previously reported that the inflammatory effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A on rat intestine can be significantly inhibited with a specific neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist. In this study we investigated the localization and expression of NK-1R mRNA and protein in rat intestine by in situ hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry, respectively, after exposure to toxin A. Northern blot analysis showed increased mucosal levels of NK-1R mRNA starting 30 min after toxin A administration. In situ hybridization showed that toxin A increased NK-1R mRNA expression in intestinal epithelial cells after 30, 120, and 180 min. In rats pretreated with the NK-1R antagonist CP-96345 the increase in NK-1R mRNA levels after exposure to toxin A was inhibited, indicating that NK-1R upregulation is substance P (SP) dependent. One hour after exposure to toxin A many of the intestinal epithelial cells showed staining for NK-1R compared with controls. Specific 125I-SP binding to purified epithelial cell membranes obtained from ileum exposed to toxin A for 15 min was increased twofold over control and persisted for 4 h. This report provides evidence that NK-1R expression is increased in the intestinal epithelium shortly after exposure to toxin A and may be important in toxin A-induced inflammation.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Increased substance P responses in dorsal root ganglia and intestinal macrophages during Clostridium difficile toxin A enteritis in rats.
AB  - Previously we reported that pretreatment of rats with the substance P (SP) antagonist CP-96,345 inhibits the enterotoxic responses following administration of toxin A from Clostridium difficile into ileal loops, indicating that SP participates in the intestinal responses to this toxin. We now report that injection of toxin A into rat ileum causes a rapid increase in SP content in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and mucosal scrapings 30-60 min after toxin A administration. Toxin A-mediated fluid secretion, mannitol permeability, and ileal histologic damage is significantly increased only after 2 hr. Toxin A also causes an increase in the abundance of SP mRNA in lumbar DRG and ileal mucosa as measured by reverse transcription-PCR. Lamina propria macrophages (LPMs) obtained from toxin A-injected loops release greater amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and SP as compared with LPMs isolated from buffer-injected loops (P < 0.01). Pretreatment of rats with the SP antagonist CP-96,345 inhibits toxin A-mediated TNFalpha release from isolated LPMs, whereas an inactive enantiomer (CP-96,344) of the SP antagonist has no effect. LPMs obtained from toxin A-injected ileal loops incubated in vitro with SP (10(-8) to 10(-9) M) show enhanced TNFalpha secretion, whereas LPMs isolated from buffer-injected loops do not respond to SP. In addition, LPMs obtained from toxin A-injected ileal loops incubated in vitro with CP-96,345 showed a diminished TNFalpha release. Our results indicate that activated LPMs secrete SP during toxin A enteritis that can lead to secretion of cytokines, suggesting an autocrine/paracrine regulation of cytokine secretion by SP from LPMs during intestinal inflammation.
TI  - The intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. In infants delivered by Caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. The first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. Among them, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from the newborn faecal flora at birth. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by Bifidobacterium sp. Clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a Caesarean section. Clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp. The impact of Caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. Feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. In humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. Formula feeding seems to promote implantation and persistence of Clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of C. difficile in newborns.
TI  - [Perioperative managements for postoperative severe infections in compromised host].
AB  - The incidence of postoperative infections, especially due to multi-drug resistant strains such as Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp., and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is high in compromised hosts. Among them, respiratory infection, catheter sepsis, and drug-associated enteritis are frequently observed and respiratory infection is liable to fall into serious illness. These infections have characteristics in causative organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or MRSA are frequently isolated in respiratory infections and Candida or coagulase-negative staphylococcus are frequently isolated in catheter sepsis. G-test in addition to blood culture is necessary for early diagnosis of Candida sepsis, vancomycin should be administered in early phase of antibiotic-associated enteritis, since this infection is usually caused by MRSA or Clostridium difficile and frequently falls into serious illness. The patients with protein-calorie malnutrition, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, diabetes melitis, administration of anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy, serious injury, or severe operative stress are considered to be compromised hosts in surgical field, and the adequate perioperative managements according to these disorders should be carried out against postoperative infections.
TI  - Substance P activation of enteric neurons in response to intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A in the rat ileum.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nerves have been suggested to mediate the effects of bacterial toxins in intestinal diseases. However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. This study examined endogenous substance P (SP) activation of the substance P receptor (SPR) on enteric neurons in the rat ileum after exposure to intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A. METHODS: After intraluminal injection of toxin A in ileal loops, tissue was examined for pathological changes by histology and for SPR activation by immunocytochemical analysis of SP-induced SPR endocytosis. RESULTS: After toxin A administration, > 70% of enteric neurons showed SPR endocytosis and became swollen with thickened dendrites. In contrast, SPRs in control rats were largely confined to the plasma membrane. Rats denervated of primary afferent fibers with neonatal capsaicin injection and animals pretreated with a nonpeptide SPR antagonist showed few endosomal SPRs, and the pathological inflammatory effects of toxin A were ablated. CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal toxin A causes the release of SP from primary afferent neurons: this endogenous SP then acts on enteric neurons in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. SP is the primary mediator of an axon reflex mediating neurogenic inflammation in the intestine. SPR blockade may prove to be a novel therapy used to prevent intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Increased substance P receptor expression by blood vessels and lymphoid aggregates in Clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembranous colitis.
AB  - Pseudomembranous colitis is most often caused by toxins secreted by Clostridium difficile following bowel flora overgrowth after antibiotic use. The secretory and inflammatory effects observed in C. difficile toxin A-induced enterocolitis in the rat ileum are inhibited by CP-96,345, a substance P (SP) receptor antagonist. To determine if SP plays a role in the pathogenesis of human pseudomembranous colitis, SP receptor distribution was examined in a toxin A-positive specimen of bowel. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to examine SP receptors in tissue from a patient who tested positive for C. Difficile toxin. SP receptors were massively increased in small blood vessels and lymphoid aggregates in the pseudomembranous colitis bowel in comparison to control specimens. The SP binding was saturable and exhibited similar affinities for SP and CP-96,345. SP may contribute to the inflammatory response in pseudomembranous colitis via a massive increase in SP receptor antagonists may offer a novel therapeutic intervention for pseudomembranous colitis.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - [Etiology, diagnosis and course of infectious diarrhea in the Liestal canton hospital (5-year retrospective study)].
AB  - Between 1987 and 1991 219 patients (1.3% of all hospitalized patients) with acute infectious diarrhea were investigated retrospectively. 52% of the patients were hospitalized and 48% were outpatients. In 55% the inducing diarrhea microorganism could be identified. The most frequently detected pathogens were endemic Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter jejuni (65%). Imported diarrheas (Shigella sp. and parasites) were rare, as only 15% of the patients had a history of travel. All Clostridium difficile infections were associated with antibiotic treatment. The stool examinations for bacteria were positive in 92/160 patients (57%). Stool examinations for occult blood or fecal leukocytes were highly useful in detecting the infectious agent. In 70% of the patients with positive occult blood test or 81% of the patients with fecal leukocytes, an infectious agent in the stool was found. All patients recovered with few complications. 31% of the patients were treated by antibiotics because of septic disease or pathogenic parasites.
TI  - New selective medium for isolating Clostridium difficile from faeces.
AB  - AIMS: To compare CCFA (cycloserine, cefoxitin fructose agar) with a new selective medium CDMN (containing cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin, and moxalactam) for the isolation of Clostridium difficile after direct faecal culture. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of norfloxacin was determined for 64 strains of C difficile, 17 strains of other Clostridium sp, and 66 various isolates of faecal origin, together with MIC determinations of moxalactam against the 81 strains of Clostridium sp and 15 isolates of Bacteroides sp. Using C difficile agar base with 0.5 g/l of cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin and moxalactam were incorporated into the medium and compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile after direct faecal culture. RESULTS: Norfloxacin (12 mg/l) inhibited the growth of enterobacteriaceae and faecal streptococci; moxalactam (32 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most strains of Bacteroides sp tested, together with Clostridium sp other than C difficile. Using the antibiotics in combination (CDMN), the growth and colonial morphology of 64 strains of C difficile were unaffected. When CDMN medium was compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile from 832 faeces from inpatients with diarrhoea, the CDMN agar isolated 20% more strains and reduced the number of contaminating colonies by 30%. CONCLUSIONS: CDMN both improves the isolation rate of C difficile from faecal specimens and reduces the growth of other organisms compared with CCFA.
TI  - Characterization of rabbit ileal receptors for Clostridium difficile toxin A. Evidence for a receptor-coupled G protein.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the surface receptor for toxin A, the enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, on rabbit intestinal brush borders (BB) and on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Purified toxin A was radiolabeled using a modified Bolton-Hunter method to sp act 2 microCi/micrograms, with retention of full biologic activity. 3H-Toxin A bound specifically to a single class of receptors on rabbit BB and on RBL cells with dissociation constants of 5.4 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. RBL cells were highly sensitive to toxin A (cell rounding) and had 180,000 specific binding sites per cell, whereas IMR-90 fibroblasts were far less sensitive to toxin A and lacked detectable specific binding sites. Exposure of BB to trypsin or chymotrypsin significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Preincubation of BB with Bandeirea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin also reduced specific binding, and CHAPS-solubilized receptors could be immobilized with WGA-agarose. The addition of 100 nM toxin A accelerated the association of 35S-GTP gamma S with rabbit ileal BB, and preincubation of BB with the GTP analogues GTP gamma S or Gpp(NH)p, significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Our data indicate that the membrane receptor for toxin A is a galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine-containing glycoprotein which appears to be coupled to a G protein.
TI  - Value of Clostridium difficile antigen test in immunocompromised hosts in the tropics.
AB  - 39 fecal and body fluid specimens of immunocompromised patients who developed diarrhoea were tested for Clostridium difficile antigen test. The test was identified in only 11 and in one ascitic fluid. Endoscopy was performed in 5 patients and it showed pseudomembranous colitis in one. Numerous antibiotics were associated with C. difficile related diarrhea: ampicillin, 43%; cephalosporins, 43% and clindamycin, 14%. Three Salmonella sp., and one Entamoeba histolytica were detected among patients who later developed C. difficile associated diarrhea. The effect of oral vancomycin and fusidic acid was demonstrated in patients with C. difficile related diarrhea or colitis. The C. difficile antigen test is promising diagnostic tool in immunocompromised hosts in the tropics where both Salmonella and E. histolytica all are endemic.
TI  - [Influence of cefodizime via intravenous bolus injection on human fecal flora].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was given to 8 healthy male volunteers with ages 23-28 years (mean: 24 years) and body weights 54-73 kg (mean: 64 kg). 4 volunteers received 2 g b.i.d., intravenous infusion for 5 days, and 4 volunteers had 4 g b.i.d. for the same duration. We studied changes in bacterial flora and drug levels in feces, as well as changes in susceptibility of isolated microbes to CDZM, cefmetazole, cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone. Adverse drug reactions and changes in laboratory findings were also investigated. The following results were obtained. 1. In fecal flora for the 2 g b.i.d. group, on day 3 of treatment Enterobacteriaceae were identified in only 2 of the 4 cases. Individual microbe counts decreased or fell below detection limit (10(2) cells/g) on day 3 of treatment. Colony forming units (CFUs) of Enterobacteriaceae on day 5 of treatment were similar to those on day 3. After the end of treatment, its CFUs increased. The mean CFU of Enterobacteriaceae on day 10 after the end of treatment increased to about the same level as before dosing. However, some microbes did not revert to pretreatment levels. Of other Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas sp. increased in one case transiently on day 3 of treatment. After day 3 of treatment, its CFU decreased. Gram-positive microbes showed various changes. Mean CFU of yeast like organism (YLO) increased between day 3 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment and its mean CFU decreased on day 10 after the treatment. As for anaerobes, CFUs of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms and overall anaerobes showed no distinctive changes. Clostridium difficile were detected in two cases. In one case, C. difficile was noted at levels between 1.1 X 10(3) cells/g and 2.0 X 10(6) cells/g at the following sampling times: days 1 and 3 of treatment and days 3, 5, 10 and 20 after the end of treatment. In other case, it was noted at levels of 1.8 X 10(5) cells/g on day 20 after the end of treatment. D-1 toxin was detected in one case before dosing, and in three cases (the concentration of D-1 toxin was 250 ng/g or 500 ng/g) on day after treatment. Enterobacteriaceae in fecal flora of 4 cases given 4 g b.i.d. frequently decreased or fell below detection limit on days 3 and 5 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - [Effect of rokitamycin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Rokitamycin, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic was orally administered to 7  healthy male volunteers (22-25 years) for 7 consecutive days to study changes in bacterial flora and concentrations of the drug in feces, and to observe adverse reactions and laboratory test parameters. A dose of 200 mg (2 tablets: 100 mg/tablet) was given 3 times daily before meals and the fecal studies were done on the 5 days before administration (adm.) [b.a.], at the time of administration (0), and the 3rd, 5th, 7th (the final day of treatment) days during adm. [u.a.] and the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th days after adm. [a.a.]. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Obvious changes in mean populations of total aerobes and enterobacteriaceae were not found. In changes of each bacteria of enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli was not observed in cases from initial day of treatment to the 3rd day a.a. Cases from which Citrobacter sp. was isolated tended to increase after 3 days u.a. and gradually decrease after 3 days a.a. Among Gram-negative bacilli, cases where isolation of Pseudomonas sp. was observed increased temporarily on the 3rd u.a., Gram-positive cocci did not show particular patterns of changes. No changes in mean count of total anaerobes were observed during the course of the experiment. Among individual anaerobes, numbers of Lactobacillus and Peptococcaceae decreased slightly from the 3rd day u.a. and returned on the 5th day a.a. 2. Clostridium difficile D-1 toxin was detected in feces at amounts approximately 500 ng/g in 2 cases each on 20th and 30th day a.a., with 1 incidence occurring in the same person on the 2 separate days. 3. The drug was detected in all 7 cases on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days u.a., and in 1 cases each on the 5th and the 30th day a.a. The mean peak level was 315.5 micrograms/g on the 7th day u.a. The reason for the detection of the drug in feces in 1 case on the 30th day a.a. at a value of 5.90 micrograms/g was not clear. 4. Adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results due to this drug were not observed in any cases.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - Bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing Clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  - Six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in sterile saline (five patients). The mixture led to a prompt loss of Cl difficile and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by Bacteroides sp, which had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. Strains of Escherichia coli, Cl bifermentans, and Peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of Cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The finding that Bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was present after recovery suggests that the absence of Bacteroides sp may result in chronic relapsing Cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by Cl difficile.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefotaxime against clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - The present in vitro antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and 8 other cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefpiramide, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotiam and cephazolin) were evaluated simultaneously in 384 strains of Gram-positive cocci, 595 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 240 strains of non-fermenters and 143 strains of anaerobes and miscellaneous organisms. The results were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, MIC50 and MIC90. Of the beta-lactams, cefotaxime and latamoxef exhibited the highest activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. MIC90 of cefotaxime, however, for species of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, enterococci, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile were more than 100 mg/L. Cefpiramide and cefoperazone were generally less active than these 2 agents. All strains were tested for beta-lactamase production by the cefinase disc method and the relationship of susceptibility to beta-lactams was evaluated in each species. The need was demonstrated for periodic susceptibility testing to be performed to better guide empirical antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Production of a unique cytotoxin by Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide; the mechanisms by which it causes disease remain unclear. Because of its association with inflammatory diarrhea, we postulated that C. jejuni might produce a cytotoxin similar to that produced by Shigella sp., enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157, or Clostridium difficile. Filtrates of 12 polymyxin-treated isolates of C. jejuni were placed on HeLa cells (sensitive to Shiga toxin cytotoxicity) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Of 12 isolates of C. jejuni tested, 5 killed 50% of the cells at greater than or equal to 1:4 dilutions of filtered suspensions of 10(9) bacteria per ml; killing was similar in HeLa and CHO cells (the CHO cells being insensitive to Shiga cytotoxin). One isolate produced a titer of 1:32 to 1:128. The relative potency in HeLa cells was comparable to that of E. coli strains that produce intermediate amounts of Shiga-like toxin. The other seven strains showed no cytotoxic effect, nor did the control diluents, polymyxin B, or supernatants of C. jejuni not treated with polymyxin B. Sonication also released active cytotoxin, but slightly less well than did polymyxin. The cytotoxic effect was dose dependent. Concentration of the C. jejuni in suspension by 10-fold before treatment with polymyxin B resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 50% cytotoxic dose. The cytotoxin effect was not neutralized by Shiga toxin immune serum against either Shiga-like toxin I or II or by anti-Clostridium difficile antiserum. The C jejuni cytotoxin was partially labile to trypsin (0.25%) and to heating to greater than or equal to 60 degrees C. Cytotoxicity was retained in Scientific Products dialysis tubing D1615-1 (Mr cutoff, 12,000 to 14,000). Some isolates of C. jejuni release a substance lethal to HeLa or CHO cells in vitro that is distinct from Shiga-like or Clostridium difficile toxin. This cytotoxin may contribute to the colonic mucosal invasive process that characterizes C. jejuni enteritis.
TI  - [In vitro activity of roxithromycin, new semisynthetic macrolide against obligate anaerobes].
AB  - The "in vitro" susceptibility to roxithromycin and three other macrolides of 236  anaerobes isolated from clinical samples in 1984/1985 was determined by an agar-dilution method on Wilkins Chalgren medium. 90% of Gram positive cocci were susceptible to both roxithromycin and josamycin (MIC less than 1 mg/l, whereas 1 mg/l erythromycin and 2 mg/l spiramycin were able to inhibit respectively 46 and 86% of the same tested strains. No resistance to the four macrolides was observed among Eubacterium, propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium. Two C. perfringens strains and one C. difficile strain were resistant to all four macrolides, while 97% of Clostridium sp. strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l erythromycin, josamycin or roxithromycin. Against Gram positive anaerobes, roxithromycin was equal or superior to erythromycin and spiramycin. At a concentration of 4 mg/l, roxithromycin inhibited 82% of B. fragilis strains. Roxithromycin and josamycin were more active against Gram negative bacilli that erythromycin and spiramycin. Macrolides had no effect on Fusobacterium strains. In this study, 4 mg/l roxithromycin inhibited 217 of the 236 anaerobic strains investigated (92%).
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - In vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on Clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of sulphasalazine (SASP), azodisal sodium (ADS), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. Sulphapyridine (SP) had a mild to moderate effect on Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. SASP also had a growth-inhibitory effect on Strep. faecalis. The other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. SASP, SP, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. Of special interest was the inhibitory effect on Clostridium difficile strains. In recent years the possibility that overgrowth of Cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Some studies suggested that SASP treatment could predispose to Cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found SASP more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. Our findings support the theory that SASP treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of Cl. difficile superinfection.
TI  - Etiology of acute infectious diarrhea in a highly industrialized area of Switzerland.
AB  - During an 18-mo period between 1981 and 1982, a prospective study was conducted in 119 adult patients with acute diarrhea. A diarrhea-inducing microorganism or toxin could be identified in 38.7% of the patients. Salmonella sp and Campylobacter jejuni were the leading agents that caused diarrheal illness in 25% of the investigated population. Clostridium difficile was found in 6%, mainly after previous antibiotic therapy. Rotavirus was rarely isolated and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were not found. Clinical features in patients in whom an invasive agent was isolated did not differ from those in patients in whom no enteropathogens were found, although the occurrence of fecal leukocytes and positive hemoccult tests in the former group was significantly more frequent. More than 30% of the patients with negative stool cultures, however, showed fecal leukocytes and positive occult blood, which is suggestive of the existence of one or more invasive agent(s) so far unknown or not recognized.
TI  - Piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  - Piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing S. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis. Piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella sp and Pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. Like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. The primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. Piperacillin has been approved for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. As with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. The usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. It is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. Less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. Overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. Evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) and  to other antibiotics.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 462 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates to N-formimidoyl thienamycin and 16 other currently available and investigational antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution technique. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most organisms tested, especially Bacteroides sp., including clindamycin-resistant strains. All 462 isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and no resistant strains were found in the species tested. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was less active (i.e., had a higher 50% minimal inhibitory concentration) against Fusobacterium sp. than clindamycin, SM-1652, and piperacillin, and less active against Clostridium difficile than metronidazole, but was equally active or more active than the other reference antibiotics tested.
TI  - Relative frequency of Clostridium difficile in patients with diarrheal disease.
AB  - We have studied 161 patients with diarrheal disease to determine the frequency with which Clostridium difficile occurs in such patients. C. difficile or its toxin or both were detected in stools from 19 patients (11.9%), 17 of whom had previously received antimicrobial agents. Enteric pathogens other than C. difficile were recovered less frequently, with Salmonella sp., Giardia lamblia, and Campylobacter fetus being recovered from 4.1, 2.5, and 1.3%, respectively, of the patients studied. These data suggest that C. difficile may be frequently encountered in specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea who receive antibiotics and may play a role in diarrheal disease in such patients.
TI  - Effects of Clostridium difficile, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus sp. on anomalous lower bowel function on germfree mice.
AB  
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
