TI  == identification and genetics of 6-thioguanine secreted by erwinia species and its  interference with the growth of other bacteria.
AB  == we identified a compound in culture supernatants of erwinia species, such as erwinia amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis, e. persicina and e. rhapontici absorbing at 340 nm, which was associated before with the yellow pigment produced by e. amylovora on media containing copper ions. the compound was purified from e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on dowex-1 and dowex-50 columns and identified by hplc/ms and nmr  analysis as 6-thioguanine (6tg). its signal at 167 da matched with the expected molecular mass. by random mutagenesis with minitn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. a specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three erwinia species  and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6tg synthesis and secretion in e. coli, when the bacteria were grown in  minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6tg was bacteriostatic for e. coli  and salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. similar results were obtained with p. agglomerans strains. bacteria from the genus pectobacterium were barely and rahnella or gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6tg. adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6tg on e.  coli. non-producing strains were fully virulent on host plants. 6tg synthesis may help erwinias to interfere with growth of some microorganisms in the environment.

TI  == growth inhibition of erwinia amylovora and related erwinia species by neutralized shortchain fatty acids.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are used to preserve food and could be a tool for control of fire blight caused by erwinia amylovora on apple, pear and related rosaceous plants. neutralized acids were added to buffered growth media at 0.5-75 mm and tested at phs ranging from 6.8 to 5.5. particularly at low ph, scfas with  a chain length exceeding that of acetic acid such as propionic acid were effective growth inhibitors of e. amylovora possibly due to uptake of free acid and its intracellular accumulation. we also observed high inhibition with monochloroacetic acid. an e. billingiae strain was as sensitive to the acids as e. amylovora or e. tasmaniensis. fire blight symptoms on pear slices were reduced when the slices were pretreated with neutralized propionic acid. propionic acid is well water soluble and could be applied in orchards as a control agent for fire blight.

TI  == identification of erwinia species isolated from apples and pears by differential  pcr.
AB  == many pathogenic and epiphytic bacteria isolated from apples and pears belong to the genus erwinia; these include the species e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. persicina, e. rhapontici and e. tasmaniensis. identification and classification of freshly isolated bacterial species often requires tedious taxonomic procedures. to facilitate routine identification of erwinia species, we have developed a pcr method based on species-specific oligonucleotides (ssos) from the sequences of the housekeeping genes reca and gpd. using species-specific primers that we report here, differentiation was done with conventional pcr (cpcr) and quantitative pcr (qpcr) applying two consecutive primer annealing temperatures. the specificity of the primers depends on terminal single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) that are characteristic for the target species. these pcr assays enabled us to distinguish eight erwinia species, as well as to identify new erwinia isolates from plant surfaces. when performed with mixed bacterial cultures, they only detected a single target species. this method is a  novel approach to classify strains within the genus erwinia by pcr and it can be  used to confirm other diagnostic data, especially when specific pcr detection methods are not already available. the method may be applied to classify species  within other bacterial genera.

TI  == functions and origin of plasmids in species that are pathogenic to or epiphytically associated with pome fruit trees.
AB  == the genus erwinia includes plant-associated pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. among them, all species pathogenic to pome fruit trees (e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. piriflorinigrans, erwinia sp. from japan) cause similar symptoms,  but differ in their degrees of aggressiveness, i.e. in symptoms, host range or both. the presence of plasmids of similar size, in the range of 30 kb, is a common characteristic that they possess. besides, they share some genetic content with high homology in several genes associated with exopolysaccharide production  and hence, with virulence, as well as in some other genes. knowledge of the content of these plasmids and comparative genetic analyses may provide interesting new clues to understanding the origin and evolution of these pathogens and the level of symptoms they produce. furthermore, genetic similarities observed among some of the plasmids (and genomes) from the above indicated pathogenic species and e. tasmaniensis or e. billingiae, which are epiphytic on the same hosts, may reveal associations that could expose the mechanisms of origin of pathogens. a summary of the current information on their  plasmids and the relationships among them is presented here.

TI  == detection of erwinia species from the apple and pear flora by mass spectroscopy of whole cells and with novel pcr primers.
AB  == aims: to detect the apple and pear pathogens erwinia amylovora and erwinia pyrifoliae as well as the related epiphytes erwinia tasmaniensis and erwinia billingiae, we created novel pcr primers and also applied them to a series of other plant-associated bacteria as control. to facilitate fast diagnosis, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). methods and results: the pcr primers were deduced from the psts-glms regions, which can include the gene for levansucrase, and also from regions encoding capsular polysaccharide synthesis. all primer combinations were  specific for their associated erwinia species to detect them with conventional pcr, also in mixed cultures from necrotic plant tissue. other primers designed for quantitative pcr with sybr green or together with taqman probes were applied  for real-time detection to determine growth of erw. amylovora, erw. billingiae, erw. pyrifoliae and erw. tasmaniensis in apple blossoms. from whole-cell protein  extracts, profiles were generated using a bruker microflex machine and erwinia strains classified according to a score scheme. conclusions: the designed pcr primers identified the erwinia species unambiguously and can be applied to qualitative and quantitative tests. maldi-tof ms data were in agreement with the  pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: the applied diagnosis methods allow fast and precise monitoring of two pathogenic and two epiphytic erwinia species. they are valuable for population studies with apple and pear flowers and with diseased plant material.

TI  == comparative genomics of erwinia amylovora and related erwinia species-what do we  learn?
AB  == erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight disease of apples and pears, is one of the most important plant bacterial pathogens with worldwide economic significance. recent reports on the complete or draft genome sequences of four species in the genus erwinia, including e. amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. tasmaniensis, and e. billingiae, have provided us near complete genetic information about this pathogen and its closely-related species. this review describes in silico subtractive hybridization-based comparative genomic analyses  of eight genomes currently available, and highlights what we have learned from these comparative analyses, as well as genetic and functional genomic studies. sequence analyses reinforce the assumption that e. amylovora is a relatively homogeneous species and support the current classification scheme of e. amylovora and its related species. the potential evolutionary origin of these erwinia species is also proposed. the current understanding of the pathogen, its virulence mechanism and host specificity from genome sequencing data is summarized. future research directions are also suggested.

TI  == genome comparison of the epiphytic bacteria erwinia billingiae and e. tasmaniensis with the pear pathogen e. pyrifoliae.
AB  == background: the genus erwinia includes plant-associated pathogenic and non-pathogenic enterobacteria. important pathogens such as erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight and e. pyrifoliae causing bacterial shoot blight of pear in asia belong to this genus. the species e. tasmaniensis and e. billingiae are epiphytic bacteria and may represent antagonists for biocontrol of fire blight. the presence of genes that are putatively involved in virulence in e. amylovora and e. pyrifoliae is of special interest for these species in consequence. results: here we provide the complete genome sequences of the pathogenic e. pyrifoliae strain ep1/96 with a size of 4.1 mb and of the non-pathogenic species e. billingiae strain eb661 with a size of 5.4 mb, de novo  determined by conventional sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing techniques. genome comparison reveals large inversions resulting from homologous  recombination events. furthermore, comparison of deduced proteins highlights a relation of e. billingiae strain eb661 to e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 and a distance to e. pyrifoliae for the overall gene content as well as for the presence of encoded proteins representing virulence factors for the pathogenic species. pathogenicity of e. pyrifoliae is supposed to have evolved by accumulation of potential virulence factors. e. pyrifoliae carries factors for type iii secretion and cell invasion. other genes described as virulence factors  for e. amylovora are involved in the production of exopolysaccharides, the utilization of plant metabolites such as sorbitol and sucrose. some virulence-associated genes of the pathogenic species are present in e. tasmaniensis but mostly absent in e. billingiae. conclusion: the data of the genome analyses correspond to the pathogenic lifestyle of e. pyrifoliae and underlines the epiphytic localization of e. tasmaniensis and e. billingiae as a saprophyte.

TI  == hypersensitive response and acyl-homoserine lactone production of the fire blight antagonists erwinia tasmaniensis and erwinia billingiae.
AB  == fire blight caused by the gram-negative bacterium erwinia amylovora can be controlled by antagonistic microorganisms. we characterized epiphytic bacteria isolated from healthy apple and pear trees in australia, named erwinia tasmaniensis, and the epiphytic bacterium erwinia billingiae from england for physiological properties, interaction with plants and interference with growth of e. amylovora. they reduced symptom formation by the fire blight pathogen on immature pears and the colonization of apple flowers. in contrast to e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis strains induced a hypersensitive response in tobacco  leaves and synthesized levan in the presence of sucrose. with consensus primers deduced from lsc as well as hrpl, hrcc and hrcr of the hrp region of e. amylovora and of related bacteria, these genes were successfully amplified from e. tasmaniensis dna and alignment of the encoded proteins to other erwinia species supported a role for environmental fitness of the epiphytic bacterium. unlike e.  tasmaniensis, the epiphytic bacterium e. billingiae produced an acyl-homoserine lactone for bacterial cell-to-cell communication. their competition with the growth of e. amylovora may be involved in controlling fire blight.

TI  == erwinia tasmaniensis sp. nov., a non-phytopathogenic bacterium from apple and pear trees.
AB  == bacteria were isolated from flowers and bark of apple and pear trees at three places in australia. in victoria, tasmania and queensland, strains with white colonies on nutrient agar were screened for dome-shaped colony morphology on agar with sucrose and were found to be closely related by several criteria. the isolates were not pathogenic on apples or pears. they were characterized by a polyphasic approach including microbiological and api assays as well as fatty acid methyl ester analysis, dna-dna hybridization and dna sequencing. for molecular classification, the 16s rrna cistron and the conserved genes gpd and reca of these bacteria were investigated. together with other taxonomic criteria, the results of these studies indicate that the bacteria belong to a novel separate species, which we propose to name erwinia tasmaniensis sp. nov., with the type strain et1/99(t) (=dsm 17950(t)=ncppb 4357(t)). from dna-dna hybridization kinetics, microbiological characteristics and nucleotide sequence analyses, this species is related to pathogenic erwinia species, but also to the  epiphytic species erwinia billingiae.
