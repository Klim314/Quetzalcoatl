TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == [etiological aspects of acute gastroenteritis--a ten-year review (1.01. 2001-31.12.2010)].
AB  == acute gastroentritis is one of the most common diseases in humans, and continues  to be a significant cause of morbidity worldwide. aims: to determine the bacterial pathogens associated with gastroenteritis in patients admitted to the iasi infectious diseases hospital in the last ten years. material and methods: a  total of 40481 stool samples were examined using conventional methods. results: bacteria were found in 7.36% of cases, and parasites in 9.64%; 83% of the cases were viral, micotic, or disbiotic. the bacterial etiology was dominated by salmonella spp. (58.34%), shigella spp. (27.08%), yersinia enterocolitica 03 (8.53%), campylobacter spp. (1.31%), other bacterial pathogens (epec, aeromonas hydrophilla/caviae/sobria, plesiomonas shigelloides, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, etc) being detected in 3.74% of the cases. of the salmonella species, group b (51.99%) followed by group d (45.23%) were most common. shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri were found in almost the same proportion (49.45% and 49.70%, respectively); shigella boydii was isolated in only 0.85% of cases. the trend of gastroenteritis caused by bacterial pathogens is decreasing: from 355 cases in 2001 to 105 cases in 2010; three peaks have been recorded in 2002, 2005 (when salmonella typhi was isolated in a patient), and 2008 (469, 409, and 252 cases, respectively). bacterial gastroenteritis affected  both sexes almost equally (122 males and 118 females). the most affected age groups were: 0 - 4 years, 15 - 24 years, 5 - 14 years and 25 - 39 years. conclusions: laboratory investigations are essential in determining the etiology  of gastroenteritis. its unpredictable incidence justifies the human and material  efforts aimed at controlling the spread of potentially epidemic acute gastroenteritis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic moringa leaf extracts.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic moringa  leaf extracts (moringa oleifera) on the growth of gram-positive and negative bacteria. methods: paper disks were soaked with 100, 200, 300 and 400 mul of extract at 20 g/180 ml and 10 g/190 ml. all extracts were tested against escherichia coli (atcc25922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc25923), vibrio parahaemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis (atcc29212), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), salmonella enteritidis (ih) and aeromonas caviae. the susceptibility tests were performed using the modified disk diffusion method. results: the strains e. coli, p. aeruginosa and s. enteritidis (ih) were resistant to all treatments. in general, disks with 400 mul extract were the most efficient against s. aureus, v. parahaemolyticus, e. faecalis and a. caviae. conclusions: the study indicates a promising potential for aqueous and ethanolic moringa leaf  extracts as alternative treatment of infections caused by the tested strains.

TI  == rabbit meat as a source of bacterial foodborne pathogens.
AB  == even though worldwide production of rabbit meat is >1,000,000 tons, little information is available for rabbit meat microbiology. this study provides data on the prevalence of salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria spp., motile aeromonas spp., and staphylococcus aureus on rabbit meat. a total of 24 rabbit carcasses from two abattoirs and 27 rabbit meat packages from supermarket displays were examined. in addition to culturing methods, associated virulence genes were investigated by pcr in suspect isolates  and samples. neither salmonella nor e. coli o157:h7 was detected. all samples were negative for virulence-associated inva, stx1, and stx2 genes. at one abattoir, two carcasses (3.9%) carried y. enterocolitica yst-, and two were positive for the yst gene, although viable y. enterocolitica cells were not recovered from these samples. seven samples (13.7%) were contaminated with listeria. of them, three were positive for hly and iap genes (listeria monocytogenes hly+ / iap+), two carried listeria seeligeri, one carried listeria  ivanovii, and one carried listeria innocua. for detectable motile aeromonas spp.  (average count, 1.77 +/- 0.62 log cfu/g), the contamination rate was 35.3%, although ca. 90% of the samples were positive for the aera and/or hlya genes. the majority of aeromonad isolates were aeromonas hydrophila aera+ / hlya+. aeromonas caviae, aeromonas popoffii, aeromonas schubertii, and the two biovars of aeromonas veronii were also isolated. the prevalence of s. aureus contamination (average count, 1.37 +/- 0.79 log cfu/g) was 52.9%. among 27 s. aureus isolates,  two harbored genes for staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), and two harbored genes for staphylococcal enterotoxin c (sec). the remaining isolates were negative for  sea, seb, sec, sed, and see.

TI  == occurrence of staphylococcus and enteropathogens in soft cheese commercialized in the city of rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == aims: to investigate the presence of staphylococcus aureus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), aeromonas spp. and yersinia spp. in soft cheese commercialized in rio de janeiro, brazil. methods and results: a total of 45 samples of cheese from three different brands marketed in rio de janeiro city were analysed for faecal coliform levels using the most probable number (mpn) technique. the samples were also analysed using conventional methodology for the  investigation of food-borne pathogens. high levels of faecal contamination were detected in 95.5% of cheese samples. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 20%  of samples, of which 17.7% were above the limits allowed by brazilian legislation. aeromonas hydrophila and aer. caviae were detected in 17.7% of the samples. yersinia spp. were not found in this study. epec was isolated from 21.1% of the samples and the most frequently found serogroups were o127, followed by o55 and o26. conclusions: our results showed that 95.5% of cheese samples had high levels of faecal coliforms. the isolation of staph. aureus, serogroups of epec and aeromonas spp. suggested that the soft cheese commercialized in the city of rio de janeiro may represent a health risk for the consumers. significance and impact of the study: these results suggest that soft cheese may act as an important vehicle of transmission for well-established pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of the synergistic haemolysis (camp-like) test in the identification of motile, mesophilic aeromonas species.
AB  == usefulness of the synergistic haemolysis (camp-like) test in the identification of aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria, and aeromonas caviae was evaluated, using beta-toxin producing staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and alpha-toxin producing clostridium perfringens atcc 13124 as sphingomyelinase producing indicator strains. the tests were done on columbia blood agar base supplemented with 5% sheep blood (cba; difco laboratories, detroit, mi, usa). when cultured aerobically, 77% of a. hydrophila isolates, 75% of a. sobria isolates, and 23% of a. caviae isolates elicited synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes with the beta-toxin producing strain of s. aureus. anaerobically, using the same indicator strain, synergistic haemolysis was given by 91%, 51% and 82% of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae, respectively. when alpha-toxin producing c. perfringens was used in the test instead of beta-toxin producing s. aureus, 100%, 86%, and 93% of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae isolates, respectively, showed synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. due to the high number of the tested isolates of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae giving a positive synergistic haemolysis reaction in both atmospheric conditions of culture, this test cannot be used to identify any of the three aeromonas spp. the use of alpha-toxin producing c. perfringens did not improve discriminatory power of the  test. because the nature of the product of aeromonas spp. responsible for the lytic phenomenon is not known, the use of aeromonas factor and synergistic haemolysis terms was proposed rather than camp (reaction, test) or camp (-like) factor.
