TI  == new bacterial composition in primary and persistent/secondary endodontic infections with respect to clinical and radiographic findings.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to analyze the microbiota of primary and secondary/persistent endodontic infections of patients undergoing endodontic treatment with respect to clinical and radiographic findings. methods: samples from the root canals of 21 german patients were taken using 3 sequential  sterile paper points. in the case of a root canal filling, gutta-percha was removed with sterile files, and samples were taken using sterile paper points. the samples were plated, and microorganisms were then isolated and identified morphologically by biochemical analysis and sequencing the 16s rrna genes of isolated microorganisms. results: in 12 of 21 root canals, 33 different species could be isolated. six (50%) of the cases with isolated microorganisms were primary, and 6 (50%) cases were endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth. twelve of the isolated species were facultative anaerobic and 21 obligate  anaerobic. monomicrobial infections were found for enterococcus faecalis and actinomyces viscosus. e. faecalis was most frequently isolated in secondary endodontic infections (33%). moraxella osloensis was isolated from a secondary endodontic infection that had an insufficient root canal filling accompanied by a mild sensation of pain. a new bacterial composition compromising atopobium rimae, anaerococcus prevotii, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, dialister invisus, and fusobacterium nucleatum was recovered from teeth with chronic apical abscesses. conclusions: new bacterial combinations were found and correlated to clinical and radiographic findings, particularly to chronic apical abscesses. m. osloensis was detected in root canals for the second time and only in german patients.

TI  == microbial diversity in failed endodontic root-filled teeth.
AB  == background: persistent/secondary infections of human root canals play an important role in the failure of endodontic treatment. this study used 16s rrna sequencing to assess microbial diversity in root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. methods: dna was extracted from 15 teeth with persistent intraradicular infections, and the 16s rrna of all present bacteria were amplified by pcr, followed by cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna amplicons. results: all sample extracts were positive for pcr amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers. negative control reactions yielded no amplicons. sixty-five phylotypes belonging to seven phyla were identified from 760 clones; a mean of 9.4 phylotypes were detected in each sample (range 3 - 15). twenty-eight phylotypes were detected in more than one sample, revealing a high inter-sample variability. parvimonas micra (60%, 9/15), solobacterium moore (47%, 7/15), dialister invisus (33%, 5/15), enterococcus faecalis (33%, 5/15), filifactor alocis (27%, 4/15), and fusobacterium nucleatum (27%, 4/15) were the prevalent species. nineteen as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were identified, comprising a substantial proportion of the bacteria in many cases. conclusions: persistent intraradicular infections were present in all root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. the current observations reveal new  candidate endodontic pathogens, including as-yet-uncultivated bacteria and phylotypes that may participate in the mixed infections associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == new bacterial compositions in root-filled teeth with periradicular lesions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and detect microorganisms of root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions. specimens were sampled from patients undergoing root canal retreatment. the bacteria were characterized by morphologic and biochemical analysis and by 16s rrna gene sequencing. microorganisms were detected in 10 of 18 teeth. the majority of positive samples revealed a mixed culture of 2-8 species. in 2 teeth enterococcus faecalis was the only detected species. for the first time vagococcus fluvialis was detected in root canals. solobacterium moorei and fusobacterium nucleatum were the most prevalent species. presence of f. nucleatum was associated with the presence of s. moorei in 5 of 7  cases. in all teeth with parvimonas micra and dialister invisus, f. nucleatum and s. moorei were found. moreover, members of additional different genera were detected delivering bacterial compositions that have been not described yet.

TI  == microorganisms in root canal-treated teeth from a german population.
AB  == posttreatment apical periodontitis is usually associated with persistent or secondary intraradicular infection. this study evaluated the presence and relative levels of 28 bacterial taxa in treated root canals of teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis from german patients using 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene probes in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was also performed to detect enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. bacterial dna was detected in all samples. twenty of the 28 taxon-specific probes tested were reactive with at least one sample. taxa detected more frequently included streptococcus species (47%), lactobacillus species (35%), dialister invisus (29%), eubacterium infirmum (29%), prevotella intermedia (29%), selenomonas sputigena (29%), synergistes oral clone ba121 (29%), and treponema denticola (29%). only eight taxa were present at levels >10(5). of these, streptococci and t. denticola were the most prevalent. species-specific pcr detected e. faecalis in 47% of the cases and c. albicans in  6%. findings of this study confirm the strong association between persistent/secondary intraradicular infection and posttreatment apical periodontitis. most cases harbored a mixed infection, and e. faecalis, if present, was never the most dominant species in the consortium. several other bacterial taxa were detected, and an involvement with the etiology of posttreatment apical periodontitis is suspected.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
