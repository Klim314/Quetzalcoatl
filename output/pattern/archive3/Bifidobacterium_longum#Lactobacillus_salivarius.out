comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%) and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l. reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.
purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
