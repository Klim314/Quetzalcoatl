TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.
TI  - Methods for optimizing DNA extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time PCR.
AB  - Methods for the optimal extraction of genomic DNA for real-time PCR enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, Parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of DNA content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time PCR approach. Evidence was obtained that P. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded DNA from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. This nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol at 4 degrees C overnight. A final purification of the DNA to remove any potential PCR inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of DNA by real-time PCR and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - [Preparation and antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium salt monomers].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prepare three quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) monomers, and to compare their antibacterial activities against four oral bacterial strains. METHODS: Three antibacterial monomers [methacryloxyethyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-BC), methacryloxyethyl m-chloro benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-m-CBC), methacryloxyethyl cetyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-CB)] were synthesized according to the general structure of target monomers. Their antibacterial effects were investigated using the broth dilution test on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica ). RESULTS: Three different monomers were successfully obtained. All the tested bacterial strains were susceptible to the three monomers, among which DMAE-CB exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: All these three QAS monomers have different antibacterial activities against four oral bacteria strains. The data indicate that DMAE-CB may be a candidate antibacterial agent for oral infectious diseases.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  - Dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. Bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. Recent literature has demonstrated that infrared CO(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. In this study, a XeCl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (Summit Technology, Boston, USA). Both aerobe (Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii) and anaerobe microorganisms (A. odontolyticus, Prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. According to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 J/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 Hz were used for all irradiations. Colony-forming units after laser irradiation were counted. Excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. As compared to S. mutans and S. sanguis, A. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. Anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. Excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. Depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. New studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other wavelengths or conventional therapies.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal microleakage of AH26 and AH Plus root canal sealers.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the penetration of Candida albicans alone and a combination of bacteria through root canals filled with gutta-percha and one or other root canal sealers, AH26 and AH Plus. METHODOLOGY: Eighty teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 40 teeth each and obturated with gutta-percha using either AH26 or AH Plus sealer. A further 10 teeth served as negative controls and 10 as positive controls. The external surface of each root, except the apical 2 mm, was covered with two layers of nail varnish. The teeth were inserted into Eppendorf plastic tubes and suspended in glass bottles containing sterile Schaedler broth. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus acidophilus were placed in the access cavities of 20 teeth filled with AH26 and 20 with AH Plus. Candida albicans was placed in the access cavities of the other teeth. The culture medium with microorganisms was changed every 7 days. Every 72 h bacterial or fungal growth in the broth was tested up to a period of 90 days. RESULTS: Leakage in the experimental teeth occurred between 14 and 87 days. Leakage was present in 47% of all samples. From the samples with AH26, 45% leaked bacteria and 60% leaked fungi; whilst from the samples with AH Plus, 50% leaked bacteria and 55% fungi. There was no statistically significant difference in penetration of bacteria and fungi between the sealers. CONCLUSION: In this in vitro study, gutta-percha and the sealers AH26 and AH Plus allowed leakage of bacteria and fungi.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Detection of dextranase-producing gram-negative oral bacteria.
AB  - Thirty-one strains of 23 gram-negative oral bacterial species were examined for dextran-degrading activity on agar plates containing blue dextran. One strain each of Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis had detectable dextranase activity. The culture supernatants of P. melaninogenica and P. oralis cells contained dextranases of multiple sizes, but those of the other three species had a single size of enzyme. A 56-kDa dextranase was purified from the culture supernatant of P. oralis and the antiserum against the enzyme was prepared with a rabbit. The Ouchterlony test showed that the antibody reacted with the supernatants of both P. melaninogenica and P. oralis but not with the others. Dot-blot hybridization using the dextranase gene of Streptococcus mutans as a probe revealed that there was no significantly homologous sequence in the chromosomal DNA of the five species.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Plaque pH and microflora of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces.
AB  - Given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced pH response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. Seventeen caries-active elderly Chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. Plaque pH was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. Plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious pH-measurement sites in each subject. The prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on Brucella agar: Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, Streptococcus spp., S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. There was no difference in plaque pH response on sound and carious root surfaces. The plaque pH response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites. There was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. The pH response to sucrose was the same regardless of the presence or absence of mutans streptococci. Our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.
TI  - [Antimicrobial properties of Flos Lonicerae against oral pathogens].
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of Flos Lonicerae on oral pathogens was studied. The results showed that 73.9% of the tested pathogens were inhibited at a concentration below 6.25mg/ml. Streptococci mutants, actinomyces viscosus and bacteroides melaninogenicus were comparatively more sensitive to Flos Lonicerae.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The antibacterial effect of toothpastes on the salivary flora.
AB  - Both past and presently available toothpastes contain potential antimicrobial agents which could have a beneficial effect in the prevention of plaque and gingivitis. If these preparations were to be effective clinically, some effect on salivary bacteria would also be expected. This cross-over study measured salivary bacterial counts and the presence or absence of residual antibacterial activity in saliva following tooth brushing with 7 commercially available toothpastes, and moreover, compared their effect with that produced by a chlorhexidine gel. Generally, all toothpaste products produced a reduction in aerobic, anaerobic and streptococcal counts with a hexetidine containing toothpaste producing the largest and longest lasting reduction. In contrast, an enzyme containing toothpaste and an amine fluoride toothpaste, had little effect on bacterial counts. The chlorhexidine gel produced the largest reduction in salivary counts, which was evident for at least 5 h following brushing. Residual antibacterial activity in saliva was only evident immediately following brushing with the hexetidine toothpaste, but for the chlorhexidine gel, was present up to 90 min following brushing. The findings of this study have illustrated the limited antibacterial activity of presently available toothpastes on the salivary flora compared to chlorhexidine, and as such, would tend to question the relative benefit of toothpaste in preventing periodontal disease through an antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological aspects of chemotherapeutic agents used according to the specific plaque hypothesis.
AB  - Certain forms of dental decay and periodontal disease appear to be due to specific bacterial infections following overgrowth of certain indigenous plaque bacteria, i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis, If so, then antimicrobial treatment based on a diagnosis of elevated levels or proportions of these organisms should be considered. Such treatment cannot be administered according to concepts of the non-specific plaque hypothesis. A treatment philosophy is presented which is based upon considerations long established in medical infections following overgrowth of certain indigenous plaque bacteria, i.e., the specific plaque hypomicrobial to the site of the infection for periods long enough to suppress or destroy the pathogenic agent. Examples of this treatment philosophy are given.

TI  - International aspects of oral microbiology.
AB  - It appears that the bacteria of the mouth are remarkably similar throughout the world. There are differences, but they are mostly of a quantitative rather than a qualitative nature. Although much is yet to be learned on the regulation of the oral ecosystems, these quantitative fluctuations to a large extent seem to be induced by different dietary patterns: the food exerting a strong selective pressure on the oral microbiota.
