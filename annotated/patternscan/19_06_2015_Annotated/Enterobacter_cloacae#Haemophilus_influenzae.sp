TI  == pcr detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  == background: bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. aim: the aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of  endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on pcr. materials and methods: vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. total vitreous dna was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified from genomic dna using pcr with a pair of had2 universal primers. library of pcr  products from 16s rrna, cloned into the ptz57r/t vector. the ligated products were then transformed into e. coli dh5alpha strain and grown in the lb-ampicillin/x-gal/iptg plate. results: from the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). twelve species including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, chlamydia trachomatis, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria meningitides, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus were identified using blast for known 16s rrna sequences. conclusion: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. the rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.

TI  == discrepancy in maldi-tof ms identification of uncommon gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == introduction: early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. the objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with cf. methods: a total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with cf representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using maldi-tof ms in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. discrepancies were confirmed by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing in five  gram-negative isolates. results: the maldi-tof ms managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. the maldi-tof ms results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, achromobacter xylosoxidans, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as chryseobacterium gleum and enterobacter cloacae. the 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all gram-negative bacteria. the isolation of e. cloacae and haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with cf. conclusion: although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with cf, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon gram-negative bacteria may exist.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == the unique structure of haemophilus influenzae protein e reveals multiple binding sites for host factors.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae protein e (pe) is a multifunctional adhesin involved in direct interactions with lung epithelial cells and host proteins, including plasminogen and the extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin and laminin. we recently crystallized pe and successfully collected x-ray diffraction data at 1.8 a. here, we solved the structure of a recombinant version of pe and analyzed different functional regions. it is a dimer in solution and in the asymmetric unit of the crystals. the dimer has a structure that resembles a flattened beta-barrel. it is, however, not a true beta-barrel, as there are differences in  both the hydrogen-bonding pattern and the shape. each monomer consisted of a 6-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with a rigid alpha-helix at the c terminus tethered to the concave side of the sheet by a disulfide bridge. the laminin/plasminogen binding region (residues 41 to 68) is exposed, while the vitronectin binding region (residues 84 to 108) is partially accessible in the dimer. the dimerized pe explains the simultaneous interaction with laminin and vitronectin. in addition, we found this unique adhesin to be present in many bacterial genera of the family pasteurellaceae and also orthologues in other, unrelated species (enterobacter cloacae and listeria monocytogenes). peptides corresponding to the surface-exposed regions pe 24 to 37, pe 74 to 89, and pe 134 to 156 were immunogenic in the mouse. importantly, these peptide-based antibodies also recognized pe at the bacterial surface. taken together, our detailed structure of pe explains how this important virulence factor of h. influenzae simultaneously interacts with host vitronectin, laminin, or plasminogen, promoting bacterial pathogenesis.

TI  == efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia based on pharmacokinetic analysis.
AB  == moxifloxacin is a respiratory quinolone that is expected to be useful for treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, but few clinical studies and not a detailed evaluation of its pharmacokinetics have been conducted in japan in patients with pneumonia. we assessed the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in 18 patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis. there was significant improvement in body temperature, white blood cell count, c-reactive protein, and chest x-ray score on day 3 of moxifloxacin treatment, which persisted until the completion of treatment (all p < 0.05). nine strains, including streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and enterobacter cloacae, were isolated from sputum cultures of nine patients. the isolated strains were eradicated by moxifloxacin. the mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [auc(0-24 h) (auc(0-24 h,ss))], maximum plasma concentration (c(max)), and trough plasma level (c(trough)) of moxifloxacin at steady state was 52.0 mug h/ml, 4.5, and 0.9 mug/ml, respectively. mean auc(0-24 h,ss)/mimimum inhibitory concentration (mic), and c(max)/mic ratios for patients in whom mics of moxifloxacin were determined for pathogenic bacteria were 723 and 62, respectively. the median auc(0-24 h,ss)/mic and c(max)/mic ratios (based on monte carlo simulation employing mics for 257 strains of s. pneumoniae collected during a respiratory infection survey by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007) were 209.56 and 17.88, respectively. thus, when the target for the auc/mic ratio  was set at >/=30 and that for the c(max)/mic ratio at >/=5, the achievement rate  for these two parameters was 97.36% and 96.71%, respectively. two patients (11%)  experienced three adverse effects [one nausea, another increased aspartate aminotransferase (ast) and alanine aminotransferase (alt)], but the events were not serious. based on these results, moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) was considered useful for treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and is expected to show excellent efficacy and safety as well as suppressing the emergence of resistance.

TI  == [comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  == objective: this research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. methods: 241 cap and 116 hap with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from january to december in 2008 in children's hospital affiliated to suzhou university were selected in this study. the bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by k-b method. the chi-square or fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. results: in 241 cap, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 hap, enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). in addition, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however,  its detection rate was 66.7% in hap. the drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in  hap than that in cap for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). klebsiella  pneumoniae isolated from hap had higher drug resistance than that isolated from cap against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), smz +  tmp (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). we also found enterobacter cloacae isolated from hap showed high drug resistance  than that isolated from cap against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and pseudomonas aeruginosa from hap had higher resistance than that from cap against  gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). the detection rates of esbls for escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in cap and hap, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, p > 0.05); while for klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, p > 0.05). conclusion: cap was mainly comprised of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while hap was mainly comprised of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters. the drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in hap than that in cap.

TI  == comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four north european countries.
AB  == background: this study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (pccs), general hospital wards (ghws) and intensive care units (icus) in denmark (n = 9), finland (n = 10), norway (n = 7) and sweden (n = 19). methods: the hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive gram-positive  and 30 gram-negative clinical isolates. supportive information accompanying each  isolate included the study centre, ward level (pcc, ghw, or icu), patient identification and source of the isolate. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the etest. results:  the isolates collected comprised 1610 gram-negative and 1767 gram-positive clinical isolates. the study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (i) and resistant (r)) to tigecycline: <1% in escherichia coli, though other enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and serratia spp. (23%)). the overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding serratia spp.). the activity of tigecycline against haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. was high with a mic(50) of  0.25 mg/l and mic(90) of 1 mg/l. the prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among gram-positive bacteria was <1%. the corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. the activity of tigecycline against streptococcus pneumoniae was high with mic(50) and mic(90) of 0.125 mg/l. conclusion: tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli was i (6%), rather than r (<1%). this indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli.

TI  == comparative ceftaroline activity tested against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  == objectives: to document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the usa and europe during 2008-09.  methods: a selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (cap; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using clsi broth microdilution methods. organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the usa and 28 (12 countries) in europe. ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of mic endpoints made by applying current clsi (2010) and eucast (2010) breakpoint criteria. results: against 1340 streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/l (mic(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/l) and was 8-fold more  active than ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 mg/l; only 79.2% coverage at eucast breakpoint). haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; mic(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; mic(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/l) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; mic(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/l) were very susceptible to  ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (mdr) patterns. the potency of ceftaroline against three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/l) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative enterobacteriaceae strains between the usa and europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for e. coli). ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant e. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/l) or k. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). conclusions: the ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (usa and europe) documented low mic(50/90) values for s. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/l, respectively. more importantly, ceftaroline mic(90) results for  s. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/l), h. influenzae (0.015 mg/l) and m. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/l) were very low, all mics being </=0.5 mg/l. ceftaroline exhibited promising  high potency and wide coverage against gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause cap, especially isolates of mdr pneumococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == [bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. the objective of this study was to explore application of the combined  detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. methods: totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. the age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by  streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. the aspirate samples were also amplified for dna of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (tem-pcr) and detected with luminex xmap technology platform. results: the total positive rate  by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were hemophilus  influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187)  were acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. the total positive rate by combined detection of culture and tem-pcr assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. conclusion: the tem-pcr assay may increase the detection rate of hemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. the tem-pcr needs further improvement for diagnosis of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the mepm-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in providencia spp. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by u.s. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  == background: bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (cns) pathogens is important to define current prevalence  of resistance. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from cns specimens was analyzed using the surveillance database (tsn) usa database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 us hospital laboratories. a total of 6029 organisms derived from cns specimen sources during  2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. results: staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. the modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. prevalence of mrsa among s. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for s. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for s. agalactiae. for csf isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was s. pneumoniae (3.5%), e. coli (0.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), serratia marcescens (5.6%), enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), haemophilus influenzae (0%). listeria monocytogenes and n. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. conclusions: resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. this data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat cns infections.

AB  == background: no published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. methods: eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression  analysis using adapt ii (biomedical simulations resource, university of southern  california, los angeles, ca). ratios of maximum serum concentration (c(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) data from published studies. results: all subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and c(max) were 37.0 ml/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 ml/min), 103.3 l (range, 39.8 to 139.3 l), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/ml (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/ml), respectively. median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 ml/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 ml/min)  and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. median c(max)-mic90 ratios were  10 or greater for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the administration of levofloxacin to patients with esrd as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every  48 hours, will provide adequate c(max)-mic ratios after the first and subsequent  doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin mics of 1 microg/ml or less.

TI  == [surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
AB  == objective: to determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (hai) or community acquired infections (cai) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in china. methods: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. according to the criteria of guidelines of nccls (2001), mic(50) and mic(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and r%, i%, and s%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. results: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens  were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both cai and hai patients.  the resistance rates of isolates, especially enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp.  and acinetobacter spp. from hai were higher than those of cai. the carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against enterobacteriaceae. cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most  of gram-negative bacilli. most of the gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible  rates to fluoroquinolones of pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae had decreased. conclusion: (1) the results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some gram-negative pathogens. (2) the resistance rates of isolates from hai patients were higher than those of cai.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90  = 1 mg/l), followed by trovafloxacin (mic90 = 4 mg/l). trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against streptococcus pyogenes (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l) and staphylococcus aureus (mic90 = 0.06 mg/l) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, for which the mic90 was 8 mg/l). trovafloxacin was the most active compound against enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l. there was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was investigated in the 5 university hospitals of switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. a total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution  according to nccls. cefpirome showed an excellent activity against all enterobacteriaceae (mic90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 1 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.25 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l) isolates. its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii isolates (mic90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for cefpirome). the mics of cefpirome of 3 strains of klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (mic90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (mics90 > 32 mg/l). against pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome was as active as ceftazidime. the activity of cefpirome was poor against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and nosocomial gram-negative bacteria such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == [pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  == isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (vc), forced expiratory volume (fev1.0), pao2 and paco2. vc of the patients from whom mssa (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus) or enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), branhamella catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) or haemophilus influenza (h. influenza)  were isolated. fev1.0 had a similar tendency as vc in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. similarly, po2 of the patients from whom mssa or e. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated, and pco2  of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza were isolated. there was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom  mssa, escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), xanthomonas maltophilia (x. maltophilia) or enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom s. pneumonia, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated. these results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza to mssa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, x. maltophilia or e. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. the treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

AB  == bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (bmt) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous bmt recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (p = 0.03). bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. during the first 100 days after bmt, hospital-acquired gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter lwoffi, and enterobacter cloacae. after day +100, community-acquired, gram-positive bacteria  predominated, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae. haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (vod) (p < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) (p < 0.02). for culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and vod was significant (p  < 0.001) and borderline for acute gvhd (p = 0.07). it is concluded that vod and gvhd are positively associated with post-bmt bacterial pneumonia. its incidence,  etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == ceftibuten: a review of antimicrobial activity, spectrum and other microbiologic  features.
AB  == ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated gram-negative pathogens. more than 90% of recent enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. in only five enteric species (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. enteritis-producing bacteria such as  salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli and yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (mic50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). fastidious gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten mics, including beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas species and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. the microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == bacterial resistance to carbapenems.
AB  == the carbapenems have the broadest spectra of all beta-lactams but resistance still occurs, caused by target modification, impermeability or beta-lactamase production. target modification or replacement is important in methicillin-resistant staphylococci, e. faecium and some pneumococci. these organisms present the greatest current threat to carbapenem efficacy. impermeability to carbapenems arises in p. aeruginosa mutants, where it is contingent on loss of d2 outer membrane protein, a minor porin. this resistance functions only if the pseudomonas retains its chromosomal group 1 beta-lactamase, and so reflects the interplay of impermeability and hydrolysis rather than impermeability alone; nevertheless porin loss is the critical change that engenders resistance. resistance based on impermeability coupled to a group 1 beta-lactamase has also been described in e. cloacae, but demands loss of a major porin and is much rarer and less stable than in p. aeruginosa. although group 1 beta-lactamases contribute to resistance in these organisms, they have only feeble carbapenemase activity. chromosomal beta-lactamases with potent carbapenemase activity occur in most or all x. maltophilia, a. hydrophila and f.  odoratum isolates. these enzymes, which cause carbapenem resistance when expressed copiously, are all zinc-dependent. zinc carbapenemases also are a concern in b. fragilis, where they are encoded by the chromosomal dna of c. 3% of isolates, though expressed by only 1%. carbapenemases are extremely rare outside  these species. nevertheless, a plasmidic zinc carbapenemase was reported from one p. aeruginosa isolate and from several s. marcescens. further carbapenemases, some not zinc-dependent, are known from a tiny numbers of serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter isolates. despite these various modes of resistance, carbapenems have retained their efficacy far better than have expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. whether this advantage will be retained indefinitely is uncertain. if resistance does become more prevalent it may be possible to derivatize the carbapenems so as to extend their activity. there is already interest in the design of carbapenems that bind beta-lactam-resistant pbps and, to an extent, in the development of carbapenemase inhibitors.

AB  == the synthesis and microbiological evaluation of a new series of 3-thiazol-4-yl-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins is described. structure activity relationship was achieved by changing substitution at the 2-position of the thiazole moiety. the result was a marked variance of microbiological activity in  the c7 side-chain derivatives. atmo derivatives possess potent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. for example, mics (microgram/ml) of ly215226 against representative organisms are as follows: s. aureus 0.25, s. pneumoniae 0.008, h. influenzae 0.008, e. coli 0.25, k. pneumoniae 0.008, e. cloacae 0.5, s. typhi 0.25, and m. morganii 0.25.

TI  == cefquinome (hr 111v). in vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
AB  == cefquinome (formerly hr 111v), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest mic (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and providencia stuartii strains. a total of 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by  cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome activity of particular note for  gram-positive isolates included corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (mic50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than  oxacillin-susceptible (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus species (mic90, <  or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). when tested against organisms possessing bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (mic, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. this compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during march through april 1985, 1988 and 1992)  to penicillin v, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by mic determination on pdm and pdm ii agar. the mics of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined  against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and bay y 3118. beta-lactamase production was found in  10% of h. influenzae and 80-90% of s. aureus and b. catarrhalis in 1992. among h. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. decreased susceptibility of s. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. decreased susceptibility of s. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. the two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and bay  y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. the study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.

TI  == low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  == since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. we evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (uti) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (s/sti) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either uti or lrti (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned uti and lrti groups. amongst the pathogens isolated (36 gram-positive, 150 gram-negative), the most predominant species were escherichia coli in uti and bacteraemia (n = 81), streptococcus pneumoniae in lrti and bacteraemia (n = 23),  haemophilus influenzae in lrti (n = 16), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in s/sti. the mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial uti, lrti and s/sti, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. the bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species  of aerobic gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in  hospitalized patients.

TI  == ampg, a signal transducer in chromosomal beta-lactamase induction.
AB  == the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase in citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae is inducible by beta-lactam antibiotics. when an inducible ampc gene is introduced on a plasmid into escherichia coli together with its transcriptional regulator ampr, the plasmid-borne beta-lactamase is still inducible. we have isolated mutants, containing alterations in a novel e. coli gene, ampg, in which  a cloned c. freundii ampc gene is unable to respond to beta-lactam inducers. the  ampg gene was cloned, sequenced and mapped to minute 9.6 on the e. coli chromosome. the deduced amino acid sequence predicted ampg to be a 53 kda, transmembrane protein, which we propose acts as a signal transducer or permease in the beta-lactamase induction system. immediately upstream of ampg there is another 579-base-pair-long open reading frame (orf) encoding a putative lipoprotein shown to be non-essential for beta-lactamase induction. we have found that ampg and this orf form an operon, whose promoter is located in front of the  orf. located closely upstream of the putative promoter is the morphogene bola, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation. however, using transcription fusions, we have found that the ampg transcription is not regulated by bola. in addition, we show that transcription is probably not regulated by either the starvation specific sigma factor rpos, which controls bola, or by ampd the negative regulator for ampc transcription.

TI  == single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of ha-1a, a human igm anti-lipid-a monoclonal antibody, in pediatric patients with sepsis syndrome.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and safety of ha-1a (nebacumab), a human igm monoclonal antibody with specificity for the lipid a region of endotoxin, were evaluated in  a multicenter trial of pediatric patients with sepsis syndrome or septic shock. forty-two patients received a total of 44 infusions of drug, at a dose of 3 mg/kg (maximum 100 mg). the mean age was 7 years 10 months (range, 11 months to 16 years 7 months). the pharmacokinetic behavior of ha-1a during 36 hours was best described by a one-compartment open model. clearance (6.1 +/- 2.0 ml/kg per hour) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (0.11 +/- 0.03 l/kg) were larger than values reported previously in adults with sepsis syndrome. elimination half-life (14.5 +/- 6.8 hours) and plasma concentration after infusion (30.7 +/- 14.5 mg/l) were similar to adults' values. in an additional three patients studied for 72 hours after administration, a biexponential function (i.e., two-compartment open model) best described the pharmacokinetic behavior of ha-1a: clearance (1.5 +/- 1.4 ml/hr per kilogram) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (0.2 +/- 0.02 l/kg) were different (p < 0.002) from values observed in children's blood samples during 36 hours. within the pediatric population, no age-related differences in pharmacokinetics could be detected. drug disposition was unaffected by renal or hepatic dysfunction. decreased blood pressure was the most frequently reported adverse event; 4 (9%) episodes in 44 infusions were considered possibly related to the study drug. gram-negative bacteremia was documented in 23 (55%) of 42 patients. the overall mortality rate was 31%. enterobacter cloacae was the most common pathogen isolated. haemophilus influenzae type b was isolated from one child with sepsis syndrome. we conclude that infusion of ha-1a in children is associated with a low incidence of side effects. the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic behavior of ha-1a  in children requires further study to determine whether developmental differences exist and how these differences might affect drug administration. efficacy remains to be studied.

TI  == decimal assay for additivity of drugs permits delineation of synergy and antagonism.
AB  == although there are many in vitro tests for drug interactions, few possess a linear, predictable dose-dependent end point or have a precise definition for additivity. therefore, a new test with both of these features, the decimal assay  for additivity, was developed. this test is based on a disk diffusion assay and the strict linear relationship between drug mass and size of the inhibition zone. when the decimal assay for additivity was applied to combinations known on a mechanistic basis to be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, results of the new test always reflected the expected drug interaction. for example, synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was detected in tests with escherichia  coli and haemophilus influenzae, as was antagonism between cefoxitin and cefotaxime in tests with enterobacter cloacae. quinolones plus chloramphenicol appeared to be antagonistic. in addition to correctly identifying the drug interaction, the decimal assay for additivity identified the drug ratio producing the maximal drug interaction. these results suggest that the decimal assay for additivity should prove very useful in future studies of drug interactions.

TI  == determinants of the activity of beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
AB  == inhibitor combinations provide one strategy to overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance. their success depends, obviously, on the inhibitor being able to bind and inactivate the beta-lactamase molecules. clavulanate, sulbactam and tazobactam are irreversible inactivators of many beta-lactamases, forming covalent complexes which resist hydrolysis. 'suicide' kinetics are seen with some, but not all, enzymes. all three compounds inactivate staphylococcal penicillinase, the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and bacteroides spp., and the class iv beta-lactamases present in some klebsiellae. tazobactam, but not the other compounds, has moderate activity against some class i (ampc) chromosomal beta-lactamases, notably that of morganella morganii, but not that of enterobacter cloacae. both clavulanate and tazobactam are strong inhibitors of the widely distributed tem and shv plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases; sulbactam is a weaker inhibitor. other factors, aside from the affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme, co-determine the success or failure of  inhibition. potentiation is most readily achieved if little enzyme is produced, and if the organism is very permeable to the inhibitor. thus, resistance to inhibitor combinations is rare in strains of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae that produce tem-beta-lactamase, but is commoner in enterobacteria that produce this enzyme, since these are less permeable and sometimes manufacture very large amounts of enzyme. the partner beta-lactam agent is also important. irrespective of the inhibitor used, piperacillin is easier to protect  against tem beta-lactamases and the m. morganii class i enzyme than are ampicillin, amoxycillin or ticarcillin. this may relate to the lower affinity of  piperacillin for these enzymes, or to its greater affinity for the bacterial penicillin-binding proteins. finally, ph can affect the degree of inhibition achieved with sulphones for some beta-lactamases, notably tem-1.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of sce-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == sce-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and e1040. against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, sce-2787 was more active than ceftazidime  and e1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. sce-2787 was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the mic90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. sce-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, although its mic90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. the activities of sce-2787 against streptococcus species, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. furthermore, mic90s of sce-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates  of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae. sce-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with km or ki values of greater than 100 microm. the in vitro activity of sce-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. thus, sce-2787 appears to be a promising  cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

AB  == 35 survivors of acute bacterial meningitis (abm) from a group of 44 sudanese children--seen during 18 months (april 1985-november 1986)--were prospectively followed to ascertain the long-term sequelae of the disease. 30 (17 with haemophilus influenzae, 8 neisseria meningitidis, 4 streptococcus pneumoniae and  one child with enterobacter cloacae meningitis) could be followed during the surveillance period (3-4 years). three (10%), including 2 with hemiplegia, died after 11-12 months. the association between motor deficit on discharge from hospital and subsequent death was significant (p = 0.04). of the remaining 27, neuropsychologic sequelae were recorded in 9 (33%). sensorineural hearing loss was observed in 6 (22%) patients and improved in one during surveillance. motor deficits were found to improve with time but were replaced by the development of  epilepsy about 3 years later in 11% of the survivors. the mean iq (+/- sd) score  for a subgroup of 19 post-meningitic children (92.3 +/- 13.9) was found to be significantly lower than in their nearest-age sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2; p = less than 0.01). younger age at admission and longer duration of abm symptoms before treatment were significantly associated with poorer outcome (respectively, r = 0.63, p = less than 0.01, r = 0.67, p = less than 0.01). the potential impact of vaccination against the commonest organisms causing abm in developing countries is discussed.

AB  == the stability of the 1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporin framework has allowed the synthesis of a range of 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems unavailable for a variety of reasons in the cephem arena. the known p-nitrobenzyl 7 beta-(phenoxyacetamido)-3-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy]-1-carba -1- dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxylate served as a precursor to this series of compounds.  displacement of the enol triflate with various sulfinates in acetonitrile or dmf  and deprotection of the intermediates led to 7 beta-[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]- 3-[alkyl(aryl)sulfonyl]-1-carba-1-dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxyl ic acids. the 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems display potent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the following mic's (microgram/ml) for  the 3-cyclopropyl sulfone are representative: staphylococcus aureus = 4, streptococcus pyogenes = 1, haemophilus influenzae = 0.25, escherichia coli = 0.03, enterobacter cloacae = 0.25, proteus rettgeri = 0.25. the excellent in vitro antibacterial activity of this series indicates the potential of the carbacephalosporin framework for exploring substituents which are unknown or which produce unstable cephems.

TI  == enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  == enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. the mbcs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the mics, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. no single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. in systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against  one strain each of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia rettgeri and ps. aeruginosa, and two staphylococcus aureus strains. single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.

TI  == comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all  isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. with regard to ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus ssp. isolates. all beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem or oxa enzymes. resistance to both agents was observed in enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class i enzyme from enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. however, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and  cefetamet by a class iiia enzyme form proteus vulgaris was marginal. in methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142, an iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin containing a methyl pyrrolidinio c-3 was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and tobramycin against various bacteria. bmy 28142 was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae inhibiting  90% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. the in-vitro activity of bmy 28142 was equal to or superior to cefotaxime against the highly susceptible members of the enterobacteriaceae and several-fold superior to ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 inhibited many enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam. bmy 28142 was more active than imipenem against proteus, providencia and morganella species. ceftazidime and imipenem were more active than bmy 28142 against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it inhibited piperacillin and tobramycin-resistant isolates. bmy  28142 inhibited beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. bmy 28142 was more active than ceftazidime against streptococcal and staphylococcal species, but it did not inhibit or kill most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. bmy 28142 did not inhibit most bacteroides species. bmy 28142 was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it bound poorly to enterobacter beta-lactamase, was a poor inhibitor of the tem plasmid beta-lactamase and was a poor inducer of beta-lactamases.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == the activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefotetan compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefotetan was assessed against beta-lactamase producing  clinical isolates. the majority of enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml with 50% of isolates inhibited by less than or equal  to 1 microgram/ml. cefotetan inhibited organisms resistant to cefazolin, cefonicid and cefoperazone, but not isolates of enterobacter, citrobacter or serratia resistant to ceftizoxime. cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, but it did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was as active as cefoxitin against anaerobic species such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium. cefotetan was not hydrolyzed by richmond-sykes plasmid beta-lactamases of type iii such as tem and shv, nor by the oxa or pse beta-lactamases. it also was not hydrolyzed by cephalosporinases of richmond-sykes type ia or id. cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamases of the type  ia and id, but it also induced these beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae and c. freundii.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of the penem sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. sch 34343 was active, with mics generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci  (though enterococci were less susceptible with sch 34343 mics mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the bacteroides fragilis group), haemophilus influenzae and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was also active against the enterobacteriaceae though enterobacter cloacae and serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other  members of this group. sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of pseudomonas (including ps. aeruginosa) but was active against ps. acidovorans and some isolates of ps. cepacia. sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of aeromonas hydrophila and  more slowly by enzymes from ps. maltophilia and bact. melaninogenicus subspecies  intermedius. we did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  == the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle (16b; johnston laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. however, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. this in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16b to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16b and the 6b (conventional aerobic) bottles. the studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16b bottles. low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly.  the indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. the failure of the bactec 16b blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.

AB  == the in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the united states. a total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against enterobacteriaceae. of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had ctaz mics < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. only citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime mic(90s) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode mic 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. more than 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8  mg/l. in other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and streptococcus spp. enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime mic90 >8 mg/l. only cefsulodin (mode  mic 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode mic 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against ps. aeruginosa. ceftazidime mic(50s) for neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the mic, and was relatively unaffected  by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). it perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of types i-v and bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. ceftazidime inhibited only type i ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the national committee clinical laboratory standards (nccls). quality control data are presented. tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible mics of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. staph. aureus was the  species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones  or mics. we found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of 6059-s therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  == a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-s, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-s by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5  patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pneumoniae (1), haemophilus influenzae (4), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), enterobacter aerogenes (1), proteus morganii (1), psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and salmonella typhimurium (1). all the  patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-s therapy. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-s therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of got and gpt (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with  the 6059-s therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum 6059-s level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. csf concentrations in a case with haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-s. from the present study, 6059-s appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. it remains to be further determined whether 6059-s is superior to abpc in the treatment of haemophilus influenzae meningitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime  required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to  8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited  78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics  for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae  and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [cefotaxime csf levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the c.s.f. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae,  escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. compared to the m.i.c. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the c.s.f. are much higher than the m.i.c.'s. these results are comparable to those of previous studies. cefotaxime diffuses in the c.s.f. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against  haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == [cefotaxime, syn isomer of a new methoxyimino cephalosporin with unusual activity (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotaxime, the - syn - derivative of 7 - [(2-(2-amino-4-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino) acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin. in in vitro studies, it was 80 times more active than the - anti - derivative against beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacteria. the range of inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime against gram-negative bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae, susceptible or  resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins was from 0.01 to 0.1 micrograms/ml. this activity was consistently higher than that observed with cephalothin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cefazolin. nevertheless, some strains of enterobacter cloacae were resistant. cefotaxime showed very similar activity to that of ampicillin against group a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol.
AB  == we evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sch 24893, sch 25298, and sch 25393, three novel analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. all of the analogs had minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml for 18 chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant strains of shigella  dysenteriae and 21 strains of resistant salmonella typhi. the analogs were also more active than were chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol against chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria, including six strains of escherichia  coli, seven strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, and two strains of enterobacter cloacae. fifty-three strains of ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae were  uniformly susceptible to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the three analogs. sch 25298 was the most active compound tested (minimal inhibitory concentration,  0.5 microgram/ml for all strains). four of seven chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant haemophilus strains were susceptible to the fluorinated analogs. of the three haemophilus strains which were resistant to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the analogs, two contained less than 10% of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the strains which were resistant to only chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. we conclude that fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have considerable in vitro activity  against a broad spectrum of chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  == the sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter species, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. all bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. all strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. only non-identical strains were used. a tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. the results showed that all strains of h. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. the other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. cefoperazone had potent activity against ps. aeruginosa. differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. variation in ph, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. in escherichia coli cefmenoxime  showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (pbp-3), followed by pbp-1 (1a and 1b). this affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. the high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by proteus mirabilis.

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility of the cephalosporin ro 13-9904 to beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of  cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all proteus species. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. like cefotaxime and moxalactam, or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. it was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than  ampicillin against both bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from b. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of enterobacter cloacae.
