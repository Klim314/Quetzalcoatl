TI  == selection of bioprotective cultures for preventing cold-smoked salmon spoilage.
AB  == biopreservation is a natural technology of food preservation, which consists of inoculating food with microorganisms selected for their antibacterial properties. the objective of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) to improve the quality of cold-smoked salmon (css). in this work, different strains representative of the 4 dominant species, identified in a previous study by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene, were isolated and their spoiling potential in css blocks, sterilized by ionization, was assessed by twelve trained panelists along the vacuum storage at 8 degrees c. photobacterium phosphoreum, brochothrix  thermosphacta and serratia proteamaculans released strong off-odors whereas the spoiling potential of carnobacterium divergens was weaker. the spoiling capacity  of lactococcus piscium eu2241, leuconostoc gelidum eu2247, lactobacillus sakei eu2885, staphylococcus equorum s030674 and 4 commercial starters was tested by the same method and 2 strains were eliminated due to off-odor production. the effect of the 6 selected lab against the 4 specific spoiling organisms (ssos) selected was tested by challenge tests in sterile css blocks. the protective effect of the lab differed from one sso to another and no correlation could be established between the sensory improvement, sso inhibition, and the implantation or acidification of protective cultures (pcs). all the pcs except l. piscium reduced the off-odors released by p. phosphoreum although some of them had no effect on its growth. s. equorum, which did not grow in css, favored the implantation of p. phosphoreum but prevented its off-odor formation. l. piscium was the only strain that prevented the spoilage of b. thermosphacta and s. proteamaculans although it did not grow very well and did not acidify the product. l. gelidum eu2247 inhibited the growth of these 2 ssos and lowered the ph but had no effect on the sensory quality. finally, l. piscium was tested in 2  naturally contaminated products, with a positive effect on 1 batch. this effect was not correlated with the microbial ecosystem as determined by acultural and cultural techniques. based on these results, the selection strategy is discussed.
