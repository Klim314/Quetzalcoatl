TI  == preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  == background: the bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. this study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16s rrna sequencing. methods: tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. dna was extracted  from each sample and analyzed using 16s rrna cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. results: all dna samples were positive for 16s rrna gene pcr. one hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. in addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and fusobacterium (f.) nucleatum (8/11), dialister (d.) invisus (8/11), campylobacter (c.) gracilis (7/11), escherichia (e.) coli dh1 (6/11), aggregatibacter (a.) segnis (6/11), and streptococcus (s.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. furthermore, 45  as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. conclusions: chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. f. nucleatum, d. invisus, c. gracilis, e. coli dh1, a. segnis, and s. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16s rrna sequencing.

TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of fus-1 (oxa-85), a narrow-spectrum class d beta-lactamase from fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
AB  == previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. an f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. dna cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class d beta-lactamase named fus-1 (oxa-85). a recombinant escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(fus-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate  decrease in the mics with clavulanic acid. the bla(fus-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. it was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class d beta-lactamase gene. the fus-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with oxa-63 from brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). fus-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class d beta-lactamases. kinetic analysis revealed that fus-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. fus-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and nacl. fus-1 is the first example of a class d beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.
