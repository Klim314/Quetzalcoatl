TI  - Endopeptidase activities of selected Porphyromonas spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. of oral and non-oral origin.
AB  - The ability of three Porphyromonas spp., seven Prevotella spp., seven Fusobacterium spp. and two related Bacteroides spp. (B. levii and B. macacae) to degrade an extensive range of synthetic endo-, amino- and diamino peptidase substrates linked to the fluorescent leaving group 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (NHMec) was investigated. Many more species than was previously recognized exhibited peptidase activities, albeit at lower levels than those already described for Porphyromonas gingivalis. Detection of chymotrypsin-like activity was dependent on which of three NHMec-linked substrates was used, but all species exhibited degradative activity with at least one of these substrates. Elastase-like activity was detected in all species though not all species reacted with each of the elastase substrates. Glycylprolyl peptidase activity was detected in all of the species tested with the exception of F. mortiferum, F. gonidiaformans, F. naviforme and F. necrophorum. While the detection of peptidase activities does not appear to be useful for the differentiation of species within the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella, its ability to differentiate species of the genus Porphyromonas or Fusobacterium warrants further investigation.
TI  - 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  - The 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were determined for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides capillosus, Bacteroides veroralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Anaerorhabdus furcosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium varium. A dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the 5S rRNA dendrogram, Bacteroides clustered together with Cytophaga and Fusobacterium, as in 16S rRNA analyses. Intraphylum relationships deduced from 5S rRNAs suggested that Bacteroides is specifically related to Cytophaga rather than to Fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16S rRNA analyses. Previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus Bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5S rRNA sequence analysis.
