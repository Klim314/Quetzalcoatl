TI  == beta-lactamic resistance profiles in porphyromonas, prevotella, and parvimonas species isolated from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: susceptibility to beta-lactamic agents has changed among anaerobic  isolates from acute endodontic infections. the aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene in prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., and parviomonas micra strains and show its phenotypic expression. methods:  root canal samples from teeth with acute endodontic infections were collected and porphyromonas, prevotella, and parvimonas micra strains were isolated and microbiologically identified with conventional culture techniques. the susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration of benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin + clavulanate using the e-test method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). the presence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was determined through primer-specific polymerase chain reaction. the nitrocefin test was used to determine the expression of the lactamase enzyme. results: prevotella disiens, prevotella oralis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and p.  micra strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin  + clavulanate. the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was detected in 2 of 29 isolates (6.9%). simultaneous detection of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene and lactamase production was observed for 1 prevotella buccalis strain. the gene was in 1 p. micra strain but  was not expressed. three strains were positive for lactamase production, but the  cfxa/cfxa2 gene was not detected through polymerase chain reaction. conclusions:  there is a low prevalence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene and its expression in porphyromonas spp., prevotella spp., and p. micra strains isolated from acute endodontic infections. genetic and phenotypic screening must be performed simultaneously to best describe additional mechanisms involved in lactamic resistance for strict anaerobes.

TI  == rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. the purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. the isolates were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), eikenella corrodens (13.2%), prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), prevotella disiens (3.1%), peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), prevotella corporis (1.8%), peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). no periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). the number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. it is concluded that the  bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.
