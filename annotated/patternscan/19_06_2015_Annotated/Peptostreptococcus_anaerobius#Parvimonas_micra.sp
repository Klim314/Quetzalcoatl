TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. method: thirty ibd patients [15 with crohn's disease (cd) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (uc)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. all patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. from every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees  c until analysis using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. results: multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for bacteroides ureolyticus, campylobacter gracilis, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and treponema denticola (p<0.001). cd  patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than uc patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (p<0.05). cd patients harbored higher levels of p. melaninogenica, s. aureus, s. anginosus, and s. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (p<0.05). uc patients harbored higher levels of s. aureus (p=0.01) and p. anaerobius (p=0.05)  than controls only in gingivitis sites. conclusion: our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, ibd patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival  sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  == root canal microbiota of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  == samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. the most prevalent taxa were olsenella uli (74%), eikenella corrodens (63%), porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and bacteroidetes oral clone x083 (51%). when prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), bacteroidetes clone x083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by parvimonas micra (28%), e. corrodens (23%), and tannerella forsythia (19%). the number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the  first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. in addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with  this disease.

TI  == development of 16s rrna-based probes for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == fluorescent probes targeted at 16s rrna were designed for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus stomatis (pana134), parvimonas micra (pamic1435), finegoldia magna (fmag1250), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (pnasa1254), peptoniphilus ivorii (pnivo731), peptoniphilus harei (pnhar1466), anaerococcus vaginalis (avag1280) and anaerococcus lactolyticus (alac1438), based on the 16s rrna sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. these strains were also used for validation of the probes. application  of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) could be identified with this set of probes. the 16s rrnas of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. most of these isolates were gpac that were not targeted by the probes. no clinical isolates of pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. the fmag1250, pamic1435, pnhar1466, pana134, pnasa1254 and pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. the avag1280 and alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. however, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for  the majority of clinical isolates.
