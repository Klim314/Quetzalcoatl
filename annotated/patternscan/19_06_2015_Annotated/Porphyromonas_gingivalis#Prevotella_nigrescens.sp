TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == proinflammatory activity of primarily infected endodontic content against macrophages after different phases of the root canal therapy.
AB  == introduction: this study investigated the presence of target bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins in teeth with apical periodontitis. levels of inflammatory mediators (interleukin [il]-1beta and tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha) were determined after macrophage stimulation with endodontic content after different phases of endodontic therapy using different irrigants. methods:  thirty primarily infected root canals were randomly assigned into 3 groups according to the irrigant used for root canal preparation (n = 10 per group): gi: 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, gii: 2% chlorhexidine gel, and giii (control group): saline solution. root canal samples were taken by using paper points before (s1)  and after root canal instrumentation (s2), subsequently to 17% edta (s3), after 30 days of intracanal medication (ca[oh]2 + saline solution) (s4), and before root canal obturation (s5). polymerase chain reaction (16s recombinant dna) and limulus amebocyte lysate assay were used for bacterial and endotoxin detection, respectively. macrophages were stimulated with the root canal contents for il-1beta/tnf-alpha measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  porphyromonas gingivalis (17/30), porphyromonas endodontalis (15/30), and prevotella nigrescens (11/30) were the most prevalent bacterial species. at s1, endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canals (median = 32.43 eu/ml). in parallel, substantial amounts of il-1beta and tnf-alpha were produced by endodontic content-stimulated macrophages. at s2, a significant reduction in endotoxin levels was observed in all groups, with gi presenting the greatest reduction (p < .05). after a root canal rinse with edta (s3), intracanal medication (s4), and before root canal obturation (s5), endotoxin levels reduced  without differences between groups (p < .05). il-1beta and tnf-alpha release decreased proportionally to the levels of residual endotoxin (p < .05). conclusions: regardless of the use of sodium hypochlorite or chx, the greatest endotoxin reduction occurs after chemomechanical preparation. increasing steps of root canal therapy associated with intracanal medication enhances endotoxin reduction, leading to a progressively lower activation of proinflammatory cells such as macrophages.

TI  == the effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  == we have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and prevotella melaninogenica. in the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four fusobacteria species (fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, f. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. we also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm  with power density of 80 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 j/cm2. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light  at 455 nm with power density of 50 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 j/cm2. microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mw/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 j/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (cfu) assay. the selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard dna-dna format. in cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). hplc demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in  bacteria. following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). dna probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. the cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. this may introduce a new avenue of  prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in the patients with aortic aneurysm.
AB  == background: the occurrence and development of aortic aneurysm (aa) are associated with infection. some researchers have detected the dna of periodontal pathogens in aa samples in certain populations. however, it has not been done in chinese population. the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in oral tissue samples and aneurysm samples of aa patients. methods: eighty-nine subjects with aa and 59 subjects without aa were examined. periodontal clinical parameters were evaluated. unstimulated saliva and subgingival plaque samples were collected from all subjects. twenty-six dissected aa samples were obtained. evidence of eight periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), campylobacter rectus (cr), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), and prevotella nigrescens (pn) was ascertained in all samples by 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: the periodontal indexes including plaque index (pli), probing depth (pd), bleeding index (bi), and clinical attachment loss (cal), of the six ramfjord index teeth were significantly higher in the aa group  than those in the control group (p < 0.01). eight periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples were more frequently detected in the aa group than in  control group. the difference in prevalence between the groups was significant for six (out of eight) periodontal pathogens assayed (pg, pi, fn, pn, tf, and td, p < 0.01). additionally, all eight periodontal pathogens were more frequently detected in saliva samples of the aa group than in those of the control group, again with six (out of eight) (pg, pi, fn, cr, tf, and td) displaying significant differences in prevalence between the two groups (p < 0.01). out of 26 aneurysm samples examined, pg, pi, fn, cr and tf were detected in 6 (23.1%), 2 (7.7%), 3 (11.5%), 1 (3.8%), 2 (7.7%), respectively, and aa, pn, and td were not detected in dissected aneurysm samples. conclusion: results of this study suggested that periodontal infection is associated with the occurrence of aa.

TI  == periodontal pathogens directly promote autoimmune experimental arthritis by inducing a tlr2- and il-1-driven th17 response.
AB  == increasing epidemiologic evidence supports a link between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. the actual involvement of periodontitis in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and the underlying mechanisms remain, however, poorly understood. we investigated the influence of concomitant periodontitis on clinical and histopathologic characteristics of t cell-mediated experimental arthritis and evaluated modulation of type ii collagen (cii)-reactive th cell phenotype as a potential mechanism. repeated oral inoculations of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens induced periodontitis in mice, as evidenced by alveolar bone resorption. interestingly, concurrent periodontitis induced by both bacteria significantly aggravated the severity of collagen-induced arthritis. exacerbation of arthritis was characterized by increased arthritic bone erosion, whereas cartilage damage remained unaffected. both p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens skewed the cii-specific t cell response in lymph nodes draining arthritic joints toward the th17 phenotype without affecting th1. importantly, the levels of il-17 induced by periodontal pathogens in cii-specific t cells directly correlated with the intensity of arthritic bone erosion, suggesting relevance in pathology. furthermore, il-17 production was significantly correlated with periodontal disease-induced il-6 in lymph node cell cultures. the effects of the two bacteria diverged in that p. nigrescens, in contrast to p. gingivalis, suppressed the joint-protective type 2 cytokines, including il-4. further in vitro studies showed that the th17 induction strongly depended on tlr2 expression on apcs and was highly promoted by il-1. our data provide evidence of the involvement of periodontitis in the pathogenesis of t cell-driven arthritis through induction of ag-specific th17 response.

TI  == bacteriological analysis of necrotic pulp and fistulae in primary teeth.
AB  == objectives: primary teeth work as guides for the eruption of permanent dentition, contribute for the development of the jaws, chewing process, preparing food for digestion, and nutrient assimilation. treatment of pulp necrosis in primary teeth is complex due to anatomical and physiological characteristics and high number of bacterial species present in endodontic infections. the bacterial presence alone  or in association in necrotic pulp and fistula samples from primary teeth of boys and girls was evaluated. material and methods: necrotic pulp (103) and fistula (7) samples from deciduous teeth with deep caries of 110 children were evaluated. bacterial morphotypes and species from all clinical samples were determined. results: a predominance of gram-positive cocci (81.8%) and gram-negative coccobacilli (49.1%) was observed. in 88 out of 103 pulp samples, a high prevalence of enterococcus spp. (50%), porphyromonas gingivalis (49%), fusobacterium nucleatum (25%) and prevotella nigrescens (11.4%) was observed. porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in three out of seven fistula samples, enterococcus spp. in two out of seven samples, and f. nucleatum, p. nigrescens and d. pneumosintes in one out of seven samples. conclusions: our results show that enterococcus spp. and p. gingivalis were prevalent in necrotic pulp from deciduous teeth in boys from 2 to 5 years old, and that care of the oral cavity of children up to five years of age is important.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on epithelial cell migration in vitro.
AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

TI  == subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  == objective: the short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. methods: assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on  two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. one of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the  other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. no other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. results: significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative  periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. in comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. conclusions:  subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.

AB  == introduction: the development of periapical granulomas is dependent on the host response and involves th1, th2, th17, and treg-related cytokines. the discovery of new th9 and th22 subsets, with important immunomodulatory roles mediated by interleukin (il)-9 and il-22, respectively, emphasizes the need for reevaluation  of current cytokine paradigms in context of periapical lesions. we investigated the expression of il-9 and il-22 in active and stable human granulomas and throughout experimental lesion development in mice. methods: periapical granulomas (n = 83) and control specimens (n = 24) were evaluated regarding the expression of il-9 and il-22 via real-time polymerase chain reaction. experimental periapical lesions were induced in mice (pulp exposure and bacterial inoculation) and the lesions evolution correlation with il-9 and il-22 expression kinetics was evaluated. results: il-9 and il-22 mrna expression was higher in periapical lesions than in control samples; higher levels of il-9 and il-22 were  observed in inactive than in active lesions. in the experimental lesions model, increasing levels of il-9 and il-22 mrna were detected in the lesions, and inverse correlations were found between il-9 and il-22 and the increase of lesion area in the different time point intervals. conclusions: our results suggest that th9 and th22 pathways may contribute to human and experimental periapical lesion  stability.

TI  == detection and enumeration of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm of pregnant women.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use the fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) technique to test the hypothesis of qualitative and quantitative differences of 8 periodontopathogens between pregnant and non-pregnant women. this cross-sectional study included 20 pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant women. probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and presence of calculus were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected and the fish technique identified the presence and numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the mann-whitney u-test was applied to compare the data between the two groups. the mean age, ethnicity, marital status, education, and economic level in both groups were similar. the clinical parameters showed no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. the numbers of subgingival periodontopathogens were not found to be significantly different between groups, despite the higher mean counts of p. intermedia in pregnant women. colonization patterns of the different bacteria  most commonly associated with periodontal disease were not different in the subgingival plaque of pregnant and non-pregnant women.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. however, it remains unclear if scfas from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. this study investigated whether scfas-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture  supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of dna fragmentation and using an mts  assay kit, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the thp-1 and u937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in p. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mm) and f. nucleatum (36.0 mm) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in p. nigrescens and p. intermedia. these results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (rc) system and apical tissues. data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as rc with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (aaa), are scarce in the literature. the aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic rc and aaa using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. methods: paired samples of rc and aaa exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. the frequency of species was compared between the rc and the aaa samples. a stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate  the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. a dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. results: all samples harbored bacterial dna. porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella nigrescens, filifactor alocis, and tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both rc and aaa samples. the selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia.  the samples of rc and aaa that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. conclusions: anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of rc and aaa.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with signs of carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with and without periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: oral microorganisms may be involved in the development  of cardiovascular diseases, and porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the periodontal microorganisms that has been found in carotid atheroma. the aim of this work was to study subgingival microorganisms and early carotid lesions in subjects with and without periodontitis. material and methods: eighty-eight subjects with periodontitis and 40 subjects without periodontitis underwent dental examinations in 2003. the presence of the periodontal microorganisms aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia was analyzed from subgingival plaque using pcr amplification. the common carotid artery was scanned using ultrasound and the calculated intima-media area (cima) was measured. the association between periodontitis, the cima value and the presence of periodontal microorganisms, together with several confounders, was studied in a multiple logistic regression model. results: smoking [odds ratio (or) = 5.64; p = 0.001),  level of education (or = 5.02; p < 0.05) and the presence of p. gingivalis (or =  6.50; p < 0.05) were associated with periodontitis. explanatory factors for the increased cima were periodontitis (or = 4.22; p < 0.05), hypertension (or = 4.81; p < 0.05), high body mass index (or = 5.78; p < 0.01), male gender (or = 3.30; p  < 0.05) and poor socioeconomic status (or = 4.34; p < 0.05). p. nigrescens (or 4.08; p < 0.05) and p. gingivalis (or 7.63; p < 0.01) also appeared as explanatory variables associated with increased cima values. conclusion: this cross-sectional study showed that p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were significantly associated with increased cima values.

TI  == comparison of bacterial adhesion and cellular proliferation on newly developed three-dimensional scaffolds manufactured by rapid prototyping technology.
AB  == scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. for the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds. the cell growth  of human osteosarcoma cells (cal-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (plga, plla, plla-tcp) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, enterococcus  faecalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis). scanning electron microscopy (sem), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (cfu) were performed. the cell proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on plga. on  day 3 the proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp, and on day 5 on plla-tcp, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). the strain which showed the most cfus on all of the investigated scaffolds was p. gingivalis, followed by e. faecalis. no significant cfu differences were determined examining p. gingivalis among the biomaterials. in contrast, e. faecalis was significantly more adherent to plga and plla compared to plla-tcp. the lowest cfu values were seen with c. albicans and p. nigrescens.  salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to  plga compared to plla-tcp. these results supported by sem point out the high potential of plla-tcp in the field of tissue engineering.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == antigenicity of primary endodontic infection against macrophages by the levels of pge(2) production.
AB  == introduction: root canal contents are potent stimuli for proinflammatory cytokines involved in apical periodontitis. this study investigated target gram-negative bacterial species and endotoxins in primary endodontic infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of pge(2), and evaluated their relationship with clinical findings. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary infection  and apical periodontitis by using paper points. polymerase chain reaction (16s rdna) was used for bacterial detection and limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement. levels of prostaglandin e2 (pge(2)) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (duoset kit; r&d, minneapolis, mn). results: prevotella nigrescens (13/21), fusobacterium nucleatum (6/21), and porphyromonas  endodontalis (6/21) were the most frequently observed species. a positive association was found between f. nucleatum and p. endodontalis (p < .05). a correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins, such as pge(2) (p < .05). higher levels of endotoxin were detected in teeth with exudation, whereas elevated levels of pge(2) were found in teeth with tenderness to percussion and pain on palpation. conclusions:  our findings imply an additive effect between the number of gram-negative bacterial species involved in endodontic infection regarding the induction of proinflammatory cytokine by macrophage cells. moreover, teeth with clinical symptomatology were related to higher levels of endotoxins and pge(2) secretion.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis with different primers of subgingival bacterial communities under mechanical debridement.
AB  == dgge of 16s rdna is one of the most frequently used methods to study microbial communities. in this study, the dgge profiles of different 16s rdna regions of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and  prevotella nigrescens were investigated. the results suggested that v3-v5 and v6-v8 fragments may be suitable for community analysis of subgingival bacteria. further analysis of subgingival samples with v3-v5 and v6-v8 regions as target fragments suggested that, in chronic periodontitis, re-colonization by periodontal bacteria with a population very similar to the baseline may occur by  6 weeks after mechanical debridement.

TI  == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal bacteria in saliva of kuwaiti children at different age groups.
AB  == aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis and porphyromonas gingivalis and to a lesser extent prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, are gram-negative species that are associated with destructive periodontitis. studies from different parts of the world have shown variable detection rates of periodontal organisms. hardly any data exist on their carriage in children living in the middle east. this study was designed to determine the detection of these species in the oral cavity of 240 generally healthy kuwaiti children, divided into five age groups: <6 years (n=40), 6-9 years (n=60), 10-12 years (n=40), 13-15 years (n=40) and 16-18 years  (n=60). saliva was used as the microbiological specimen, and the samples were analyzed by molecular methods using multiplex pcr. a total of 185 (77.1%) of the  240 children were colonized by at least one of the target periodontal bacteria. in all age groups, p. nigrescens was the most prominent and detected in saliva of 15%, 32%, 63%, 50%, and 47% of the children at the five age groups, respectively. p. gingivalis was detected only occasionally. only few pathogens were found before the permanent dentition, i.e. at the age of <6 years. the highest carriage rates were from the groups between 6 and 15 years of age. the salivary carriage of the pathogens was essentially similar in the age groups of 10-12 years and 13-15 years. in conclusion, except for p. gingivalis, the examined periodontal pathogens are relatively common findings in kuwaiti children and colonize the oral cavity from childhood onwards.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic follow-up evaluations after non-surgical periodontal treatment with erbium:yag laser and scaling and root planing.
AB  == background: this study compared erbium-doped: yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (er:yag) laser irradiation (100 mj/pulse; 10 hz; 12.9 j/cm(2)) with or without conventional scaling and root planing (srp) to srp only for treatment of periodontal pockets. methods: nineteen patients with pockets from 5 to 9 mm were  included. in a split-mouth design, each site was allocated to a treatment group:  1) srpl, srp and laser; 2) l, laser; 3) srp, srp only; and 4) c, no treatment. clinical parameters of probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. visible plaque index, gingival bleeding index (gi), bleeding on  probing (bop), and subgingival plaque samples were also measured 12 days postoperatively, in addition to the above mentioned months. intergroup and intragroup statistical analyses were performed (p <0.05). results: gi decreased for srpl and increased for l, srp, and c (p <0.05) 12 days postoperatively and decreased for srpl and srp (p <0.05) 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline; bop and  pd decreased for all treated groups (p <0.01) 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. cal gain was significant for srpl, l, and srp (p <0.05) 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. srpl and l presented a significant reduction in the percentage of sites with bacteria 6 and 12 months after treatment (p <0.05). conclusion: non-surgical periodontal treatment with er:yag laser may be an alternative treatment for reduction and control of the proliferation of microorganisms in persistent periodontitis.

TI  == [effect of periodontal mechanical treatment on periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid of chronic periodontitis patients].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the subgingival prevalent rates of 6 periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluids of cp patients before and after treatment, to analyze the relationship between the prevalent variance and periodontal clinical parameters, and to provide a microbiologic method of evaluating curative effect and estimating the prognosis. methods: gingival crevicular fluids of 13 cp patients were collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment. also, gingival crevicular fluids were collected from 11 healthy subjects. six periodontal pathogenic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum(fn), prevotella nigrescens (pn) were detected by 16s rrna based pcr. results: the pli, pd, bi of the cp patients 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment were evidently less than those before treatment. these 4 months after treatment were a little more than those 2 months  after. the six bacteria were more frequently detected in the cp patients at baseline than in healthy controls. the prevalent rates of tf (42.1%, 73.7%, 70.2%), pg (47.4%, 68.4%, 77.2%), aa (15.8%, 22.8%, 7.0%), pn (38.6%, 57.9%, 64.9%), pi(15.8%, 38.6%, 42.1%) 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months following treatment were significantly lower than those at baseline (tf 96.5%, pg 93.0%, aa 36.8%, pn 86.0%, pi 84.2%), but the prevalent rates of all the detected bacteria  2 months after treatment were higher than those at 2 weeks after. conclusion: tf, pg, aa, pn and pi may cooperate in the development of cp. the changes of periodontal pathogenic bacteria could be detected before the changes of clinical  parameters and the patients should be re-evaluated and re-treated regularly within 2 months after treatment.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of moxifloxacin against gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: gram-negative enteric rods were associated with periodontal diseases  in several populations. the association between enteric and putative periodontal  pathogens has received little attention in the literature. the present investigation determined the occurrence and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods from colombian patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: clinical parameters and the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity of isolates of gram-negative enteric rods were examined in 76 patients with chronic periodontitis in medellin, colombia. subgingival samples were processed using culture and biochemical tests for the detection of periodontal and superinfecting pathogens. selected colonies of gram-negative enteric rods from pure cultures were used to test the susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. chi-square and mann-whitney tests were used to determine differences in clinical variables versus the presence or absence of gram-negative enteric rods. results: klebsiella pneumoniae was found in 12 patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in four patients, and three other species were recovered with a lower prevalence. men (38.75%) tended to harbor more of the studied organisms than women (17.7%) (p = 0.04). gram-negative enteric rods in periodontal pockets correlated positively with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (respectively, r = 0.66, 0.31, and 0.32; p <0.001). all superinfecting organisms demonstrated a high susceptibility to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin but exhibited a variable susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: this study found high levels of gram-negative enteric rods in  patients with chronic periodontitis. moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin appeared capable of eradicating these organisms from periodontal pockets. its good activity against gram-negative enteric rods and periodontopathogens suggests the  potential use of moxifloxacin as an adjunctive antibiotic in the treatment of mixed periodontal infections.

TI  == changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == the incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug chlo-site or metronidazole. even within two weeks, a turnover  of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. a relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. this should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

TI  == the identification of genes specific to prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens using genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, which are often isolated from periodontal sites, were once considered two different genotypes of p. intermedia. although the genomic sequence of p. intermedia was determined recently, little is known about the genetic differences between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the  subtractive hybridization technique is a powerful method for generating a set of  dna fragments differing between two closely related bacterial strains or species. we used subtractive hybridization to identify the dna regions specific to p. intermedia atcc 25611 and p. nigrescens atcc 25261. using this method, four p. intermedia atcc 25611-specific and three p. nigrescens atcc 25261-specific regions were determined. from the species-specific regions, insertion sequence (is) elements were isolated for p. intermedia. is elements play an important role in the pathogenicity of bacteria. for the p. intermedia-specific regions, the genes adenine-specific dna-methyltransferase and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase  were isolated. the p. nigrescens-specific region contained a flavobacterium psychrophilum spra homologue, a cell-surface protein involved in gliding motility, prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845 glutathione peroxide, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 leucyl-trna synthetase. the results demonstrate that the subtractive hybridization technique was useful for distinguishing between the two closely related species. furthermore, this technique will contribute to our understanding of the virulence of these species.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == proteolytic activities of oral bacteria on prommp-9 and the effect of synthetic proteinase inhibitors.
AB  == tissue reactions to bacteria lead to proinflammatory reactions involving matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). synthetic protease inhibitors may offer new possibilities to regulate bacterial proteases. we investigated proteolytic activities of certain periodontal bacteria, their effects on the latent prommp-9, and the effects of synthetic mmp inhibitors and a serine protease inhibitor pefabloc. the strains studied were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptoccus micros, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. their gelatinolytic activities and the effects of certain synthetic mmp inhibitors and  pefabloc were analyzed by zymography. bacterial effects on prommp-9 conversion were investigated by western immunoblot. all investigated periodontal bacteria produced gelatinolytic cell-bound and extracellular proteinases which could fragment latent prommp-9, suggesting co-operative processing cascades in oral tissue remodeling. a. actinomycetemcomitans produced the weakest gelatinolytic activity. synthetic proteinase inhibitors exhibited slight but clear reductive effects on the bacterial proteolytic activities. we conclude that targeted anti-proteolytic treatment modalities against bacterial-host proteolytic cascades can be developed.

TI  == similarities in the subgingival microbiota assessed by a curet sampling method at sites with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. methods: subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (pd) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966  subgingival sites). subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method identifying 37 species. results: probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and  16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. statistical analysis failed to demonstrate  differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (p = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (p = 0.78). with the exceptions of campylobacter gracilis  (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. a trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for prevotella nigrescens (p <0.01). at a  cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. conclusions: given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. this may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.

TI  == periodontal and microbiologic evaluation of 2 methods of archwire ligation: ligature wires and elastomeric rings.
AB  == introduction: prophylactic programs to prevent dental biofilm accumulation must be implemented to minimize the risk for periodontal diseases in orthodontic patients. therefore, we assessed the possible periodontal and microbiologic changes resulting from the use of 2 methods of orthodontic archwire ligation: elastomeric rings and steel ligatures. methods: the following parameters were measured: plaque index, gingival bleeding index, probing depth, and biofilm samples from the maxillary second premolars and the mandibular lateral incisors were evaluated in 14 subjects without clinical signs of gingival inflammation before orthodontic appliance placement and after 6 months of treatment. each orthodontic arch was fixed with elastomeric rings on 1 side of the midline, and steel ligatures were used on the opposite side. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and p nigrescens. results: the elastomeric rings were associated with a higher score for plaque index and bleeding than steel ligatures, as well as many positive sites of t forsythia and p nigrescens (p <0.05). conclusions: elastomeric rings favored these 2 periodontopathogens and harmed gingival conditions.

TI  == rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by maldi-tof-ms.
AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva is linked to periodontal health status and oral malodour.
AB  == this study investigated whether an improvement in periodontal health resulted in  changes in the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva and tongue coatings and a reduction in volatile sulfur compounds (vscs: h(2)s and ch(3)sh) linked to oral malodour. the subjects were 35 patients who visited the breath odour clinic of kyushu dental college, japan. their mean age was 51.2+/-18.3 years (mean+/-sd). a clinical examination performed at baseline and 2 months after periodontal treatment assessed vscs in mouth air using gas chromatography,  periodontal probing depth and bleeding on probing (bop) in all subjects; saliva and tongue coatings were also collected. genomic dna was isolated from the samples, and the proportions of five periodontopathogenic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens) were investigated using quantitative real-time pcr. the subjects were classified into four groups based on the presence of a periodontal pocket of more than 4 mm (pd) and vscs above the organoleptic threshold level (vsct) as follows: -pd/-vsct group, subjects without pd or vsct;  -pd/+vsct group, those without pd but with vsct; +pd/-vsct group, those with pd but without vsct; and +pd/+vsct group, those with pd and vsct. although the mean  pd values in the +pd/-vsct and +pd/+vsct groups, bop in the +pd/+vsct group, and  h(2)s and ch(3)sh concentrations in the -pd/+vsct and +pd/+vsct groups were greater than in the other groups at baseline, we found no significant difference  among the four groups after periodontal treatment. the proportion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva was higher in the +pd/-vsct and +pd/+vsct groups than in the -pd/-vsct and -pd/+vsct groups at baseline and after treatment, but the proportions of bacteria in saliva after treatment were reduced compared to the baseline. furthermore, the differences in the proportions of the  five target bacteria in the tongue coating were not as apparent as those in saliva at baseline or after treatment. the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva may reflect periodontal health status and influence vsc levels in mouth air.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == [subgingival microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis in bogota, colombia: an epidemiological approach].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis-associated microbiotas differ in regions around the world and vary with a variety of factors. this suggests that each country must establish its own dental microbiobiotic profile in order to formulate adequate prevention measures and more specific treatments. objective: the prevalence and proportions of the following microorganisms were investigated: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, micromonas micros, fusobacterium spp, dialister pneumosintes and enteric  rods. the patients selected had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis from clinical populations in bogota, colombia. the variables of age, gender and socioeconomic level were included in the comparisons. materials and methods: 183 patients were classified in two groups, chronic periodontitis (n=84) and aggressive periodontitis (n=59); 40 healthy subjects were selected for comparison. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the 6 deepest periodontal pockets in every patient and processed by culture for the isolation and identification of bacteria. results: in chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, fusobacterium spp and e. corrodens showed high and similar prevalence, whereas m. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, d. pneumosintes and enteric rods (commonly from the tribe klebsielleae) showed less  and similar prevalence. in the healthy group, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus and fusobacterium spp showed high frequency whereas m. micros and e. corrodens showed moderate frequency. conclusions: porphyromonas gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, fusobacterium spp. and e. corrodens are important constituents of the microbiologic profile of the periodontitis in colombian populations. porphyromonas gingivalis was found more frequently than a. actinomycetemcomitans in aggressive periodontitis.

AB  == background/aims: periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and/or tlr4. accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of tlr2 as compared to tlr4 triggering. the aim was to study the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella parvula with tlr2 and tlr4. we investigated all known serotypes (k(-), k1-k6) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. methods: human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably transfected with cd14, cd14-tlr2, or cd14-tlr4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all test bacteria stimulated hek-cd14-tlr2, but only a. actinomycetemcomitans and v. parvula stimulated hek-cd14-tlr4. no differences were found in the activation  of hek-cd14-tlr2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated tlr2, which may be of importance for the th1/th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial synergy in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis.
AB  == purpose of review: periodontitis is an infectious disease, but the specific mechanisms by which tooth-supportive tissues are lost remain obscure. this article proposes an infectious disease model for periodontitis in which herpesviral-bacterial interactions assume a major etiopathogenic role. recent findings: epstein-barr virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses occur at a high frequency in aggressive periodontitis lesions. also, herpesvirus-infected periodontitis lesions tend to harbor elevated levels of classic periodontopathic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister  pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans. summary: conceivably, a herpesvirus active infection in the periodontium impairs  local defenses, thereby permitting overgrowth and increased aggressiveness of periodontopathic bacteria. in turn, periodontal pathogenic bacteria may augment the virulence of periodontal herpesviruses. it is suggested that interactions among herpesviruses and specific bacterial species constitute an important pathogenetic feature of periodontitis and maybe also of various non-oral infections.

TI  == persistently high levels of periodontal pathogens associated with preterm pregnancy outcome.
AB  == background: few studies examining the association between periodontal diseases and preterm birth have explored the underlying microbial and antibody responses associated with oral infection. methods: a nested case-control study was performed using data from a recent interventional trial following the delayed-treatment control group of 31 subjects with periodontal diseases. the levels of eight oral bacteria and the maternal immunoglobulin g (igg) responses in serum to these bacteria were measured at antepartum and postpartum visits to determine the relationship to cases (preterm delivery <37 weeks' gestation) and controls (term delivery). results: antepartum, the levels of periodontal pathogens tended to be higher in the preterm (case group) deliveries compared to  the term deliveries (control group). maternal anti-porphyromonas gingivalis igg was significantly lower in the preterm group compared to the term group (p = 0.028). postpartum, levels of p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were statistically significantly higher in  preterm births compared to term deliveries, adjusting for baseline levels. the joint effects of red and orange microbial clusters were significantly higher in the preterm group compared to the term group. conclusions: high levels of periodontal pathogens and low maternal igg antibody response to periodontal bacteria during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for preterm delivery. further studies elucidating the role of the microbial load and maternal immune response as related to pregnancy outcome seem merited.

TI  == prevalence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria in saliva of a group of brazilian children with mixed dentition: 1-year longitudinal study.
AB  == aim: this study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola) in saliva of children with mixed dentition at two different time points, correlating these findings with a clinical parameter of gingival health. design: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection was used to determine the prevalence of these bacteria in saliva of 64  children in 2003 and 60 children in 2004. gingival health was assessed by gingival index. result: sixty-two (96.9%) and 50 (83.3%) children presented low gingival inflammation, whereas 2 (3.1%) and 10 (16.7%) had moderate scores in 2003 and 2004, respectively. majority of the children (81.3% in 2003 and 73.3% in 2004) had detectable levels of at least one of the bacteria. the prevalence found was of 4.7% and 1.7% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 6.3% and 8.3% for p. gingivalis, 23.4% and 48.3% for p. nigrescens (p < 0.05), and 71.9% and 50% for t. denticola (p < 0.05) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. no significant relationship between gingival index and presence of these bacteria and combination of different species was found. conclusion: a high percentage of children harboured at least one of the putative periodontal pathogens in saliva,  but presented periodontally healthy conditions.

TI  == periodontal and oral microbiological status of an adult population undergoing haemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the periodontal status and oral microbiological patterns of a population with end-stage renal disease (esrd), undergoing haemodialysis (hd). design: this was a cross-sectional study, involving 52 patients from the nephrology department and 52 matched control subjects. materials and methods: the subjects had a periodontal clinical  examination; subgingival plaque samples were taken and analysed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to detect porphyromas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were studied for candida and enterobacteriaceae. main outcome measures: most of the 104 subjects had some degree of loss of periodontal attachment (lpa) > or =3  mm [11 (10.5%) had severe lpa; 16 (15.4%) moderate lpa; and 64 (61.5%) mild lpa]. only 13 subjects (12.5%) presented good periodontal health. results: no statistically significant differences were found between the hd patients and the  control group regarding bleeding index, number of teeth, or percentage of lpa > or =3 mm. however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the degree  of oral hygiene. conclusions: on the basis of the findings presented here, we cannot associate esrd with more severe periodontal destruction. although hd patients presented a higher number of periodontopathic microorganisms than the matched controls, a prolonged duration of hd did not bear a statistically significant relationship with the percentage of sites with lpa > or =3 mm, specific microbiota or composition of biofilm.

TI  == interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize il-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (lps). monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedius, veillonella atypical and prevotella nigrescens. il-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. in addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from p. gingivalis and other bacteria. the role of p. gingivalis proteases was tested using arg-x and lys-x mutant strains. the role of lps was investigated using purified p. gingivalis lps and polymixin depletion. all species tested induced significant il-1alpha production, but p. gingivalis was the weakest. co-stimulation of monocytes with p. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce il-1alpha production. this effect was at its greatest with c. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. however, 100 ng/ml of p. gingivalis lps can reproduce the antagonistic activity of p. gingivalis culture supernatants. periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate il-1alpha production by monocytes. p. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its lps appears to be the crucial component. this study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory  cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens in chronic endodontic infection.
AB  == black-pigmented anaerobic rods such as prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. are involved in the etiology and perpetuation of endodontic infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these species in chronic endodontic  infections by using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. samples of 100 patients with root canals displaying chronic endodontic infections were obtained by sterilized paper points. bacterial identification was performed  by using culture and pcr techniques. by culture, in 33% of the samples, p. intermedia-p. nigrescens (75.8%), p. gingivalis (27.3%), and p. endodontalis (9.1%) were identified, and by pcr 60% of the samples harbored p. nigrescens (43.3%), p. gingivalis (43.3%), p. intermedia (31.7%), and p. endodontalis (23.3%). the presence of these black-pigmented anaerobic rods alone or in association in chronic endodontic infections seems to be frequent. pcr is a very  sensitive technique for detecting dna from bacterial cells. culturing is only able to reveal living bacteria and is less sensitive for the identification of low numbers of bacterial cells.

TI  == synovial inflammation in active rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis facilitates trapping of a variety of oral bacterial dnas.
AB  == objective: to investigate the presence of oral bacterial dnas in serum and synovial fluid (sf) of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and psoriatic arthritis (psa). methods: serum and sf samples from 16 ra patients, 14  psa patients, and 9 osteoarthritis (controls) patients were extracted for oral bacterial dna. this was used in a checkerboard dna-dna-hybridization set up, to identify 40 different bacteria. results: mean number +/- standard deviation (sd)  of oral bacterial species in sera were 6.2 (3.2) in the ra group (p = 0.004) and  5.4 (2.7) in the psa group (p = 0.009) compared to 2.1 (1.7) in the controls. periodontitis associated species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens were exclusively detected in ra and psa. mean number (+/- sd) of oral  bacterial species in sf were 14.0 (6.8) in the ra (p = 0.001) and 19.4 (7.1) in the psa group (p < 0.001) compared to 4.0 (1.7) in controls. p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and prevotella intermedia were exclusively identified in  ra and psa sf. higher means of dnas were found in ra sf compared to ra serum (p < 0.001), and in psa sf compared to psa serum (p < 0.001). higher concentrations of bacterial dnas were found in ra and psa compared to controls. conclusion: higher  variety and concentrations of oral bacterial dnas were found in sf compared to serum of ra and psa patients. these findings indicate that synovial inflammation  in ra and psa may favor trapping of oral bacterial dnas, suggesting a perpetuating effect of oral pathogens in joint disease.

TI  == clinical and microbiological profiles of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive brazilians undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy and hiv-seronegative brazilians with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study compares the periodontal clinical profile and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive and hiv-seronegative subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 172 subjects were distributed into two hiv-seropositive groups (37 chronic periodontitis [h+cp+] and 35 periodontally healthy [h+cp-] individuals) and two hiv-seronegative groups (49 chronic periodontitis [h-cp+] and 51 periodontally healthy [h-cp-] subjects). subgingival samples were collected from six sites with the deepest probing depth in the periodontitis groups and six random sites in the groups with periodontal health. all hiv-infected patients had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart)  for at least 2 years. the presence and levels of 33 bacterial species were detected by dna probes and the checkerboard method. kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney tests were used to seek for significant differences among and between groups. results: h-cp+ patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction and inflammation than h+cp+ patients, whereas h+cp- subjects presented a greater percentage of sites with bleeding than h-cp- subjects (p <0.01). patients who were hiv seronegative showed higher prevalence and levels of most bacterial species than hiv seropositive patients. periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas noxia were more frequently detected in h-cp+ subjects compared to h+cp+ and controls. in contrast, enterococcus faecalis and acinetobacter baumannii were more commonly found in hiv-infected than in non-hiv-infected subjects (p <0.05). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens are more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of hiv-seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas species not usually associated with periodontitis are detected in higher frequency in hiv-seropositive subjects under haart.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of periodontally untreated mexican subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and aim: specific microbial profiles that may distinguish between generalized aggressive-periodontitis (gagp) and generalized chronic-periodontitis (gcp) have, to date, not been described. the purpose of the present study was to  describe the subgingival microbial composition of mexican subjects with gagp and  compare it with that of individuals with gcp and periodontal health (ph). material and methods: seventy-seven subjects with gagp (n=19), gcp (n=39) and ph  (n=19) were selected. clinical measurements included plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. up to 28 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each subject and analysed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: gagp and gcp subjects harboured significantly higher levels and/or proportion of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (levels: p<0.001, proportion: p<0.01), prevotella nigrescens (p<0.05 levels) and "red" complex species (p<0.001 proportion) than ph subjects. all gagp subjects were carriers of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens. no significant differences in any of the 40 microbial species  tested were detected between gagp and gcp subjects. conclusions: our results revealed that the microbial differences between gagp and gcp subjects were only discrete and none of the bacterial species tested seemed to specifically differentiate the subgingival microbial profile of either periodontitis group.

TI  == changes in the subgingival microbiota and periodontal parameters before and 3 months after bracket placement.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque is organized in a biofilm complex that provides protection and nutrients for periodontopathic bacteria. several factors can affect microbial colonization, including restorations and orthodontic brackets. the aim of this study was to investigate changes in subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters before and after bracket placement. methods: clinical parameters and subgingival microbial samples were collected from 30 patients before and after bracket placement. thirty additional patients with no orthodontic treatment served as controls. samples were cultured and analyzed for  periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria. a descriptive analysis was conducted, and chi-square, student t, wilcoxon matched, and mann whitney rank sum tests were used to test for differences between groups (p < or=.05). results: no  changes in probing depth or clinical attachment level were observed, but scores for bleeding on probing, plaque index, and gingival index increased after bracket placement (p < or =.05). porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium species were elevated in the experimental group after bracket placement compared with the control group (p < or =.01). superinfecting microorganisms such as enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens were  also found. conclusions: bracket placement influences the accumulation of plaque  and the colonization of important periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria, resulting in more inflammation and bleeding. special attention should be paid to  oral hygiene methods in orthodontic patients.

AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of porphyromonas endodontalis, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. tannerae from clinical samples using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcr).  two different multiplex pcr protocols were used (one for the two porphyromonas species and the other for the three prevotella species), each one using a primer  pair specific for each target species. the results were compared to those of the  conventional culture procedures. microbial samples were taken aseptically from 40 infected root canals and abscesses from patients. samples were cultured in an anaerobic condition for conventional identification using a rapid id 32 a kit. multiplex pcr was processed using the dna extracted from each sample. at least one of the five species of black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) were detected in 65% (26 of 40) of the samples using multiplex pcr, and in 15% (6 of 40) using the conventional culture procedures. multiplex pcr was more rapid, sensitive, specific, and effective in detecting bpb than the conventional culture procedures.

TI  == relationship of periodontal bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis fima variations with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == objectives: we investigated the relationship between phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth (go) and the harboring of periodontal bacteria. materials and methods: periodontal conditions and subgingival bacterial profiles were examined in 450 sites of 75 subjects. a polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect six bacterial species; porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), and prevotella nigrescens (pn). genetic variations of the pg fima gene were also examined. bacterial occurrence was compared with the severity of go, and alterations in the bacterial occurrence rate and quantities were monitored following periodontal treatment. results: the occurrences of aa, td, pi, pn, and pg with type ii fima (type ii pg) were significantly associated with the severity of go. td occurrence was reduced in association with gingival improvement following ultrasonic scaling, however, no such relationship was observed with aa, pi, pn, and pg. in addition, pg and pi markedly persisted after treatment. clinical improvement of the sites, following an er:yag laser treatment, significantly associated with quantitative reduction of pg in improved sites, however, not that of pi. conclusion: type ii pg and td were each found to  have a significant relationship with the development and deterioration of go.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of periodontal abscesses.
AB  == background/aim: the knowledge of clinical features, microbial composition and susceptibility to antimicrobials of periodontal abscesses has recently improved.  this descriptive clinical and microbiological study provides more information on  the characteristics of periodontal abscesses. materials and methods: clinical parameters and subgingival samples were examined from 54 subjects presenting 60 periodontal abscesses. samples were cultured for anaerobic and facultative bacteria, and data were expressed as frequency detection and mean proportion of isolation for microorganisms. selected isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens were used to test susceptibility to amoxicillin, azithromycin, tetracycline and metronidazole. statistical descriptive analysis was conducted. results: most periodontal abscesses were present in patients with ongoing chronic periodontitis. bleeding on probing, tumefaction and suppuration were present in almost all abscesses. affected teeth were lower anterior teeth, upper anterior teeth and lower molars. the subgingival microbiota was composed of periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium spp. (75%), p. intermedia/nigrescens (60%), p. gingivalis (51%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (30%). some periodontopathogens showed antimicrobial resistance to tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin, but not to azithromycin. conclusions: periodontal abscesses showed typical clinical features associated with untreated periodontitis, and the organisms identified were important periodontopathic bacteria. rationale use of antibiotic  adjunctive therapy in abscess treatment should be taken into account.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin.
AB  == purpose: to analyse the microbial flora in specific sites in 20 dentate (> or = 16 teeth) subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin and  in 20 controls matched according to age, sex and number of teeth. materials and methods: the microbial samples were analysed for the following micro-organisms: mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp., associated with the development of caries, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, associated with plaque accumulation and gingivitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, frequently found in elevated numbers in periodontitis sites and candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics and enterococci, associated with mucosal infections. the total microbial count was also registered, together with the total number of streptococci, associated with good oral health. results: in the hyposalivation group, the mean age was 54 +/- 8 years and the mean number of teeth 25 +/- 3. the unstimulated secretion rate was 0.04 +/- 0.04 ml/min and the  stimulated secretion rate 0.98 +/- 0.51 ml/min. compared with the controls, the hyposalivation group tended to harbour a lower number and proportion of f. nucleatum on the tongue, and an increased number of enterococci in the vestibular region. in the supragingival plaque, the numbers of strepococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased and the number of c. albicans tended to be increased. conclusion: the results indicate that subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin have a supragingival plaque  associated with the development of caries.

TI  == oral bacteria in the occluded arteries of patients with buerger disease.
AB  == objective: recent studies have suggested that infectious organisms play a role in vascular diseases. in this study, to explore a possible link between oral infection and buerger disease, we investigated whether oral (periodontal) bacteria were present in occluded arteries removed from patients with characteristic buerger disease. methods: fourteen male patients with a smoking history who had developed characteristics of buerger disease before the age of 50 years were included in this study. occluded arteries, including superficial femoral (n = 4), popliteal (n = 2), anterior tibial (n = 4), and posterior tibial (n = 4) arteries, were removed and studied. a periodontist performed a periodontal examination on each patient and collected dental plaque and saliva samples from them at the same time. the polymerase chain reaction method was applied to detect whether seven species of periodontal bacteria--porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia , and prevotella nigrescens--were present in the occluded arteries and oral samples. in addition,  arterial specimens from seven control patients were examined by polymerase chain  reaction analysis. results: dna of oral bacteria was detected in 13 of 14 arterial samples and all oral samples of patients with buerger disease. treponema denticola was found in 12 arterial and all oral samples. campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and prevotella nigrescens were found in 14% to 43% of the arterial samples and 71% to 100% of the oral samples. a pathologic examination revealed that arterial specimens showed the characteristics of an intermediate-chronic-stage or chronic-stage lesion of buerger disease. all 14 patients with buerger disease had moderate to severe periodontitis. none of the control arterial samples was positive for periodontal bacteria. conclusions: this is the first study to identify oral microorganisms in the lesions of buerger disease. our findings suggest a possible etiologic link between buerger disease and chronic infections  such as oral bacterial infections.

TI  == prevalence of putative periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques from gingivitis lesions in korean orthodontic patients.
AB  == the objective of this study was to detect and compare the presence of periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaques of gingivitis lesions in adults who wore fixed orthodontic appliances, as opposed to adults who did not wear any  orthodontic appliances. thirty-six individuals participated in this study. nineteen of these subjects did not wear any orthodontic appliances, and these subjects comprised the control group. the other 17 individuals had been wearing fixed orthodontic appliances for at least 3 months each. after a periodontal examination, we collected subgingival plaque samples from the gingivitis lesions  of each patient. using pcr based on 16s rdna, we detected the presence of 6 putative periodontopathogenic species, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. with regard to the presence of individual periodontopathogens, we found that t. forsythia, t. denticola, and p. nigrescens were significantly more common in the  samples obtained from the orthodontic patients than in the samples obtained from  the non-orthodontic patient controls. our results indicate that the local changes associated with the wearing of fixed orthodontic appliances may affect the prevalence of periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in endodontic lesions detected by culture and by pcr.
AB  == he aim of this study was to investigate the presence of four black-pigmented bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, in endodontic infections by culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analyses. microbial samples were obtained from 50 teeth with untreated necrotic pulps (primary infection) and from 50 teeth with failing endodontic treatment (secondary infection). microbiological strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation, and identification. for pcr detection, the samples were analyzed using species-specific primers of 16s rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region. culture and pcr detected the test species in 13/100 and 50/100 of the study teeth, respectively. the organisms were cultured from 11/50 (22%) of primarily infected root canal samples and from 2/50 (4%) of secondary root canal samples. pcr detection identified the target species in 32/50 (64%) and 18/50 (36%) of primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. gingivalis was rarely isolated by culture methods (1%), but was the most frequently identified test species by pcr (38%). similarly, p. endodontalis was not recovered by culture from any tooth studied, but was detected by pcr in 25% of the sampled teeth. pcr-based identification also showed higher detection rates of p. intermedia (33%) and p. nigrescens (22%) than culture (13%). in conclusion, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. intermedia, and p. nigrescens were identified more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment. also, a higher frequency of black-pigmented species was detected by pcr than by culture.

TI  == clinical consequences of il-1 genotype on early implant failures in patients under periodontal maintenance.
AB  == background: implant failure and biologic complications such as periimplantitis are not completely avoidable. are there any genetic and microbiologic parameters  that could be used to identify patients at risk for implant failure, preferably prior to treatment? this would result in improvement of the diagnostics, treatment decision, and risk assessment. purpose: the aims of this retrospective  study were to describe (1) the absolute failure rate of branemark system implants (nobel biocare ab, goteborg, sweden) consecutively installed over a 10-year period in partially edentulous patients treated for periodontal disease prior to  implant treatment and under regular professional maintenance, (2) the rate of interleukin-1 (il-1) polymorphism in those patients who experienced at least one  implant failure during the first year of function, and (3) the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in dental and periimplant sites with and without signs of inflammation. material and methods: of 766 patients, 81 encountered at least one  implant failure; 22 patients were clinically examined and were tested genetically for il-1 genotypes. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella nigrescens was analyzed. results: the absolute implant survival rate for the whole population was 95.32%; 10.57% of the patients encountered an implant loss. implant loss in the examined group (n = 22) was 32 of 106 (30.1%); 10 (45%) of the 22 patients were smokers, and 6 (27%) of the 22 patients were il-1 genotype positive. patients positive for il-1 genotype  were not more prone to implant loss; however, a significant synergistic effect with smoking was demonstrated. between patients who were il-1 genotype positive and those who were il-1 genotype negative, the differences in regard to bleeding  on probing or periodontal pathogens did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: the overall implant failure rate in a population treated and maintained for periodontal disease is similar to that of healthy subjects. a synergistic effect found between smoking and a positive il-1 genotype resulted in a significantly higher implant loss. this indicates that further research with a  larger patient group should focus on multifactorial analysis for adequate risk assessment.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens in atherosclerotic vessels.
AB  == background: epidemiological studies have shown that periodontitis may be associated with presence of atherosclerosis. dna from periodontal pathogens has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions, but viable oral bacteria have not yet been isolated from atherosclerotic plaques. the purpose of the present study was  to determine if viable oral bacteria could be isolated from atherosclerotic lesions and if dna from periodontal pathogens could be detected by use of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. methods: seventy-nine specimens of atherosclerotic plaque removed from carotid or femoral arteries during surgery were immediately transferred to reduced transport fluid and brought to the laboratory. the calcified tissue was meticulously cut into fine pieces and used for cultivation of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, and oral streptococci. the material from 24 of the specimens was homogenized, dna was extracted, and pcr amplification of 16s rdna with universal and specific primers was carried out. finally, the pcr products were sequenced. results: none of the samples yielded growth of the oral bacteria  under investigation. in all the 24 specimens bacterial dna was detected and likewise dna of p. intermedia was found in the samples. p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis were found sporadically. conclusions: viable oral bacteria could not be isolated from the atheromas, but the data confirm that dna of periodontal pathogens can be detected in atherosclerotic plaques. however, the finding that dna from p. intermedia constantly occured in the examined samples was new. further studies may focus on the simultaneous occurrence of identical clones of this species in subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaques.

TI  == phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria.
AB  == we have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. we hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. cultures of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 j/cm2, whereas p. melaninogenica required 21 j/cm2. exposure to light with a fluence of  42 j/cm2 produced 99% killing of p. gingivalis. high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in bpb. the amounts of endogenous porphyrin in bpb were 267 (p. intermedia), 47 (p. nigrescens), 41 (p. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (p. gingivalis) ng/mg. analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by dna-dna hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four bpb was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences  of 4.2 and 21 j/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. the present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control bpb growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  == objective: pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (plbw)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. there is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence plbw infants. recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for plbw. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and plbw by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. methods:  clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum.  subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were  analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. in all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. statistical methods included student's t-test, fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. results: the cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). there were no statistically  significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental  and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than  in the cases (p<0.05). the occurrence rates of p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and s. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). according to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, p. micros and c. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of plbw (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). conclusion: the present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, p. micros and c. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for plbw, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of plbw. further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and plbw.

AB  == herpesviruses appear to assume a major etiopathogenic role in various types of destructive periodontal disease. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) and hcmv-ebv co-infection are closely associated with disease-active periodontitis in juveniles and adults, with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis in children, and with periodontal abscesses. in particular, hcmv reactivation in periodontitis lesions seems to be linked to advancing disease. hcmv infects periodontal monocytes/macrophages and t-lymphocytes, and ebv infects periodontal b-lymphocytes. herpesvirus-infected inflammatory cells generate a great variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may possess diminished ability to defend against bacterial challenge. herpesvirus-associated periodontal sites tend to harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including dialister pneumosintes, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in summary, the available data suggest that periodontitis occurs more frequently and progresses more rapidly in herpesvirus-infected than in non-infected periodontal sites. an infectious disease model based on herpesvirus-bacteria-host immune response interactions is  presented to explain how a gingivitis lesion or a stable periodontal site with increased probing depth may convert into a tissue-destroying periodontitis lesion.

TI  == the distribution of periodontopathic bacteria among japanese children and their parents.
AB  == objective and background: it is not well known how periodontopathic bacteria colonize in the oral cavity during childhood. the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in oral cavities of children and their parents and the relationship between the bacterial findings and clinical parameters. methods: fifty-six children (mean age: 8.3 +/- 3.5, range: 1-15 years), including 15 with deciduous dentition, 26 with mixed dentition and 15 with permanent dentition, and their parents participated in this study. whole saliva and dental plaque of the children and whole saliva of their parents were collected for detection of seven species of periodontopathic bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis (bacteroides forsythus), campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) using the polymerase chain reaction method. clinical parameters including simplified oral hygiene index and papillary-marginal-attachment index were recorded for the children and their accompanied parents. results: the detection frequencies of t.  forsythensis, c. rectus, p. nigrescens, t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in the oral cavities of children were 42.9%, 94.6%, 42.9%, 48.2%, 1.8% and 8.9%, respectively. t. forsythensis, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were detected more frequently in the saliva of parents (54.8%, 54.8%, 88.1%, respectively) than in the saliva of children (25.5%, 7.3%, 41.8%, respectively). different detection frequencies of p. nigrescens were found among  the oral cavities of children with deciduous, mixed and permanent dentitions. in  mixed dentition, females harbored t. forsythensis more frequently than males did. children who harbored t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and t. denticola showed high scores for oral debris measurement by simplified oral hygiene index. t. forsythensis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected more frequently in children whose parents were positive for these pathogens than  in children whose parents were negative. conclusions: high plaque retention seems to promote the colonization of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of children. t. forsythensis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected more frequently in the oral cavities of children whose parents already harbored these  bacteria. familial transmission of these bacteria is suggested.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261.
AB  == aims: to characterize the antimicrobial activity produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261, and to evaluate its safety on cultured gingival fibroblasts. methods and results: an antimicrobial activity was obtained from purifying the culture supernatant of pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. purification of the active compound was achieved with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. as revealed by sds-page, the active fraction was relatively homogeneous, showing a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 41 kda. the antimicrobial compound, named nigrescin, exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and actinomyces spp. nigrescin was stable in a ph range between 6.5 and 9.5, at 100 degrees c for 10 min, and resistant to lyophilization. but its activity was lost after proteinase k treatment. despite at very high concentrations beyond the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), nigrescin was not toxic to the gingival fibroblasts. conclusion: nigrescin is a novel bacteriocin produced by pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. it exhibits antimicrobial activity against species that are implicated in  periodontal diseases. the absence of toxicity on the gingival fibroblasts suggests the possibility in using of nigrescin for an application in periodontal  treatment. significance and impact of the study: novel evidence on nigrescin would make pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 attractive in biotechnological applications  as an antimicrobial agent in clinical dentistry.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic changes after removal of orthodontic appliances.
AB  == the goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological factors associated with orthodontic appliances during an episode of gingival inflammation and the impact of appliance removal on periodontal health. this prospective study included 10 patients, aged 12 to 20 years, with clinical signs of gingival inflammation at the final phase of orthodontic treatment (appliance removal). plaque index, gingival index, and probing depth were evaluated, and microbiological samples were collected from teeth 16, 11, and 26 at 2 times: during the gingival inflammation (baseline) and 30 days after the removal of the  appliance and professional prophylaxis. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. a statistically significant improvement of the plaque and gingival indexes was seen, as well as a reduction in probing depth (p <.05). periodontal pathogens were associated with gingival inflammation during orthodontic treatment. the improvement in periodontal health at 30 days was concomitant with a reduction of  sites positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus (p <.05). periodontal pathogens associated with gingival inflammation during orthodontic treatment can be significantly reduced by orthodontic appliance removal and professional prophylaxis.

TI  == selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  == bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. this study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. the apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions  was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. the results showed that pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), treponema denticola in 6 (26%), fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%).  no sample yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, or campylobacter  rectus. of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.

AB  == objectives: the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial profile and to seek possible bacterial associations in the subgingival microbiota of early onset periodontitis/aggressive periodontitis patients by using two different techniques, culture and immunofluorescence. material and methods: the study group consisted of 66 systemically healthy individuals with evidence of early onset periodontitis - 41 females and 25 males aged 23-35 years (mean 31.1 +/- 3.1 years). bacterial samples were collected from the deepest site in each quadrant, resulting in a total of 264 sites with a mean probing pocket depth of 6.6 +/- 1.5 mm. samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and nonselective media, and isolates were characterized to species level. indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies was applied to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (bacteroides forsythus, tannerella forsythensis), prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii. results: 93.6% of sampled sites showed bleeding on probing and 23.5% were positive for suppuration. p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p.  gingivalis, and c. rectus were detected in 77.3-85.9% of samples using culture methods and in 85.6-91.3% using immunofluorescence. p. micros and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found, respectively, in 63.3% and 25.0% of all sites using culturing and in 58.7% and 27.7% sites using immunofluorescence. significantly strong positive associations were observed between t. forsythia and c. rectus (odds ratio 109.46), and t. forsythia and p. gingivalis (odd ratio 90.26), whereas a negative association was seen between p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio 0.42). coinfection by p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and c. rectus was observed  in 62.1% of the test sites, and in 89.4% of the studied subjects. the sensitivity of immunofluorescence for t. forsythia, c. rectus, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis was found to be very high (0.99-0.94) using culture as the reference detection method. the agreement between culture and immunofluorescence  in detecting the presence or absence of the investigated species was 85.2-88.1% for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and t. forsythia, 75.9% for a. actinomycetemcomitans and 70.4% for p. micros. conclusions: the microbial profile of the early onset/aggressive periodontitis population was complex. the agreement between the two detection methods was very high.

TI  == initial antimicrobial effect of controlled-release doxycycline in subgingival sites.
AB  == objectives: to determine the ability of a 10% doxycycline hyclate controlled-release polymer (atridox) to suppress periodontopathic bacteria when placed subgingivally following scaling and root planing (sc/rp). methods: eight males and seven females, mean age 48 years, with moderate to advanced periodontitis participated in the study. in each patient, bilateral periodontal pockets probing 6-7 mm were randomly assigned to treatment by sc/rp + doxycycline polymer or by sc/rp alone. subgingival placement of doxycycline polymer was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. sc/rp was performed with hand instruments for at least 10 min in each study tooth. subgingival samples were collected by paper-points at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks post-treatment. culture methodology was used to isolate and identify putative periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter species, eubacterium species, fusobacterium species, peptostreptococcus micros, eikenella corrodens, staphylococcus species, enteric gram-negative rods, beta-hemolytic streptococci and yeasts. the microbiologic examination was carried out blindly. microbiological data were analyzed using a general linear model analysis of variance for within and between group effects. results: sites receiving sc/rp + doxycycline polymer and sites receiving sc/rp alone exhibited similar levels of periodontal pathogens at baseline and did not differ significantly in total viable counts and proportional recovery of periodontopathic bacteria post-treatment. conclusions: controlled-release doxycycline placed in moderate to deep periodontal pockets caused no significant additional reduction in the subgingival pathogenic microbiota compared to thorough sc/rp alone. since controlled-release doxycycline may not significantly suppress several subgingival pathogenic microorganisms and seems to possess no distinct advantage over broad-spectra, safe and inexpensive antiseptics, the rationale for its employment in periodontal therapy remains unclear.

TI  == microbiological shifts in intra- and extraoral habitats following mechanical periodontal therapy.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to analyze the intra- and extraoral  colonization dynamics of periodontal pathogens following supra- and subgingival debridement. material and methods: thirty five patients with chronic periodontitis were enrolled in the study. supra- and subgingival plaque samples,  saliva, and swab samples from mucosa and extraoral sites were taken at baseline and 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after mechanical periodontal therapy. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), eikenella corrodens (ec), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and treponema denticola (td) were identified by pcr. results: supra- and subgingival debridement decreased the number of subgingival sites infected with the analyzed pathogens only transiently, if at all. however, the detection frequencies of tf, td, ec, pi, and pn in the supragingival region, of pg, td, and pn at the oral mucosa sites (mostly the tongue), and of all pathogens except aa in saliva increased over the 6-month observation period. td was the only pathogen recorded in notable quantities in the extraoral habitat (external ear canal). conclusion: the results indicate that supra- and subgingival debridement results in a dissemination of periodontal pathogens within the oral cavity.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial outcome in patients with recurrent periodontal disease following treatment with 25% metronidazole gel using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty subjects in a maintenance care  program but with recurrent periodontal disease participated. three months after scaling and root planing a total of 40 sites, 2 in each patient, with pocket probing depth of > or = 5 mm were selected. one site randomly selected was treated with 25% metronidazole gel (test) and the other site with a placebo gel (control). a bacterial sample was collected on paperpoint from each test and control site at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment. the following pathogens were analysed and detected with pcr:actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.),  porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and prevotella nigrescens (p.n.). at baseline, a.a., p.g. and p.n. were detected in 30, 60 and 70% of all test sites and in 32,  58 and 21% of all control sites. there was a statistically significant difference between the test and control sites for p.n. at baseline. the major difference after treatment with 25% metronidazole gel was the increase of positive control sites for p.g. and p.n. however, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence rate of a.a., p.g. and p.n. at test and control sites after treatment. this study has shown that 25% metronidazole gel treatment  did not seem to influence the microbial outcome, when pcr was used to analyse the presence/absence of a.a., p.g. and p.n. in this group of subjects with recurrent  periodontal disease.

TI  == effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. a total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x  46.4 +/- 1.71). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bp), probing depth (pd), and attachment level (al) were measured. subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and  fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. after 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. the sites were divided according to baseline pd values into: group 1 (5 mm), group 2 (6 mm) and group 3 (> or = 7 mm). results revealed a significant reduction in pi scores, gi scores, pb and pd in groups 2 and 3. no significant difference in al was observed in any of the three groups. pi scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and gi scores, bp and pd tended to decrease. a significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. at the end of the  study, a significant decrease in pi/n was found in all three groups. significant  decreases were found in pg and fn in groups 3 and 2 respectively. although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.

TI  == specific antibiotics in the treatment of periodontitis--a proposed strategy.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present study was to propose a strategy for the selection of antibiotics that specifically target complexes of periodontal pathogens present in patients with periodontitis. methods: seven hundred seventy-four (774) patients with various forms of periodontitis were included in  the study. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest periodontal pockets in each quadrant using a sterile curet, and pooled. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, tannerella  forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were identified by polymerase chain reaction, and the prevalence of combinations of these pathogens  was determined. to each pathogen complex (pc), i.e., combination of pathogens, those antibiotics were assigned that were most specific according to the published minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) concentrations achievable in vivo. antibiotic gcf concentrations had to be at least 10 times the mic90 values, and the narrowest spectrum was selected with respect to the assessed periodontal pathogens. results: nine major pcs (each > or = 3% of all patients) were found in 73.4% of all patients, whereas 38 minor pcs (each < 3% of all patients) were distributed in 26.6% of all patients. ten different antibiotic regimens were found to be specific for the total of 46 pcs; i.e., metronidazole and amoxicillin in 11 pcs (55.0% of all patients), metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in 13 pcs (18.9%), amoxicillin in 4 pcs (8.3%), doxycycline in 2 pcs (6.1%), metronidazole in 8 pcs (4.1%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 3 pcs (2.9%), clindamycin in 2 pcs (1.5%), ciprofloxacin in 2 pcs (0.4%), and tetracycline in 1 pc (0.3%). conclusion: the results of the study indicate that there are at least 46 different combinations of the assessed periodontal pathogens in subjects with periodontitis, and at least 10 different antibiotic regimens might be required to specifically target the various pathogen complexes.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

AB  == objective: to compare periodontal conditions in children with and without cleft.  design: clinical examinations and microbiological analysis of 57 selected children, including 30 with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (experimental group) and 27 without clefts (control group). setting: hospital of  rehabilitation of craniofacial anomalies (hrca) in bauru, sao paulo, brazil. patients, participants: all children examined were healthy and between the ages of 5 and 6 years. results: the mean plaque index (pi) in the experimental group was higher (1.82 +/- 0.3) than in the control group (1.63 +/- 0.38), although this difference was not statistically significant. the mean gingival index (gi) in the experimental group (1.82 +/- 0.38) was found to be significantly higher (p <.05) than that of the control group (0.79 +/- 0.33). the cleft area in the experimental group, with a mean pi of 2.04 +/- 0.58 and mean gi of 1.11 +/- 0.26, compared with the posterior area, with a mean pi of 1.74 +/- 0.37 and mean gi of  1.04 +/- 0.26, showed a statistically significant difference only in the pi. most of the children in both experimental and control groups presented a moderate pi degree (73.33% and 81.48%, respectively) and a high prevalence of mild gingivitis (53.33% and 70.37%, respectively). analysis of the organisms showed that prevotella nigrescens was detected in 16.67% of the experimental group and 11.11% of the control, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were not detected. conclusion: children with clefts showed greater gingival inflammation,  despite the same amount of plaque and prevalence of microorganisms.

TI  == effects of triclosan-containing rinse on the dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro plaque ecosystems.
AB  == dental plaque microcosms were established under a feast-famine regimen within constant-depth film fermentors and exposed four times daily postfeeding to a triclosan (tr)-containing rinse (dentifrice) (trd). this was diluted so that the  antimicrobial content was 0.6 mg/ml. microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with primers specific for the v2-v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rrna gene (rdna). dominant isolates and pcr amplicons were identified by partial sequencing of 16s rdna. trd caused considerable decreases in the counts of both gram-negative organisms and total anaerobic cells, transiently lowered the numbers of streptococci and actinomycetes, and markedly increased the proportion  of lactobacilli. dgge indicated the presence of putatively unculturable bacteria  and showed that a porphyromonas sp. and selenomonas infelix had been inhibited by trd. pure culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that neisseria subflava, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis were highly susceptible to tr, while the lactobacilli and streptococci were the least  susceptible. clonal expansion of the lactobacilli in the pulsed microcosm could be explained on the basis of tr activity. the mean mics of tr, chlorhexidine, erythromycin, penicillin v, and vancomycin for the population before and after 5  days of exposure to trd showed few significant changes. in conclusion, changes in plaque microcosm populations following repeated exposure to trd showed inhibition of the most susceptible flora and clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == the subgingival microflora in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia.
AB  == objectives: microbial flora and gingival conditions were compared between a group of patients with phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia as a test group, a control group of patients who were administered phenytoin without gingival hyperplasia and a blank group who took no phenytoin and no gingival hyperplasia in mentally retarded patients. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples  were collected from a pht-induced overgrown gingival pocket and microbiological experiments were performed by culture and pcr methods. results: the predominant genera in total cultivable bacteria from subgingival plaque samples were streptococcus and actinomyces with recovery ranges of 37.6-42.1% and 23.4-25.5% of total bacteria, respectively, in all groups. the test group showed a significantly higher level of obligate gram-negative rods than the control and blank groups. black-pigmented obligate anaerobic gram-negative rods were detected in 10.3% of total cultivable bacteria in the test group. the black-pigmented rods were predominantly prevotella intermedia in the test group and prevotella nigrescens in the control and blank groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis were also detected in the test group with small values. conclusions: these results suggested that black-pigmented rods, particularly p. intermedia, could be habitable in the environment of gingival hyperplasia.

TI  == the cell extract of porphyromonas gingivalis promotes attachment of prevotella nigrescens cells to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == large quantities of prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261 (p. nigrescens) cells adhere to hydroxyapatite (ha) treated with extract from porphyromonas gingivalis 381 (pg-ext), but not to ha coated with human serum albumin (hsa) or human serum globulin (hsg). the duration of ha treatment with pg-ext and several other conditions were tested to determine the factors causing pg-ext to promote p. nigrescens cell adhesion. pg-ext adsorbed rapidly to ha in less than 5 min. the maximum adherence of p. nigrescens cells to ha was observed after treatment of hsa and hsg and then retreatment of ha with pg-ext. it was found that pg-ext heated at 80 degrees c for 30 min did not lose its propensity to promote attachment of p. nigrescens to ha and that it also remained stable at 4 degrees c for at least 6 days. the trypsin-like enzyme activity of pg-ext was also measured, with bapna as the substrate and commercially purchased trypsin as the standard, and was approximately 0.12 units/mg. these data suggest that the presence of pg-ext is one of the essential factors responsible for p. nigrescens  cell attachment to apatitic surfaces, and that with its trypsin-like activity, pg-ext may be considered an extremely important substance for the establishment of p. nigrescens in the periodontal pocket and the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == the haem pigment of the oral anaerobes prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia is composed of iron(iii) protoporphyrin ix in the monomeric form.
AB  == the haem pigment of porphyromonas gingivalis is composed of micro -oxo bishaem, [fe(iii)ppix](2)o, but the nature of that generated by prevotella species has not been established. mossbauer, raman and uv-visible spectrophotometry were used to  characterize the haem pigment of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. mossbauer and raman spectroscopy revealed the major haem species to be monomeric  iron protoporphyrin ix, fe(iii)ppix.oh (haematin). the terminal growth ph of both species on blood agar was between 5.8 and 6.0, which favours the formation and maintenance of monomeric fe(iii)ppix.oh. incubation of pr. nigrescens and pr. intermedia with oxyhaemoglobin at ph 6.5 resulted in formation of aquomethaemoglobin which was degraded to generate fe(iii)ppix.oh which in turn became cell-associated, whilst incubation at ph 7.5 resulted in formation of [fe(iii)ppix](2)o. it is concluded that both prevotella species degrade oxyhaemoglobin to form [fe(iii)ppix](2)o as an intermediate, which is converted to fe(iii)ppix.oh through a depression in ph. the low ph encourages cell-surface  deposition of insoluble fe(iii)ppix.oh which would act as a barrier against oxygen and reactive oxygen species, and also protect against h(2)o(2) through its inherent catalase activity.

TI  == lethal photosensitization in microbiological treatment of ligature-induced peri-implantitis: a preliminary study in dogs.
AB  == this pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue o (tbo,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mw gaalas diode laser. the mean initial and final  bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 cfu/ml, respectively for tvc (p < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 cfu/ml for p. intermedia/nigrescens (p = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 cfu/ml for fusobacterium spp. (p = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 cfu/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (p = 0.0039). it may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.

TI  == microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of hiv-positive subjects with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == many putative periodontal pathogens associated with periodontal disease in human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients also occur in non-hiv-infected individuals. this study examined the prevalence of eight periodontal pathogens in hiv-positive and hiv-negative patients with chronic periodontitis using the 16s rna polymerase chain reaction technique. the results showed a significant prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola among hiv-negative patients compared to hiv-positive patients. sixty percent of the patients in both groups were colonized by five to six species. odds ratio analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between three of the 28 possible combinations in the hiv-positive group. they included prevotella nigrescens/campylobacter rectus, p. nigrescens/p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens/t. denticola. although the prevalence of periodontal pathogens is similar in both the groups, the combination of certain periodontal pathogens may be responsible for chronic periodontitis seen in hiv-infected adults.

TI  == inhibitory effects of green tea catechins on protein tyrosine phosphatase in prevotella intermedia.
AB  == members of the prevotella intermedia group possess protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptpase). the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of catechin derivatives from japanese green tea on the activity of ptpase in p. intermedia and related organisms. multilocus enzyme electrophoresis of alkaline phosphatase  derived from p. intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens and porphyromonas gingivalis revealed a species-specific migration pattern. among the tea catechin derivatives tested, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (egcg), similar to  orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor for ptpase, was effective in inhibiting the ptpase activity in p. intermedia at 0.5 microm, and related species at 5 microm.  the results suggested that the inhibitory effect observed is due to the presence  of galloyl moiety in the structure. in contrast, neither the green tea catechins  nor orthovanadate inhibited the phosphatase activity in p. gingivalis, suggesting that this organism possessed a different family of alkaline phosphatase.

TI  == accidentally induced periodontitis in primary dentition: longitudinal examinations of periodontal bacteria and clinical conditions.
AB  == periodontitis is very rare in the primary dentition although it can be accidentally induced in young children. the purpose of this study was to describe a case of periodontitis in a 4-year-old child, which was accidentally induced by  insertion of small plastic tubes into the dental cervix of the primary incisors during play, and to discuss the clinical, radiographic, and microbiological findings. removal of the plastic tubes resulted in resolution of the periodontal  condition. prevotella nigrescens and campylobacter rectus were detected in subgingival plaque samples from the affected teeth at every examination, whereas  porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides forsythus were never found during the two-year observation period. the clinical and microbiological results suggest that the type of periodontitis caused by such an incidence is not progressive, unlike other periodontal diseases such as prepubertal and juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial interactions in aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and herpesvirus co-infections occur with significantly higher frequency in actively progressing than in stable periodontitis sites of adolescents and young adults. also, periodontal presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus is associated with increased occurrence of subgingival porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, dialister pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. aim: this article reviews the evidence linking herpesviruses to the development of aggressive periodontitis and suggests a potential mechanism for herpesviral acceleration of  the periodontal disease process. conclusions: it seems to be a reasonable supposition that the etiopathogenesis of various types of aggressive periodontitis includes the combined action of herpesviruses and specific bacterial species. new vaccines and vaccination technologies that are being developed against herpesviruses warrant testing for their ability to induce a protective immune response against destructive periodontal disease. clearly, the  importance of combined herpesviral-bacterial infections and associated host responses in the development of periodontitis needs to be studied further.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival application of 25% metronidazole dental gel as an adjunct  to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of adult periodontitis. eighty teeth in 18 patients were evaluated using a split mouth design. the test teeth received srp and a 25% metronidazole gel applied subgingivally on days 0 and 7. the control teeth received srp only. clinical and microbiological examinations were carried out before treatment and on weeks 1, 3, 7, 13, 26, 38 and 52 of the  experimental period. colony forming units of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia / prevotella nigrescens were determined. both treatments provided significant improvements in all the clinical and microbiological parameters (p<0.05). however, none of the differences between the study groups were statistically significant (p > 0.05). as a conclusion, the present study does not provide evidence in favour of the routine use of adjunctive metronidazole dental gel in the treatment of adult periodontitis.

TI  == periodontopathogens in the saliva and subgingival dental plaque of a group of mothers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the periodontal condition and the presence of putative periodontal pathogens in 30 brazilian mothers, aging 21-40 years (28.4 4.49 years), and in their children, aging 5-6 years, since mothers can be a source of pathogens and, thus, influence their children's bacteriological and clinical condition. besides assessing the plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi)  and pocket probing depth (pd), the survey analyzed four subgingival dental plaque samples from mothers and children, as well as a sample of stimulated saliva from  mothers. those samples were analyzed by means of the slot immunoblot (sib) technique, in order to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella nigrescens (pn), porphyromonas gingivalis  (pg) and treponema denticola (td). the mean values and standard deviations of the evaluated clinical variables for mothers and children were, respectively: 1.86 0.67 and 1.64 0.68 for pi, and 1.24 0.67 and 0.82 0.37, for gi. only for mothers, the total pd was 1.81 0.69 mm, and the pd of four sites was 4.03 1.40 mm. the wilcoxon test revealed significant difference (p < 0.05) between mothers and their children only as to gi. the most prevalent bacteria in mothers were, in decreasing order: aa, pn, pg and td. the children presented patterns of oral hygiene and bacterial profiles similar to those of their mothers, in spite of the fact that most of them did not present enough subgingival plaque for testing. the comparison between mothers' subgingival dental plaque and saliva samples revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) for all bacteria, with greater positivity and scores in the saliva, which demonstrates that it is an indicator of oral colonization and can work as a vehicle for the transmission of periodontopathogens from mothers to their children.

TI  == microbiota around root-form endosseous implants: a review of the literature.
AB  == although high success rates for root-form endosseous implants have been reported, failures occasionally occur, and these implants must be removed. at least 10% of  the failures have been suggested to be the result of peri-implantitis. there is some evidence that periodontal pathogens, mainly those belonging to the group of  gram-negative anaerobic rods, play a role in the etiology of peri-implantitis. this article provides an overview of the literature associated with common peri-implant microbiology and an assessment as to whether bacteria associated with periodontitis exert a possible risk for peri-implant tissue breakdown. the peri-implant area is colonized by a large variety of oral microbial complexes. the microflora of the oral cavity prior to implant placement determines the composition of the microflora in the peri-implant area. implants involved in peri-implantitis are colonized with large amounts of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, including fusobacteria, spirochetes, bacteroides forsythus, and "black-pigmented bacteria" such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and porphyromonas gingivalis. also, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be isolated from these lesions. thus, the microflora of peri-implantitis lesions resembles that of adult or refractory periodontitis. however, the presence of periodontal pathogens does not always lead to a destructive process. therefore, the etiologic role of specific microorganisms in implant failure related to infection is still not resolved. controversy remains as to whether organisms recovered from the original microflora cause the failure (and if so to what extent) or merely result from the infection. nevertheless, there is accumulating  evidence that bacteria cause the disease, while the individual's genetic makeup and environmental influences determine the severity of the disease.

TI  == presence and antibiotic resistance of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens in children.
AB  == background/aims: only limited information exists about the prevalence in children of pathogens associated with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to determine by culture whether 8-11-year-old children carry porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and/or p. nigrescens in samples from the gingiva and/or the buccal mucosa taken before, and after caries treatment and oral hygiene instruction. a second aim was to assess the proportion of subjects who had gram-negative anaerobes carrying the tet(q) and erm(f) genes, suggesting  antibiotic resistance to tetracycline or erythromycin. method: a total of 150 children provided gingival and buccal swab bacterial samples that were cultured for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and p. nigrescens. the species was verified using dna-dna hybridization with species-specific probes made from the variable region of the 16s rrna sequences. antibiotic-resistant genes, tet(q) and erm(f),  were identified using specific dna-dna hybridization with specific dna probes. results: a total of 116 isolates of black-pigmented bacteria were cultured from 47 (31%) of 150 children. five isolates were identified as p. gingivalis, 29 as p. intermedia, 33 as p. nigrescens, and 49 as other species. in general, the bacteria were not culturable at more than one time period. we found that 55% of these 47 children harbored black pigmented bacteria that carried either one or both of the two antibiotic-resistant genes studied (tet(q), and erm(f)). conclusion: the present study demonstrated that children not exposed to regular dental treatment carry bacteria outside the gingival sulcus that have been associated with periodontitis, and that standard treatment procedures may not clear the presence of the putative pathogens. in addition, antibiotic-resistant genes are common in identifiable gram-negative anaerobes, including putative pathogens.

TI  == frequency of reactivity for porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp. in supra- and subgingival plaques, and periodontal clinical parameters according to  subject age.
AB  == background: the present study was conducted to assess the association between selected clinical parameters and the distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and prevotella melaninogenica (pm) in supra- and subgingival plaque samples measured by an immunoslot blot assay (iba) using their monoclonal antibodies. methods: plaque samples from 299 patients aged 6 to 69 randomly chosen from a group of dental outpatients were examined. plaque index, gingival index, and probing depths were  evaluated according to the criteria of positive (cell number > or = 10(6)) or negative (<106) reactivity to the 4 different monoclonal antibodies. results: an  increase in probing depth in subjects exhibiting either a positive or negative reaction for the 4 test bacteria was associated with increasing age. comparing bacteria-positive subgingival plaque samples to their corresponding bacteria-negative counterparts, we found an increased plaque index in children positive for any of the 4 bacteria; in addition, that for pg and pi was increased in subjects 40 to 49 years old. the gingival index increased with increasing amount of pi and pn, but not with pg and pm in those 20 to 29 years of age. the frequency of pg reactivity in subgingival plaque was markedly enhanced in subjects older than 30 to 39 years of age, and was significantly higher than that in supragingival plaque. the frequency of pi and pn reactivity was significantly  increased in adults aged 20 to 29 and plateaued at older ages. the frequency of pm reactivity was relatively low and independent of subject age. conclusions: the increase in probing depth with increasing age was not affected by the occurrence  of periodontopathic bacteria. the high rate of occurrence of pg, together with pi and pn, in subgingival plaque of the adult age groups was suggested to be associated with the high frequency of periodontal disease in the older age groups (above 30 to 49 years of age). the iba appears to be useful for the efficient and rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  == the microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (hla) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who  were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases,  associated with hematological disorders'. examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (dqb1) and serotypes (dr locus) of hla class ii antigens. phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted.  the subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by gram-negative rods, especially porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum. subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods. through the use of polymerase chain reaction, campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, and treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. all three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. each subject had the same genotype, hla-dqb1*0601, while the mother had hla-dr2 and hla-dr8, and the son and daughter had hla-dr2 only. in summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. it is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis clinical strains reveals a clear species clustering.
AB  == prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis are oral pathogens from the family bacteroidaceae, regularly isolated from cases of gingivitis and periodontitis. in this study, the phylogenetic variability of these three bacterial species was investigated by means of 16s rrna (rrs) gene sequence comparisons of a set of epidemiologically and geographically diverse isolates. for each of the three species, the rrs gene sequences of 11 clinical isolates as well as the corresponding type strains was determined. comparison of  all rrs sequences obtained with those of closely related species revealed a clear clustering of species, with only a little intraspecies variability but a clear difference in the rrs gene with respect to the next related taxon. the results indicate that the three species form stable, homogeneous genetic groups, which favours an rrs-based species identification of these oral pathogens. this is especially useful given the 7% sequence divergence between prevotella intermedia  and prevotella nigrescens, since phenotypic distinction between the two prevotella species is inconsistent or involves techniques not applicable in routine identification.

AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == direct quantitative differentiation between prevotella intermedia and prevotella  nigrescens in clinical specimens.
AB  == this paper describes a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the differential identification of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in clinical samples, and compares its performance with less discriminatory culture and quantitative immunofluorescence (if) assays. fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16s rrna sequences of p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, prevotella pallens and prevotella denticola were hybridized under stringent conditions with cultured reference strains or plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets. probe specificity was defined with strains from multiple oral prevotella species. the lower detection level of the assays was approximately 3x10(3) target cells per ml of plaque-sample suspension. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. pallens and p. denticola were detected in plaques with prevalences of 69, 67, 0 and 28%, respectively. on average, 3.9 x 10(6) p. intermedia, 3.1 x 10(6) p. nigrescens and 5.6 x 10(5) p. denticola cells were counted per positive sample. all three species were found almost exclusively in dense mixed aggregates. quantitative fish data agreed satisfactorily with corresponding if data (r=0.711). both fish and if enumerations of the sum of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens markedly exceeded the c.f.u. counts of black-pigmented colonies in porphyromonas gingivalis-free cultured subgingival plaques. the results demonstrate the validity of this new assay. unlike established if, culture, pcr or checkerboard dna hybridization assays, this fish assay differentiates quantitatively between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, provides visual accuracy control, and offers insights into the spatial distribution of the target cells within a clinical sample.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of periodontopathic bacteria dna in the granulation tissue of periodontally involved gingival tissue. forty periodontitis patients were examined. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from the patients before surgery. then, granulation tissue was also collected during surgery. another 20 patients, who had more than 4 mm in probing pocket depth, were also examined as a control. they received only initial treatment without periodontal surgery. plaque and saliva samples were also collected from them. seven periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, toreponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, were detected by a pcr method from these samples of all patients. as clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing were recorded. one year after surgery, sampling of subgingival plaque and saliva, and measurement of clinical parameters were performed on the patients. the dna of periodontopathic bacteria was detected in the granulation tissue of 29 out of 40 patients. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected in 23, 11, 12, 9, 3, 2 and 1 subject(s) respectively. the sites with undetectable level of any periodontal pathogens at one year after surgery showed a clinical attachment  gain of 2.44 mm, while those that showed detectable pathogen levels had only a 0.77 mm gain. our results indicated that the removal of granulation tissue contributed to eliminating periodontal pathogens and to avoiding re-infection by  those bacteria. complete eradication of periodontopathic bacteria would be necessary for successful periodontal treatment.

TI  == distribution of erm(f) and tet(q) genes in 4 oral bacterial species and genotypic variation between resistant and susceptible isolates.
AB  == background: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia are gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that are currently considered potential periopathogens. prevotella nigrescens has recently been separated from  p. intermedia and its role in periodontitis is unknown. the erm(f) gene codes for an rrna methylase, conferring resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b (mlsb), and the tet(q) gene for a ribosomal protection protein, conferring resistance to tetracycline. the presence of these resistance genes could impair the use of antibiotics for therapy. purpose: the aim of this study was to determine the carriage of erm(f) and tet(q), and genetic variability of 12 porphyromonas gingivalis, 10 prevotella intermedia, 25 prevotella nigrescens and  17 bacteroides forsythus isolates from 9 different patient samples. methods: we used polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for detecting antibiotic resistance genes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for detecting genetic variability among the isolates. results: thirty-one (48%) isolates were resistant to both erythromycin and tetracycline and carried the erm(f) and tet(q) genes, eight (13%) were tetracycline resistant and carried the tet(q) gene, 9 (14%) were erythromycin resistant and carried the erm(f) gene, and 12 (19%) isolates did not carry antibiotic resistance genes. pfge was used to compare isolates from the same patient and isolates from different patient samples digested with xbai. no association was found between antibiotic resistance gene carriage and pfge patterns in any species examined. all isolates of the same species from the same  patient had highly related or identical pfge patterns. isolates of same species from different patients had unique pfge pattern for each species tested. conclusion: all isolates of the same species from any one patient were genetically related to each other but distinct from isolates from other patients, and 66% of the patients carried antibiotic resistant isolates, which could impair antibiotic therapy.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == dipeptide utilization by the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum, which can frequently be isolated from periodontal pockets, preferentially utilize proteins and peptides as growth substrates. in this study, we determined the size of peptide that is preferentially utilized as  a source of energy and material for cell growth by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia,  p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum using various sizes of poly amino acids consisting of two to approximately 100 molecules of aspartate or glutamate. resting cells of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens utilized aspartylaspartate, while  cells of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum utilized glutamylglutamate. the addition  of aspartylaspartate to the culture medium increased the growth of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, while the addition of glutamylglutamate promoted the growth of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. these results clearly indicate that dipeptides such as aspartylaspartate and glutamylglutamate can be utilized as growth substrates for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == one-year compliance and effects of amine and stannous fluoride on some salivary biochemical constituents and oral microbes in institutionalized elderly.
AB  == due to old age and poor general health, the institutionalized elderly have often  not been used as research subjects for the investigation of oral health protocols. because the number of elderly is increasing, they are an important target group for the development of oral hygiene aids. this trial was designed to investigate whether the institutionalized elderly could successfully use an amine-fluoride- and stannous-fluoride-containing mouthwash and toothpaste during  a 12-month period. a dental hygienist visited the subjects weekly, instructed them, and recorded their self-reported compliance. plaque and saliva samples were taken at three-month intervals. some salivary biochemical constituents reflecting mucosal integrity were analyzed. the carrier status of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens was studied by the polymerase chain-reaction method, and acidogenic bacteria and yeasts by dip-slide methods (orion diagnostica, espoo, finland). of those 98 subjects originally included, 44 elderly (30 women and 14 men; mean age, 81.7 +/- 5.9 yrs) completed the trial. their observations were positive or very positive regarding the use of mouthwash  and toothpaste. the number of residents with p. gingivalis decreased statistically significantly throughout the trial, while the carrier status of the other periodontal bacteria and mutans streptococci remained on the same level. the number of subjects with high counts (> or = 10(5) cfu/ml) of yeasts decreased during the study: 26.2% at baseline, 9.1% one year later, respectively. biochemical analyses of salivary immunoglobulins showed no effect on iga and igm  levels, but igg reduced significantly. albumin and other salivary protein concentrations were found to have a decreasing tendency. thus, the overall effect of the protocol was beneficial with regard to subjects' oral health as measured in this study. the residents were pleased to participate, but the number of drop-outs was very high, confirming the expected difficulties with the utilization of a group of frail elderly as research subjects.

TI  == effects of glucose on formation of cytotoxic end-products and proteolytic activity of prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == black-pigmented bacteria which produce cytotoxic metabolic end-products and cell  membrane-associated proteases have been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. these bacterial virulence factors can be modified by the environmental conditions including nutrients supplied variously into the oral cavity. although glucose is one of the most essential nutrients for oral bacteria, the exogenous supply of glucose may be discontinuous and the glucose concentration in a periodontal pocket may be influenced by the depth of the periodontal pocket. therefore, effects of glucose as an environmental factor  on the virulence factors of prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and porphyromonas in the presence o glucose.,bo t p. intermedia and p. nigrescens markedly decreased the production of cytotoxic end-products including succinate.,isobutyrate,isovalerate and ammonia, although their growth was increased. furthermore, the proteolytic activities such as immunoglobulin- albumin- and casein-degrading activities of these bacteria were decreased in the  presence of glucose. on the other hand, no effect of glucose on the metabolic activity of p gingivalis was observed. these results suggest that pathogenicity of p. intermedia p. nigrescens may be decreased by the presence of glucose.

TI  == [effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and periodontal tissues].
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate, clinically and microbiologically, forty-four sites in 11 patients presenting with generalized chronic periodontitis. plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), probing bleeding (pb), probing depth (pd) and insertion level (il) were registered. samples of subgingival plaque were collected in the same sites for cultivation of anaerobic  bacteria and determination of microbiological morphotypes using dark field microscopy. clinical and microbiological data were recorded on the baseline and 4 weeks after the adoption of a program to control supragingival plaque and calculus. the microbiological analysis categorized the degree of development as follows: 0--not detected, 1--scarce, 2--moderate and 3--abundant. the clinical results at the baseline and on the 28th day were, respectively: pi--1.73 +/- 0.10 and 0.30 +/- 0.08; gi--1.73 +/- 0.08 and 1.41 +/- 0.08; pb--0.91 +/- 0.04 and 0.59 +/- 0.07; pd--6.43 +/- 0.20 and 5.77 +/- 0.25; and il--6.86 +/- 0.32 and 6.52 +/- 0.34. there was significant decrease in pi, gi, pb and pd. however, the  difference in il was not significant. the relative proportions of the microbial morphotypes observed under dark field microscopy at the baseline and on the 28th  day were, respectively: coccoid cells--21.16 +/- 3.77 and 36.00 +/- 4.66; mobile  bacillus--44.86 +/- 2.65 and 39.50 +/- 2.64; and total treponemes--24.66 +/- 3.08 and 19.25 +/- 2.75. the cultures presented, at the baseline and on the 28th day,  respectively: prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n)--1.36 +/- 0.18 and 0.43 +/- 0.11; porphyromonas gingivalis--0.48 +/- 0.16 and 0.32 +/- 0.13; actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans--0.23 +/- 0.09 and 0.23 +/- 0.10; fusobacterium nucleatum--0.32 +/- 0.14 and 0.41 +/- 0.13; and peptostreptococci--0.82 +/- 0.19  and 0.54 +/- 0.16. there was a significant increase in the number of coccoid cells and a decrease in the number of treponemes and pi/n.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. study design: pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16s  rrna gene primers. results: the results of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 dna probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. the number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one dna probe. the most prevalent species found were: bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), prevotella intermedia (22.2%), prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and  eikenella corrodens (18.5%). conclusions: the microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting  bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.

AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. a total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy  sites were selected according to clinical criteria. the following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. in disease sites the most frequently isolated were: prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). the aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes  26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. the presence of motile rods, spirochetes and p. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. there were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. in 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic  evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline hcl-containing fibers. clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (m) after treatment. standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, m3, and one  year after treatment. two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. the remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (m1, p<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. in comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (p<0.001). no significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. the radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. at m1, m3 and m6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (p<0.001).  a significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium sp., bacteroides forsythus, and campylobacter rectus (p<0.01). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. in conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.

TI  == on the symmetry of periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aim: symmetry is a common feature of biological systems, and can be observed in multiple aspects of the human body. the purpose of this study was to  estimate the impact of symmetry on variance observed in intraoral topographic distribution patterns of chronic periodontitis. method: this analysis was performed on a data set from 56 subjects, including clinical and microbiological  variables, recorded at the mesial and distal aspect of every tooth in the entire  dentition. the impact of contralateral conditions was determined on the level of  the site, the tooth, and the quadrant. results: significant correlations were detected between probing depths, recession, attachment levels, total cultivable bacterial counts and the plaque index recorded on the right and left side on all  levels of analysis. the odds for bleeding on sampling, as well as for the presence of p. intermedia/nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans increased significantly if the respective contralateral site was positive for the same parameter. in combining ipsilateral and contralateral parameters into the analysis it could be shown in several instances that this contralateral effect was stronger than the impact of other, ipsilateral factors. as an example, the odds for bleeding on sampling increased up to 10 fold if the contralateral site was bleeding, whereas the ipsilateral total cultivable count, determined at the same site, explained less than 30% of the variation in the bleeding tendency. conclusion: these findings support the view that the development of periodontal disease in any site cannot be explained by the influence of local detrimental factors alone.

AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == inhibition of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxicity by bacteria from the subgingival flora.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a pore-forming leukotoxin that lyses human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. certain proteolytic bacteria may coexist with a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets. we aimed therefore to examine whether oral bacteria can modify the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans. a total of 55 strains representing 45 bacterial species of the subgingival flora were tested. each strain was incubated with the highly toxic strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans hk 1519 and the leukotoxic activity of the suspension against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined from the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase released upon lysis of the leukocytes. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella loeschii inhibited the leukotoxicity of  a. actinomycetemcomitans cells as well as the activity of leukotoxin purified from the same strain. the bacterial strains without the ability to block leukotoxic activity also failed to destroy pure leukotoxin even after 5 h of incubation. the proteolytic degradation of leukotoxin by p. gingivalis was mainly dependent on the activity of the enzymes r- and k-gingipains. p. intermedia and p. nigrescens also degraded the leukotoxin by enzymes. the results imply a role of the periodontal microflora in modifying the virulence of a. actinomycetemcomitans by destroying its leukotoxin.

TI  == measurement of proteases in human subgingival dental plaque by fluorescence polarization.
AB  == fluorescence polarization (fp) was examined as a rapid quantitative method to assay the proteases in subgingival plaque. protease activity was measured by a decrease in fp at 0.5-min intervals over 5 min, using bodipy-alpha-casein, a protein substrate. to quantitate activity, the least absolute deviation (lad) slope for each assay was determined. protease activity increased with the quantity of plaque (r=0.416, p<0.001). of the 208 subgingival plaque samples, 87  contained detectable protease activity, with a mean of about 4 microg trypsin equivalents above a general background of 1 microg per site. the mean plaque protease activity of 89 paired samples from 15 individuals had decreased by 1.1 microg trypsin equivalents per site when measured at 8 months after tooth scaling and root planing (p<0.01). most isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia implicated in the pathogenesis of adult periodontitis exhibited high activity in the fp assay. the  assay is rapid, quantitative and requires only one-tenth of the plaque sampled using a single pass with a gracey curette at a single tooth site.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

AB  == the primary objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and to evaluate the microbial differences between localized and generalized forms of this periodontal disease condition. thirty-one females and 11 males with a mean age of 30.3 (s.d. 4.0) years were examined. seventeen subjects had generalized (geop) and 25 had localized early-onset periodontitis (leop). subgingival plaque samples were assayed using pcr which provided subject prevalence data for the pathogens; bacteroides forsythus 78.6%, treponema denticola 88.1%, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 19.0%, porphyromonas gingivalis 16.7%, prevotella intermedia 40.4%, prevotella nigrescens 61.9%, eikenella corrodens 42.3% and campylobacter rectus 92.8%. only 3 healthy sites harbored one or more of these periodontal pathogens. seven of the 8 subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans had leop. p. intermedia was present in 58.8% of geop compared with 28% of leop subjects (p=0.046). at 82.4% of geop sites p. nigrescens was present while this bacteria was detected at 52% of leop (p=0.044). p. gingivalis was isolated from 22.6% of females but no male subjects  (p=0.084). c. rectus was recovered from all female subjects compared to 72.7% of  males (p=0.014). a. actinomycetemcomitans (37.5%) and c. rectus (86.5%) were more frequently identified in non-smokers compared to 7.6% and 68.8% of smokers, respectively (p <0.05). microbial associations coincided with the clinical division of the cases into leop and geop in 83% of the subjects.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum involvement in adult periodontitis and possible modification of strain classification.
AB  == background: this investigation was designed to evaluate the involvement of fusobacterium nucleatum clinical strains in adult periodontitis by subspecies and expression of hemagglutination activity. methods: forty-nine fusobacterium strains were isolated from 40 sites in 40 subjects presenting with adult periodontitis. f. nucleatum subspecies identification was based on the electrophoretic migration of glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase. hemagglutination activity and inhibition by galactose were tested on sheep erythrocytes. results: the 49 isolates belonged to the f. nucleatum species with a predominance of the nucleatum (34.7%) followed by the vincentii (26.5%) subspecies. in parallel, 71% of the strains belonging to the nucleatum subspecies were preferentially associated with porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia/nigrescens detection was essentially correlated with identification of fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies vincentii. no correlation was established between any particular subspecies and the pathogenicity factors tested (hemagglutination and production of short-chain fatty acids). on the other hand,  significant predominance (65%, p= 0.017) of strongly hemagglutinating strains (titre > or =8 u) was observed in the sites where porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and/or campylobacter rectus were not detected. these strains also showed higher butyric acid production. conclusion: the importance of the adherence factors for fusobacterium nucleatum strains and their multimodal aspect may indicate a higher pathogenicity or a higher involvement of  certain strains and could lead to a classification of these strains, which is more closely related to their implication in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to examine the short-term effect of apically repositioned flap surgery on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with adult periodontitis. a total of 11 patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis received apically repositioned flap surgery. subjects were monitored during a 3-month pretreatment phase, the baseline surgical phase, and for 3 months post-surgery. clinical assessments including plaque accumulation, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment  level were made at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from  the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 29 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and percentage of sites colonized by each species  (prevalence) were computed for each subject at each visit. after surgery, there was a significant decrease in mean pocket depth and percentage of sites exhibiting gingival redness. significant decreases were seen in the percentage of sites that had attachment levels < 4 mm, with a significant increase in the percentage of sites with attachment levels of 4 to 6 mm after therapy. the mean total dna probe count for all bacterial species was significantly decreased by both scaling and root planing and surgical therapy. p gingivalis and b forsythus, 2 bacteria previously shown to be susceptible to mechanical therapy, exhibited statistically significant decreases in mean total dna probe count. because surgical therapy decreased levels of the suspected periodontal pathogens c rectus, p nigrescens, and c gracilis, it may be speculated that there was a potential added beneficial effect of surgery on the periodontal microbiota.

TI  == herpesviruses in human periodontal disease.
AB  == recent studies have identified various herpesviruses in human periodontal disease. epstein-barr virus type 1 (ebv-1) infects periodontal b-lymphocytes and  human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infects periodontal monocytes/ macrophages and t-lymphocytes. ebv-1, hcmv and other herpesviruses are present more frequently in periodontitis lesions and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis-lesions than in gingivitis or periodontally healthy sites. reactivation of hcmv in periodontitis  lesions tends to be associated with progressing periodontal disease. herpesvirus-associated periodontitis lesions harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteriodes forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola. it may be that active periodontal  herpesvirus infection impairs periodontal defenses, thereby permitting subgingival overgrowth of periodontopathic bacteria. alteration between latent and active herpesvirus infection in the periodontium might lead to transient local immunosuppression and explain in part the episodic progressive nature of human periodontitis. tissue tropism of herpesvirus infections might help explain  the localized pattern of tissue destruction in periodontitis. absence of herpesvirus infection or viral reactivation might explain why some individuals carry periodontopathic bacteria while still maintaining periodontal health. further studies are warranted to delineate whether the proposed herpesvirus-periodontopathic bacteria model might account for some of the pathogenic features of human periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == persistence patterns of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, and actinobacillus actinomyetemcomitans after mechanical therapy of periodontal disease.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the distribution patterns of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in periodontitis patients after standard mechanical periodontal therapy, and to determine factors increasing the odds to detect these target organisms in treated sites. methods: eight hundred fifty-two (852) separate subgingival microbial samples were taken from the mesial and distal aspects of every tooth in 17 patients. target organisms were identified culturally. results: the 3 microorganisms showed different persistence patterns:  p. gingivalis was detected in a high percentage of subjects (59%), but in a low proportion of sites (5.4%). p. intermedia/nigrescens was detected in all subjects except one, and in 40.6% of the tested sites. only 5 subjects were a. actinomycetemcomitans positive, but 2 of them showed a very high number of positive sites (44% and 75%, respectively). a highly significant relationship was found between a subject's tendency to bleed upon sampling and the number of p. intermedia/nigrescens-positive sites. a significant portion of the variation in frequency of persisting p. gingivalis could be explained by the frequency of persisting pockets deeper than 4 mm. no similar relationship could be established between clinical parameters and a. actinomycetemcomitans. on a site level, the odds of detecting p. gingivalis increased by a factor of 2.47 (p= 0.0001) for every millimeter of residual probing depth; the odds of detecting p. intermedia/nigrescens increased by a factor of 1.84 (p= 0.0001). conclusions: if, after standard mechanical periodontal therapy, a large number of sites continue to bleed, one may expect an increased number of sites positive for p. intermedia/ nigrescens. if many deep pockets persist, a greater number of p. gingivalis-positive sites can be expected.

TI  == survey for collagenase gene prtc in porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis isolated from endodontic infections.
AB  == collagenase is a potential virulence factor shown to be expressed by porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to use the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect the presence of the collagenase gene (prtc) in 21 strains of porphyromonas species isolated from  endodontic infections. type strains for p. gingivalis (atcc 33277), p. endodontalis (atcc 35406), prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611), and prevotella nigrescens (atcc 33563) were used as controls. when pcr primers specific for the  16s ribosomal rna gene of p. gingivalis or p. endodontalis were used, 16 of the strains were identified as p. gingivalis, and five strains were identified as p.  endodontalis. the presence of the prtc gene for collagenase was detected using pcr. amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with an 815 bp amplicon representing the presence of the collagenase gene. type strain atcc 33277 and all 16 clinical isolates of p. gingivalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. neither type strain atcc 35406 nor the five strains from clinical isolates of p. endodontalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. these results indicate that p. gingivalis from endodontic infections possesses the prtc gene. p. endodontalis does not seem to exhibit prtc. the virulence of p. gingivalis may be related to its production of collagenase.

TI  == identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  == gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. the confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular  species within this group of organisms. this investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. forty-three reference strains  of 19 prevotella and porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. the phenotypic screen easily differentiated porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. the screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to  species level with the kits. neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens. with the pcr method, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and porph. gingivalis was readily identified. because of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, pr. melaninogenica and pr. veroralis could not be separated by the pcr method.

TI  == possible potentiation of toxins from prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis by cotinine.
AB  == background: smoking is a recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of periodontitis. however, the mechanism by which smoking induces its negative effects on the periodontium is not clear. this study aimed to test the hypothesis that synergy may occur between cotinine and bacterial products isolated from 3 putative periodontopathogens. methods: a chick embryo toxin assay was used to investigate bacterial toxins (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell-free cell lysates) from 5 species with and without cotinine. a total of 9 putative periodontopathogens (3 species) and 2 non-oral controls (2 species) were studied. the periodontal species were: prevotella intermedia (n = 4), prevotella  nigrescens (n = 4), and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1). the control species tested were: staphylococcus aureus (n = 1) and escherichia coli (n = 1). results: the toxicity kill was significantly greater than expected by simple addition alone (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) between cotinine (800 ng/ml) and 1) the cell-free extracellular toxins of p. nigrescens mh1 and 2) the cell-free cell lysates of p. intermedia mh2. synergy occurred with cotinine plus the cell-free extracellular toxins in all but 3 periodontal isolates, and the cell-free cell lysates in all but 2 periodontal isolates. cotinine significantly (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) enhanced the effects of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates from one control species (e. coli), but not the other (s. aureus). conclusions: these findings indicate that synergy in an in vitro assay can occur  between cotinine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens. this may be one important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontitis.

TI  == microbial findings at failing implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate qualitative differences in the subgingival  microbiota at titanium implants, ad modum branemark, demonstrating clinical and radiographic signs of loss of supporting tissues (peri-implantitis) as compared to implants surrounded by healthy tissues. a total of 37 patients demonstrating 1 or more implants with bone loss > or = 3 threads, bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and 51 patients with clinically healthy mucosa and no bone loss were  recruited for the study. in each patient subgingival bacterial samples were obtained using paper-points, and subjected to microbiological analysis by culture. the two types of clinical conditions showed distinct bacterial profiles. for implants with peri-implantitis putative periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were found in 60% of the cases and microorganisms primarily not associated with periodontitis, such as staphylococcus spp., enterics and candida spp., were found in 55% of the peri-imaplant lesions. in contrast, implants surrounded by healthy tissue demonstrated a microbiota associated with periodontal health. the results indicate that the microbiota of the healthy peri-implant sulci is similar to that from corresponding conditions around teeth. however, in peri-implant areas staphylococci, enterics and yeasts were found almost as frequently as periopathogens indicating differences as compared to the microbiota around periodontitis affected teeth. a microbiological diagnosis may therefore be of guidance for the choice of antimicrobial treatment in patients with peri-implant  infection.

AB  == black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) have been associated with endodontic infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate further the presence of bpb with the clinical signs and symptoms associated with endodontic infections. microbial samples were collected from the root canals of 40 intact teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis. conventional laboratory methods were used for identification of the strains of bpb isolated in pure culture. in addition, the polymerase chain reaction and specific primers for 16s r-rna genes were used to differentiate prevotella nigrescens from prevotella intermedia. twenty-two (55%)  samples were positive for the growth of bpb. of those, 11 of 22 (50%) were identified as p. nigrescens, 8 of 22 (36%) were p. intermedia, 2 of 22 (9%) were  porphyromonas gingivalis, and 1 of 22 (5%) was prevotella melaninogenica. sixteen of the 22 root canals positive for the growth of bpb were associated with purulent drainage either from the root canal or an associated sinus tract. statistical analysis did not show a significant relationship for the presence of  bpb with clinical signs and symptoms.

AB  == aim: this study determined the frequency of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in 20 closed periapical lesions associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic refractory endodontic disease. methodology: to deliniate possible oral sources of p. endodontalis, the presence of the organism was assessed in selected subgingival sites and saliva in the same study patients. periapical samples were obtained by  paper points during surgical endodontic procedures using methods designed to minimize contamination by non-endodontic microorganisms. subgingival plaque samples were obtained by paper points from three periodontal pockets and from the pocket of the tooth associated with the closed periapical lesion. unstimulated saliva was collected from the surface of the soft palate. bacterial identification was performed using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method. results: p. endodontalis was not identified in any periapical lesion, even though subgingival samples from eight patients (40%) revealed the p. endodontalis-specific amplicon. p. gingivalis occurred in one periapical lesion that was associated with moderate pain. p. nigrescens, p. endodontalis and p. intermedia were not detected in any periapical lesion studied. conclusions: black-pigmented anaerobic rods appear to be infrequent inhabitants of the closed periapical lesion.

AB  == clinical samples from 10 infected root canals and from subgingival plaque in 10 patients were screened by anaerobic culture for black-pigmented anaerobes. a total of 17 porphyromonas gingivalis and 9 prevotella nigrescens were obtained from four patients and were identified by species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. the arbitrarily primed pcr reaction used to examine the genetic diversity of the isolates revealed that the p. gingivalis or p. nigrescens simultaneously present in the root canal system and in subgingival plaque of all four patients were genotypically indistinguishable. these data indicate that the endodontium and the periodontium can be colonized by the same clonal types of black-pigmented anaerobes.

TI  == microbiological features of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

TI  == relationship between herpesviruses and adult periodontitis and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background: various mammalian viruses and specific bacteria seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis. this study examined the relationship between subgingival herpesviruses and periodontal disease and potential periodontopathic bacteria in 140 adults exhibiting either periodontitis or gingivitis. methods: a nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method determined the presence of epstein-barr virus type 1 and type 2 (ebv-1, ebv-2), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and herpes simplex virus (hsv) and a 16s rrna pcr detection method identified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and treponema denticola. results: using a logistic analysis, ebv-1 showed significant positive association with p. gingivalis (odds ratio [or] 3.37), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia (or 4.03); p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 3.84); p. gingivalis and t. denticola (or 4.17); p. gingivalis,  b. forsythus, and t. denticola (or 4.06); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 3.29). ebv-1 also showed positive association with severe periodontitis (or 5.09), with increasing age (or 1.03), and with periodontal probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.77). hcmv was positively associated with  coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t.  denticola (or 2.59); with severe periodontitis (or 4.65); and with age (or 1.03). patients with mixed viral infections revealed significant associations with p. gingivalis (or 2.27), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 2.06); p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 2.70) with the clinical diagnosis of slight (or 3.73), moderate (or 3.82), or severe periodontitis (or 4.36), and with probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.39). hsv and ebv-2 showed no significant associations with any of the variables tested. conclusions: the results indicate that subgingival ebv-1, hcmv, and viral coinfections are associated with the subgingival presence of some periodontal pathogens and periodontitis. herpesviruses may exert periodontopathic potential by decreasing the host resistance against subgingival colonization and multiplication of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == modulation of antibacterial peptide activity by products of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp.
AB  == this study investigated the ability of anaerobic periodontal bacteria to inactivate and resist killing by antimicrobial peptides through production of extracellular proteases. antibacterial activities of peptides were assessed in a  double-layer agarose diffusion assay, and mics and mbcs were determined in broth  microdilution assays. culture supernates of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp. inactivated mastoparan, magainin ii and cecropin b whilst gram-positive oral supragingival bacteria had no effect. inactivation was prevented by protease inhibitors and was unaffected by 45% human serum. purified  proteases from the periodontopathogen porph. gingivalis inactivated peptides [cecropin b, brevinin, camel (cecropin a 1-7 + melittin 2-9), mastoparan] as would be predicted from the amino acid sequences of the peptides and the known bond specificities of these arg-x and lys-x enzymes. maldi-tof ms revealed that inactivation of cecropin b by porph. gingivalis protease was due to specific cleavage of the molecule. inactivation of cecropin b by proteases took 10-15 min. paradoxically, mics of cecropin b against porph. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were low, while prevotella nigrescens was resistant, suggesting that production of proteases alone is insufficient to protect porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia from the action of antimicrobial peptides. thus, antimicrobial peptides could be developed as therapeutic agents targeted against specific periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

AB  == the production of and sensitivity to bacteriocin-like activity among 44 strains of black-pigmented anaerobes isolated from periodontal sites were evaluated by both an overlay and an agar diffusion method. the species studied were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and the closely related species pr. nigrescens. pr. intermedia strains (90%) produced bacteriocin-like activity against pr. nigrescens and all pr. nigrescens were active against pr. intermedia. both species showed a high degree of activity against p. gingivalis, whereas only one p. gingivalis strain produced bacteriocin-like activity against either of the other two species. both pr. nigrescens and pr. intermedia showed some activity (40% and 20%, respectively) against other strains of the same species. such bacteriocin production might be expected to influence the distribution of these black-pigmented species in vivo. of 224 periodontal sites sampled, only 2.6% yielded mixed cultures of black-pigmented species and of these only one strain, a p. gingivalis isolate, produced bacteriocin-like activity against any of the other strains isolated from these sites. these data support the concept that local production of bacteriocin-like activity in vivo may contribute to the selection of the black-pigmented bacterial profile in subgingival sites.

AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

AB  == the incidence of black-pigmented rods (bprs), especially prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, in periodontal health and disease were examined. furthermore, the degradative enzyme activities of p. intermedia were compared among the strains from periodontal health and disease. microbiological specimens  were collected from subgingival crevice or periodontal pocket by paper point. the bprs were found in 71.1% of periodontally healthy subjects (n=45), and in 47.1% of healthy sites (n=34) and 87.8% of active sites (n=41) among periodontally diseased patients. porphyromonas gingivalis was detected only in active sites of  periodontally diseased patients (17.8% of 180 strains). p. intermedia was the predominant bpr in both healthy and active sites (37.3 and 41.7%, respectively) of the patients. however, p. nigrescens was the predominant bpr (70.5% of 173 strains) in periodontally healthy subjects. the enzyme activities of esterase, esterase-lipase, acid-phosphatase and alpha-fucosidase of p. intermedia strains isolated from active sites in patients were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those of healthy subjects. the results suggest that p. intermedia might increase  the activity of degradative enzymes under a certain condition and support the progression of periodontitis.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin on porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin (apolf) on the oral, black-pigmented anaerobes porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and p. nitrescens has been studied. apolf did not kill any of these species but it did inhibit the growth of p. gingivalis, while iron-saturated lf (felf) had no effect. the other  two species were unaffected by apolf. this growth inhibitory effect of apolf could not be explained on the basis of chelation of inorganic iron, since growth  of p. gingivalis occurred in the presence of ethylenediamine di-o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid provided haemin was added. both apolf and felf reduced haemin uptake by all three species and caused the release of cell-bound haemin in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, haemin reduced the binding of both apolf and felf to p. intermedia and p. nigrescens but stimulated the binding of lf by p. gingivalis. these data suggest that lf forms complexes with haemin in solution and competes for the binding of haemin to certain cell receptors, possibly lipopolysaccharides, but this is not sufficient to inhibit growth of the bacteria. p. gingivalis appears to bind lf-haemin complexes, as well as haemin alone, which may facilitate access of the lf to the outer and cytoplasmic membranes of p. gingivalis, so disrupting function.

TI  == black-pigmented bacteria in coronal and apical segments of infected root canals.
AB  == black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) have been associated with infections of endodontic origin. the purpose of this study was to culture and identify bpb from the apical and coronal segments of infected root canals to understand better their ecological relationships. teeth with a periapical radiolucency were extracted and immediately placed in reduced transport fluid for transport to an anaerobic chamber. of 18 sampled roots, 12 were positive for the growth of bpb. eight of the 12 roots with bpb had a carious exposure of the pulp chamber. seven roots had prevotella nigrescens in both the apical and the coronal segments. six of these seven teeth had carious exposures of the pulp chamber. of the 12 roots infected with bpb, six roots had two different species of bpb, with p. nigrescens always being one of the species. p. nigrescens was the most often isolated bpb from both the coronal and apical segments of infected root canals.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == the clinical and microbiological effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == 28 patients, 13 smokers and 15 non-smokers with untreated advanced periodontal disease, were subjected to a series of oral hygiene instructions and treated with non-surgical periodontal therapy. baseline values regarding clinical data did not differ significantly between the groups. 6 months following therapy the full-mouth bleeding score among smokers was 36.5% as compared to 22.7% for non-smokers (p < 0.05). probing depth was reduced by 1.9 mm for smokers and by 2.5 mm for non-smokers. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). the level of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia/nigrescens was reduced in both groups as compared to baseline. a. actinonmycetemcomitans, however demonstrated a slight increase in mean values at 6 months. this was especially notable for smokers in which a. actinomycetemcomitans were more difficult to eradicate. conclusively, the microbiological response found in this study seems to be in conformity with the clinical response with little influence of the smoking habits.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == periodontitis patient and the spouse: periodontal bacteria before and after treatment.
AB  == suspected periodontal pathogens can be transmitted between spouses. the treatment response may be unsuccessful in periodontitis patients, if the spouse harbors these bacteria. the aim of the present 6-month follow-up study was to clarify whether the microbiological treatment outcome of periodontitis patients is related to the detection of suspected periodontal pathogens in the saliva of the  spouse. 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and their spouses were included in the study. the patients received mechanical periodontal treatment and 500 mg metronidazole systemically 2x a day for 7 days. the presence of visible plaque, gingival bleeding after probing, suppuration, supragingival and subgingival calculus and pocket depths were assessed at baseline and 1 and 6 months after treatment. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus and peptostreptococcus micros were cultured from pooled subgingival samples from the  patients and from salivary samples from the spouses at corresponding occasions. periodontal conditions in the patients improved after treatment as determined by  the significantly lower values of clinical variables 1 and 6 months after treatment compared to those at baseline. however, the re-emergence of periodontal bacteria after treatment of the patients was not related to the concurrent detection of the respective bacteria in the saliva of the spouses. in this study  design, it seemed that the salivary bacterial load in the spouse was of minor importance for the microbiological treatment outcome of the patient.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == periodontal findings in cohen syndrome with chronic neutropenia.
AB  == radiographic periodontal status and microbiological findings of periodontal pockets in subjects with cohen syndrome are presented in this report. this hereditary disorder causes mental retardation, and neutropenia is one feature of  the syndrome. fifteen patients with cohen syndrome and 15 controls matched for age and sex and, as far as possible, according to the degree of mental retardation were examined. alveolar bone loss was evaluated from the panoramic radiographs. two subgingival samples were obtained from the most affected anterior and posterior periodontal sites in each dentate subject and examined for the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, bacteroides forsythus, and campylobacter rectus. subjects with cohen syndrome had alveolar bone loss more frequently and the bone loss was more extensive (mann-whitney u-test: p < 0.05) than in the controls. they also harbored one or several of the  putative periodontal pathogens (mann-whitney u-test: p < 0.001) more often than the controls. we conclude that subjects with cohen syndrome have increased susceptibility to early periodontal breakdown which is likely to be associated with neutropenia.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == hydrolytic and depolymerising enzyme activity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == objective: prevotella intermedia has been reported to be associated with periodontal disease whilst p. nigrescens has predominantly been isolated from more specific conditions and healthy sites. the aim of the present study was to compare the enzyme activity of these species. materials and methods: nine strains of p. intermedia and 12 strains of p. nigrescens were studied. lipolytic, saccharolytic, nucleolytic and proteolytic activity was determined by traditional microbiological and chromogenic substrate methods. results: all strains hydrolysed gelatine, casein, dna and rna. lipase activity was produced by all strains except p. nigrescens atcc 33563t. lipolytic activity of p. nigrescens strains decreased as the environmental glucose concentration was increased. only  two strains, both p. intermedia, hydrolysed benzyl-arg-rho-nitroanilide. all strains hydrolysed alkaline rho-nitrophenolphosphate (except p. intermedia dal100), produced glycylprolyl dipeptidase activity and demonstrated elastase-like activity. all but three strains (2 p. intermedia and i p. nigrescens) hydrolysed suc-ala-ala-pro-phe-rho-nitroanilide. overall, no qualitatively analysed enzyme activity was exclusive to all strains of either species. quantitatively analysed activity exhibited a high degree of variability  both within and between species. conclusions: p. intermedia and p. nigrescens degrade natural and synthetic substrates, but intra- and interspecies activity is variable.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

AB  == products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. it has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (sag) activity. sag bind simultaneously to the v beta chain of t cell receptors and to class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of t cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. in order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic t cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old balb/c (h-2d),  c57bl/6 (h-2b) and c3h/hej (h-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to seb, con a and escherichia coli lps. thymocytes responded to con a and seb, but not to lps or to any sonic extract. spleen cells depleted of b cells by panning responded to seb and con a, but not to lps and showed a reduced response to sonicates. the residual response of b cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-thy 1.2 + c'. similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not  limiting. these results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine t cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.

TI  == pcr reaction and dot-blot hybridization to monitor the distribution of oral pathogens within plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of the putative periodontal pathogens prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, the three oral capnocytophaga species (c. ochracea, c. sputigena, c. gingivalis), as well as porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals. we chose a newly developed 16s rdna directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and a previously described dot-blot hybridization assay to detect, differentiate, and quantify these bacteria directly in clinical samples. the subjects of these investigations were 66 sulcus fluid samples from 17 children (ages 3 to 5) attending a kindergarten, 48 sulcus  fluid samples from 12 children (ages 9 and 10) from a primary school, and 25 subgingival plaque samples isolated from 6 different periodontally healthy dental students (ages 24 to 27). we were able to demonstrate the presence of p. nigrescens in 54 (kindergarten: 5; primary school: 33; students: 16) samples by pcr and quantified it by dot-blot hybridization. in addition, we found c. ochracea in 12 (kindergarten: 2; primary school: 10) samples by pcr reaction only. the other tested bacterial species were absent by the methods used. furthermore we confirmed the specificity of our p. nigrescens-pcr in selected samples by enzyme electrophoresis.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction detection of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of gingivitis and advanced periodontitis lesions.
AB  == a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia. prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola in subgingival specimens of 50 advanced periodontitis, 50 adult gingivitis and 50 pediatric gingivitis subjects. the optimal pcr conditions were determined for each study species. agarose gel electrophoresis of pcr products from each study species revealed a single band of the predicted size. restriction enzyme digestion of amplicons confirmed the specificity of the amplification. pcr detection limits were in the range of 25-100 cells. no cross-reactivity with other oral micro-organisms or nonspecific amplification was observed. the prevalence by pcr in advanced periodontitis, adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis subjects was 30%, 14% and 14% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 86%, 18% and 8% for b. forsythus, 74%, 52% and 78% for c. rectus, 80%, 70% and 66% for e.  corrodens, 70%, 10% and 14% for p. gingivalis, 58%, 12% and 18% for p. intermedia, 52%, 20% and 22% for p. nigrescens, and 54%, 16% and 16% for t. denticola, respectively. the prevalence was higher in the advanced periodontitis  group than in both adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis for a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens  and t. denticola at p < 0.01, and for e. corrodens at p < 0.05. the prevalence of c. rectus was significantly higher in the advanced periodontitis group than in the adult gingivitis group at p < 0.01. matching results between pcr and culture  occurred in 28% (b. forsythus) to 71% (a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the samples;  the major discrepancy occurred in the pcr-positive/culture-negative category. matching results between pcr and dna probe methods were found in 84% of the subjects (b. forsythus) and 70% (p. gingivalis). odds ratio analysis revealed statistically significant positive associations between 17 of the 28 possible combinations (p < 0.01). this study demonstrated the utility of a 16s rrna-based  pcr detection method for identifying important subgingival microorganisms. the results indicated a strong association between the study species and periodontitis. several previously unreported symbiotic relationships were found between the 8 species tested.

TI  == clonality of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolated from periodontally diseased and healthy sites.
AB  == black-pigmented anaerobes have been implicated as major pathogens in the aetiology of adult periodontitis but these organisms are also found in healthy sites. this study aimed to examine the relationship between genotypes of black-pigmented anaerobes and disease status of periodontal sites using restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) and ribotyping. the main black-pigmented  species recovered from sites were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. each of the 58 subjects investigated harboured distinct genotypes of these three species. most subjects appeared to be colonized by a single genotype of p. gingivalis and pr. intermedia, whereas multiple types  of pr. nigrescens colonized many individuals. plasmids were only found in a few pr. nigrescens strains. no association was found between the disease status of sites and any specific or group of genotypes of either species or presence of a plasmid. since the same genotypes of p. gingivalis, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were found at both diseased and non-diseased sites in a subject, adult periodontitis is not explained by the presence of specially virulent clones of these organisms. their role in periodontitis, therefore, is likely to be opportunistic.

TI  == phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of porphyromonas and prevotella species.
AB  == species of prevotella (pr.) and porphyromonas (po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 j cm(-2)). fluences of 35 to 80 j cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in po. endodontalis, po. gingivalis, pr. denticola, pr. intermedia, pr. melaninogenica and pr. nigrescens. a fluence of 70 j cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of bacillus, candida, enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus  and streptococcus. the phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against prevotella and porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin  content of the cells. overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of  argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of prevotella or porphyromonas.

TI  == source of suspected periodontal pathogens re-emerging after periodontal treatment.
AB  == to clarify the source of re-emerging periodontal pathogens after treatment, we compared the ribotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group and campylobacter rectus before and after treatment in 7 periodontitis patients and in 6 of the spouses. the patients harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group or c. rectus in their subgingival or salivary samples before treatment. the respective bacterial species were not detected 1 month after treatment, but reappeared by 6 months later. when available, 4 random colonies of each of the 4 species were isolated from both subgingival and salivary samples at each sampling occasion, the isolates were subcultured, identified and typed applying pheno- and genotypic intraspecies characterization  methods. altogether 90 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus were available from 2, 3, 2 and 4 patients, respectively. the pre- and post-treatment ribotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans-, p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group-isolates were identical in all respective patients. the pre- and post-treatment ribotypes of c. rectus were identical in 1 of 4 patients, whereas  2 patients harbored a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype and 1 patient harbored the initial and a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype. to study the possibility that periodontitis patients may acquire strains from the spouse after treatment, isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus (n = 95) from the patients' spouses were ribotyped and compared with those of the patients. the patient exhibited his own post-treatment ribotypes, different from those of the spouse, of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis in 1 couple and of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens group and c. rectus in 1 couple. in the 2 patients who harbored a previously not detected post-treatment ribotype of c. rectus, one patient shared the new ribotype with the spouse, whereas the other one did not. although an exogenous source cannot be fully ruled out, the patient's own oral flora seems to be the main source of re-emerging periodontal pathogens after treatment.

TI  == chemiluminescent assay of alkaline phosphatase in human gingival crevicular fluid: investigations with an experimental gingivitis model and studies on the source of the enzyme within crevicular fluid.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how levels of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) alkaline phosphatase (alp) change in relation to levels of plaque and gingival inflammation in 20 adults during a 21 day period of experimental gingivitis. the source of alp within gcf was also investigated using a repeat sampling protocol; by determining enzyme levels derived from 30 putative periodontal pathogenic and non-pathogenic species; and by examining inhibition profiles from a variety of host and bacterial alp isoenzymes. total 30-s gcf alp  levels increased significantly (p < 0.002) during experimental gingivitis and preceded an increase in gingival index (gi) by approximately 7 days. enzyme levels correlated with gcf volume (r = 0.7; p < 0.0001), but repeat sampling indicated that entry of alp into the gingival crevice was independent of the rate of fluid flow. only 5 of the bacterial species investigated produced clearly detectable levels of alp in culture supernatants, these were p. gingivalis (381), p. intermedia (581), p. nigrescens (8944), dentin p. gingivalis (tw 471: clinical isolate) and c. ochracea (25). levamisole inhibition and studies on suspensions of washed plaque demonstrated that host-derived alp contributed to > 80% of the enzyme in gcf. we conclude that elevated 30-s gcf alp levels measured using the chemiluminescent assay reported, are detectable before increases in gingival indices and appear to be a better marker of gingival inflammation than alp concentrations. the major source of alp within gcf is host derived and in early inflammatory disease is likely to be of polymophonuclear leukocyte origin.

TI  == binding and degradation of lactoferrin by porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the ability of laboratory and clinical strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens to bind and to degrade lactoferrin (lf) has been assessed. lf bound readily to whole cells of each species apparently via high-affinity site and one or more low-affinity sites. p.  gingivalis showed a lower affinity for lf than the other two species (p < 0.001). virtually all strains of p. gingivalis completely degraded lf under the conditions employed, whereas p. intermedia and p. nigrescens showed only partial  degradation. these data suggest that lf binds to a high-affinity receptor on all  these bacteria and, particularly in the case of p. gingivalis, is then degraded by cell-associated proteases. this property may provide protection to the cell against the effects of lf in periodontal sites and so is a possible virulence factor in disease. there was no association between the ability to degrade lf and whether the strains had originated from healthy or diseased oral sites.

TI  == analytical performance of an immunologic-based periodontal bacterial test for simultaneous detection and differentiation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == the analytical performance of a membrane-based immunoassay for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia (including prevotella nigrescens) was investigated. positive reactions were observed for 71 of 71 reference strains and recent oral isolates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia. no cross-reactivity was observed with 39 other common oral and environmental species. the specificity of the test was unaffected by the presence of potential oral interferents including whole blood, white blood cells, mucin, saliva, toothpastes, and oral rinses. a proficiency test by dental  professionals using a standardized set of unknown simulated samples yielded a sensitivity of 97% (116/120) and a 100% specificity (240/ 240). an additional group including dental professionals and high school students was shown to be 99% proficient (1385/1397) in distinguishing proper from improper test function when  processing control samples with normal test devices and devices with simulated error conditions. comparisons to a culture standard for 104 subgingival plaque samples collected from 26 adult periodontitis patients yielded > 98% specificity  for each of the test bacteria. in addition, the detection threshold for the test  was determined to be equivalent to 10(4) cultivable test bacteria when compared to the culture standard. the data indicate that this membrane immunoassay is a valid and easy-to-use method for the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia in subgingival plaque, at levels above the detection threshold of the test.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

TI  == an investigation into the use of sds-page of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == by comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 prevotella intermedia and 19 prevotella nigrescens strains using  sds and analysed by sds-page, it was possible to distinguish the two species. a polypeptide of approx. 21 kda distinguished p. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kda could be used to identify p. nigrescens strains. four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii and prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kda polypeptides shown by p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. the cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of p. intermedia, 14 strains of p. nigrescens and one strain of p. gingivalis (w50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. the hydrolysis of the substrate gppna (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase iv-like activity) and  saappna (elastase-like activity) by p. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined  as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of p. intermedia strains hydrolysed saappna (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. the hydrolysis of gppna and saaapna by p. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of p. nigrescens strains hydrolysed saapppna with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. none of the p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (bapna hydrolysis). the gppna and saaapna hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 was at least twice that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens strains. the similar peptidase activities of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but sds-page of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. this simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide increases cell surface-associated fibronectin in fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  == this study assessed the fibronectin expression by fibroblasts derived from noninflamed and inflamed gingiva by measuring the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin and fibronectin released into the medium. the effects of added lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and escherichia coli on both types of fibroblasts were also studied. in the absence of lipopolysaccharide, the amounts of the two types of fibronectin were significantly larger in the fibroblasts from inflamed than from noninflamed  gingiva. the specific lipopolysaccharide had no effect on the amount of fibronectin released into the medium by either fibroblast type. the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin increased significantly when lipopolysaccharide (0.1 and 1 microgram/ml) was added to the cells from the noninflamed gingiva (the effect was evident in the order: p. gingivalis>p.nigrescens>e. coli). lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis significantly increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin even at a low concentration of lipopolysaccharide (0.01 microgram/ml). in fibroblasts from the  inflamed gingiva, only the lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis was effective in increasing the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin. our findings showed that the fibronectin expression was increased in the fibroblasts from inflamed gingiva and that lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin.

AB  == sonic extracts from the test strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were tested for the ability to inactivate kanamycin sulfate in the presence of atp or acetyl coenzyme a (acetyl-coa). residual kanamycin activity was determined by a bio-assay using escherichia coli  jm109 as the assay organism. sonic extracts of all test strains of p. gingivalis  inactivated kanamycin. all strains tested in this study required the presence of  acetyl-coa for inactivation, indicating that inactivation was by acetylation. the gene of a kanamycin-inactivating protein from p. gingivalis 16-1 was cloned into  e. coli utilizing the plasmid vector ptz18r. the resultant kanamycin-resistant clone, harboring plasmid ppg16 with a p. gingivalis insert, expressed a kanamycin-inactivating activity, which was enhanced by the addition of acetyl-coa, confirming that the kanamycin was inactivated by acetylation. southern blot analysis indicates that the gene was conserved among all p. gingivalis strains tested.

TI  == characterisation of black-pigmented anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy  periodontal sites.
AB  == prevotella intermedia has recently been re-defined and a new species, prevotella  nigrescens has been proposed. however, there is little data available on the incidence of these new species in periodontal health or disease. black-pigmented  anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy subgingival sites were identified by serotyping, sds-page and physiological tests. in adult periodontitis subjects, 64% of active sites, 35.7% of inactive sites and 38.5% of healthy sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. of these, porphyromonas gingivalis was found in 11% of active and 5% of healthy sites in diseased patients, prevotella intermedia in 15.5% of active and 20.5% of healthy sites, prevotella nigrescens in 37.7% of active and 11.5% of healthy sites and prevotella denticola in 3% of active and 1% of healthy sites. in healthy subjects, 50% of sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. p. gingivalis was not found in healthy subjects but p. intermedia was  found in 18% and p. nigrescens in 31% of sites. sds-page proved to be a useful method for routinely differentiating p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and two sub-types of the latter species were detected on the basis of band pattern. only  one p. nigrescens sub-type was found in any given individual and one type, typified by atcc 25261, was more commonly found in deep pockets. however, overall both p. nigrescens and p. intermedia as species were just as frequently found at  healthy sites as diseased sites. thus, these species, in contrast to p. gingivalis, appear to be common commensals but they may act as opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == effects of cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on the leukocyte function-associated antigen 1/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 pathway in gingival fibroblasts in adult periodontitis.
AB  == we investigated the effects of inflammatory cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and e-selectin (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1) in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). cell surface icam-1 was upregulated on hgf under transcriptional control by exposure not only to interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon but also to sonic extracts prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia (nigrescens) and lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli. however, these stimuli induced only minimal expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and  e-selectin on hgf. binding assays using hgf and molt 4, the human t-cell leukemia cell line, showed induced icam-1 to be functional, and the increased binding was  blocked by a combination of monoclonal antibodies against icam-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. furthermore, gingival tissues from adult periodontitis patients showed increased mrna expression of icam-1 compared with that in tissues from normal healthy donors. in immunohistological analysis, we also observed in vivo that the expression of icam-1 on fibroblasts in adult periodontitis tissues was greater than that in normal gingiva. thus, the overexpression of icam-1 on gingival fibroblasts induced by cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria is speculated to be deeply involved in the accumulation and retention of leukocyte function-associated antigen 1-bearing leukocytes in adult periodontitis lesions.

TI  == effect of initial therapy on dynamics of immunogloblin g levels to some periodontopathic bacteria in serum and gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the igg antibody levels to specific gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria in serum of 21 adult periodontitis patients and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) from 42 sites with destructive lesions and 21 healthy sites were evaluated before and after initial preparation. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples from the patients were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. subgingival plaque, gcf, and serum samples were taken at baseline and three weeks after initial preparation. for 14 patients, changes in clinical parameters due to the initial preparation were correlated with reduction of periodontopathogens and to  igg antibody levels in gcf and serum against them. p. gingivalis, t. denticola and c. rectus were found to be predominant in destructive sites. no significant differences were found in gcf igg antibody levels between destructive and healthy sites. in destructive sites, the prevalence of p. gingivalis and c. rectus was significantly correlated with elevated igg antibody against these microorganisms  in gcf. the initial preparation resulted in significant reduction of serum igg antibody levels against all microorganisms tested. no decrease in gcf igg antibody was observed, but levels to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were significantly increased (p<0.05). the assessment of gcf igg antibodies to specific periodontopathic bacteria may be of considerable value in reflecting the conditions of periodontitis.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == effect of therapy on periodontal infections.
AB  == periodontal disease progression requires the simultaneous presence of high numbers of pathogens, low numbers of compatible or beneficial species, a conductive local environment, and a susceptible host. effective therapy acts by altering one or more of these factors. data from an ongoing study were used to examine the biological basis of treatment success or failure. seventeen subjects  showing disease progression were treated by widman flap surgery at deep sites, scaling at shallow sites, and 1 of 4 randomly-assigned, systemically-administered adjunctive agents including amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (au) (n = 3), ibuprofen (n = 3), tetracycline (n = 9), or a placebo (n = 2). clinical measurements and microbiological samples (enumerated using dna probes) taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth pre-treatment and 12 months post-treatment were compared and 418 pre- and 418 post-therapy plaque samples were enumerated. overall, the 4 treatments resulted in pocket depth reduction and "gain" in attachment. after therapy, the percentage of sites colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and bacteroides forsythus was decreased and counts > 10(6) were less frequent. large attachment level gains were accompanied by major decreases in these species and were more frequent in subjects receiving antibiotics. a small number of sites in each treatment group became deeper and/or lost attachment. more than half of these sites were detected in 2 subjects who were older (65 vs. 44), had higher serum antibody to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a (506 vs. 125 elisa units), a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b (518 vs. 130), and campylobacter rectus (39 vs. 18).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
