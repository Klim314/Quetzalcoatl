TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.
