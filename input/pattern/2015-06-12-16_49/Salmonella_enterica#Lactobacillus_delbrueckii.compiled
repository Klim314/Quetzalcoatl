TI  - The expression of adhesin EF-Tu in response to mucin and its role in Lactobacillus adhesion and competitive inhibition of enteropathogens to mucin.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the expression of EF-Tu in Lactobacillus strains with response to mucin exposure and its role in interfering with adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Lactobacillus strains were analysed for their ability to adhere to immobilized mucin in microtiter plates. Lactobacillus delbrueckii M and Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 showed statistically significant adhesion to mucin, which was similar to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, the best binding probiotic strain. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lact. delbrueckii M, Lact. plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 were able to effectively antagonize the adhesion of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi to mucin. In the presence of Lactobacillus adhesin - EF-Tu, the adhesion of Lact. delbrueckii M and the strains of Lact. plantarum to mucin was significantly inhibited. Similarly, EF-Tu also reduced the adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. Furthermore, the relative fold change in gene expression analysis showed significant up-regulation of EF-Tu gene in the strains of Lact. plantarum and Lact. delbrueckii M when exposed to mucin for 3 h. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the significant role of EF-Tu in lactobacilli adhesion and enteropathogens inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study suggests EF-Tu as an important factor linked to the Lactobacillus adhesion as well as enteropathogen inhibition. Lactobacillus plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 can be used as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Comparative study of the protective capacity against Salmonella infection between probiotic and nonprobiotic Lactobacilli.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the immunoprotective ability of three Lactobacilli strains against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in a mouse model. To identify the probiotic properties involved in the protection against infection caused by this pathogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The immunomodulatory effect of three different lactobacilli strains: Lactobacillus (Lact.) casei CRL 431 (probiotic bacterium), Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 423 (Lact. bulgaricus) and Lact.acidophilus CRL 730 was compared using a mouse model of Salmonella infection. Lactobacillus casei continuous administration improved animal survival, diminished pathogen spreading outside the intestine, attenuated the intestinal inflammation, modulated cytokine profile previous and postinfection and increased the expression and secretion of IgA in the gut. Additionally, the administration of this lactobacilli increased peritoneal, Peyer's patches and spleen macrophages' phagocytic activity in healthy mice and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) released by intestinal epithelial cells in an in vitro assay. Although Lact. acidophilus increased the number of IgA-secreting cells previous and postinfection, and Lact. bulgaricus increased MCP-1 released by intestinal epithelial cells and the phagocytic activity of macrophages, these effects alone were not enough to confer protection against Salmonella Typhimurium infection in mouse. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic strain Lact. casei CRL 431 was the one that induced protection against Salmonella, by increasing the intestinal barrier function and by decreasing the local inflammatory response. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Salmonella spp. constitutes an important agent of foodborne diseases in the world. Not all lactobacilli, even with some immunostimulating properties at gut level, can protect against Salmonella infection. Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, a probiotic bacterium, could be useful as an oral mucosal adjuvant of the immune system to improve gut health, especially in the prevention or amelioration of Salmonella infections. We demonstrated that there is not a unique mechanism by which this protective effect was exerted.
TI  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis R4 prevents Salmonella typhimurium SL1344-induced damage to tight junctions and adherens junctions.
AB  - Cell junctions are the gatekeepers of the paracellular route and defend the mucosal barrier. Several enteropathogenic bacteria can invade intestinal epithelial cells by targeting and damaging cell junctions. It is not well understood how Salmonella typhimurium is able to overcome the intestinal barrier and gain access to the circulation, nor is it understood how Lactobacillus prevents the invasion of S. typhimurium. Therefore, we sought to determine whether infection with S. typhimurium SL1344 could regulate the molecular composition of cell junctions and whether Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis R4 could affect this modification. Our data demonstrated that infection of Caco-2 cells with S. typhimurium over 2 h resulted in a redistribution of claudin-1, ZO-1, occluding, and E-cadherin. Western blot analysis of epithelial cell lysates demonstrated that S. typhimurium could decrease the expression of cell junction proteins. However, L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis R4 ameliorated this destruction and induced increased expression of ZO-1, occludin, and E-cadherin relative to the levels in the control group. The results of these experiments implied that S. typhimurium may facilitate its uptake and distribution within the host by regulating the molecular composition of cell junctions. Furthermore, Lactobacillus may prevent the adhesion and invasion of pathogenic bacteria by maintaining cell junctions and the mucosal barrier.
TI  - Probiotics protect mice against experimental infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our group has concerned itself with the study of the effect of probiotics on the resistance to infections using experimental models. Here, we will focus on evidence that the UFV-H2b20 strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii var. bulgaricus may be considered a probiotic and has protective effects on mice against a variety of bacterial infections. METHODS: Germ-free, monoassociated, and conventional mice were used. Mice were treated with probiotics and challenged with Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, or Listeria monocytogenes, and the outcome of infection was measured as mortality, quantification of bacteria in target organs, and systemic of local cytokine production. RESULTS: L. delbrueckii increased clearance of E. coli and production of systemic inflammatory cytokines. This strain also protected monoassociated and conventional mice against infection with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Finally, monoassociated mice were more resistant to L. monocytogenes as measured by mortality and the number of bacteria in spleen and liver. In addition, monoassociated mice challenged with L. monocytogenes showed increased production of inflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and nitric oxide. Interestingly, interleukin-10 levels were not altered by monoassociation or infection. CONCLUSIONS: L. delbrueckii UFV-H2b20 protects mice against infection, apparently by eliciting the up-regulation of production of inflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Identification and characterization of starter lactic acid bacteria and probiotics from Columbian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: Considering the significant rise in the probiotic market in Columbia, and given the lack of reports concerning the microbial population and strain performance in products from different producers, this study aims at determining the number of viable starter bacteria and probiotics in bio-yoghurts available at the Columbian market, identifying the species and analysing the performance of the isolated strains in bile acid resistance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, and adherence capacity to human intestinal epithelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven bio-yoghurts were analysed for the bacterial species present. Species identification was carried out using 16S rRNA gene targeted PCR. The cultured bacteria were tested for bile acid resistance, adherence to a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and antagonism against the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A total of 17 different strains were identified. Based on plate counting, all bio-yoghurts have at least total viable cells of approximately 10(7) CFU ml(-1). Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were the most frequently isolated bacteria. Viable Bifidobacterium was only recovered from one product. However, after PCR analysis, DNA of this genus was confirmed in five out of seven products. Major differences were found for S. typhimurium antagonism. The adherence capacity to Caco-2 cells was observed in 10 of the isolated strains. In general, low survival to simulated gastric juice was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the isolated strains have probiotic potential, although not all of them were present in the advised amount to exert beneficial health effects. However, the full correct scientific name of the isolated bacteria and their viable counts were not included on the product label. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report describing the identification and functionality of starter bacteria and probiotics present in dairy products on the Columbian market.
TI  - Oral administration of a live Aro attenuated Salmonella vaccine strain expressing 14-kDa Schistosoma mansoni fatty acid-binding protein induced partial protection against experimental schistosomiasis.
AB  - We report the oral vaccination of SWISS mice with an Aro attenuated Salmonella enterica var. Typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the 14-kDa Schistosoma mansoni antigen, Sm14. Bacterial adjuvants, including (i) Lactococcus lactis expressing interleukin-12 (IL-12) and (ii) Lactobacillus delbrueckii UFV-H2b20, were also employed in oral immunization assays. Detection assays to specific IgG and IgA anti-Sm14 antibodies were performed to evaluate humoral immune responses in vaccinated mice. An increase in specific IgG titers was observed; however, no IgA production was detected. The protection levels against schistosomiasis (34.9-49.5%) obtained with all experimental formulations in this work were very similar to values reported by previous studies, which used purified recombinant Sm14 for parenteral vaccination of mice. There was a slight reduction in hepatic granulomas of mice vaccinated with Salmonella. Oogram studies showed diminished numbers of S. mansoni eggs in the intestinal wall of vaccinated mice, but individual female worm fecundity did not seem to be affected by our immunization protocol.
TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri CRL1098 produces cobalamin.
AB  - We found that Lactobacillus reuteri CRL1098, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from sourdough, is able to produce cobalamin. The sugar-glycerol cofermentation in vitamin B(12)-free medium showed that this strain was able to reduce glycerol through a well-known cobalamin-dependent reaction with the formation of 1,3-propanediol as a final product. The cell extract of L. reuteri corrected the coenzyme B12 requirement of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 7830 and allowed the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (metE cbiB) and Escherichia coli (metE) in minimal medium. Preliminary genetic studies of cobalamin biosynthesis genes from L. reuteri allowed the identification of cob genes which encode the CobA, CbiJ, and CbiK enzymes involved in the cobalamin pathway. The cobamide produced by L. reuteri, isolated in its cyanide form by using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, showed a UV-visible spectrum identical to that of standard cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12).
TI  - Antagonistic action of cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in fresh meat systems.
AB  - Cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis RM2-5 were added to various meat model systems that had been inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Salmonella Typhimurium to determine whether these lactobacilli were antagonistic to the pathogens during storage at 5 degrees C. Experiments in which L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis RM2-5 was directly applied to the surfaces of beefsteaks resulted in significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the growth of psychrotrophs and coliforms plus a slight decrease in the numbers of E. coli O157:H7 over time relative to those for control samples to which no lactobacilli had been added. Experiments involving the direct application of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis RM2-5 to the surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef and pork carcass samples inoculated with either E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella Typhimurium showed significant (P < 0.05) declines in numbers of the pathogens as well as a reduction in the growth of psychrotrophs during storage at 5 degrees C for 6 days. The results of the experiments suggest that lactobacillus cultures have potential for use in an intervention technology for the control of foodborne pathogens, especially on the surfaces of beef and pork carcasses. The results of this study also suggest that an extension of the shelf life of meat can result from the decreased growth of psychrotrophic spoilage organisms.
TI  - Heat resistance of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium and Lactobacillus delbrueckii in relation to pH and ethanol.
AB  - The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of ethanol alone and in combination with low pH on the heat resistance of specific bacteria. The bacteria chosen are representative of heat resistant and heat sensitive pathogens (Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium) and of relatively heat resistant spoilage microorganisms (Lactobacillus delbrueckii). The chosen bacteria were treated at different temperatures ranging between 70 and 97 degrees C for B. cereus, 48 and 54 degrees C for S. typhimurium and 44 and 60 degrees C for L. delbrueckii, in media of different pH (3, 5 and 7) and ethanol content (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10%). Both factors proved to be very effective in reducing the heat resistance of the bacteria examined in this work. At pH 7, an increase in ethanol content up to 10% caused D values to decrease by up to 100-fold (S. typhimurium). A drop from pH 7 to pH 3 also caused up to a 100-fold reduction in the D values (S. typhimurium). For B. cereus the regression analysis of the log10 of the D value in relation to temperature, pH and ethanol content was used to produce a second order polynomial equation. The z values increased at decreasing pH and cells were more sensitive to ethanol at lower pH. For S. typhimurium the polynomial equation produced to describe the relationship between log10 of the D values and temperature and ethanol content was also a second order equation indicating that the relationship between z values and ethanol was non-linear. For L. delbrueckii, z values were independent of the ethanol content of the heating medium. Acid tolerance at 25 and 37 degrees C (L. delbrueckii and S. typhimurium) and acid adaptation (S. typhimurium) were also tested. L. delbrueckii was more ethanol and pH tolerant than S. typhimurium at heat treatment temperatures whilst S. typhimurium was more acid tolerant than L. delbrueckii at incubation temperatures (25 and 37 degrees C). Acid adaptation increased the tolerance of S. typhimurium to low pH at 25 degrees C but failed to improve its thermal resistance at 48 degrees C. In all bacteria used, the effects of pH and ethanol were more evident at lower treatment temperatures and therefore their significance becomes greater in view of reduced thermal processing and/or changes in product formulation.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  - A new bacteriocin, produced by Streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. By its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other S. thermophilus bacteriocin. The mode of action is bacteriostatic. This peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several Bacillus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica. This bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by pH variation from 3 to 10. Six months of storage at 40 degrees C did not influence the activity. The inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in SDS-PAGE supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. The low sensitivity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to the isolated bacteriocin suggests that S. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt starters.
TI  - Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium attachment to chicken cecal mucus by intestinal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli.
AB  - The ability of selected strains of Enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of adult chickens to inhibit in vitro attachment of Salmonella typhimurium 3333/O to cecal mucus in the presence or absence of D-mannose was determined. Attachment in the absence of mannose was reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, an Escherichia coli and a Hafnia alvei strain, but not to a third isolate, an Enterobacter agglomerans strain. Attachment of S. typhimurium was not inhibited when mannose was present in the blocking or attachment step. Formation of fimbriae by the two inhibitory Enterobacteriaceae strains and the S. typhimurium strain, as indicated by titers of mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes was optimal in Z biphasic medium (consisting of tryptone, yeast extract, dextrose, and NaCl) incubated anaerobically at 42 C. Fimbriae of each of three strains prepared from these cultures also inhibited attachment. These are characteristics consistent with attachment and inhibition of attachment mediated by a mannose-sensitive adhesin associated with type 1 fimbriae on bacterial cells of Enterobacteriaceae strains. Attachment in the presence of mannose was significantly reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of a Lactobacillus salivarius strain and a Lactobacillus delbrueckii delbrueckii strain but not to a strain of Lactobacillus for which the species had not been determined. Washed cells or spent culture supernatant fluid from brain-heart infusion broth, Z broth, or Z biphasic cultures of the inhibitory strains of lactobacilli incubated at 37 or 42 C inhibited this form of attachment. Of 27 intestinal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and 21 of lactobacilli, the lactobacilli strains were generally more hydrophobic than the Enterobacteriaceae as determined by adherence to hexadecane. The lactobacilli isolates did not agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes. The data suggest more than one mechanism for mediating attachment of inhibitory bacterial strains and for subsequent attachment of S. typhimurium.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: Lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. Independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. Although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. We recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) (Mutation Res. (1995) 334, 213-224). We are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against MNNG.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  - It was shown that cell extracts and cells of Streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. Cell extracts and cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and Propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. No antimutagenic effect was found in Escherichia coli AB1157, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Antimutageneicity of the cell extract of Str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. Thiol compounds produced by growing Str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. A relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a MM less than 12 kDa are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the S. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  - A high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. One way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of DNA damage and other types of anticarcinogens. Specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. We have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. Four types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. The effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Eight of 10 isolated Lactobacillus strains reduced the yield of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. Different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. The degree of suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. In contrast, yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. The other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "Dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. The results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.
