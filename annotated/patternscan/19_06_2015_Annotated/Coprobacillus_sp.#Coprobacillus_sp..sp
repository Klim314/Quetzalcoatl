TI  == changes of poultry faecal microbiota associated with clostridium difficile colonisation.
AB  == bacterial, fungal and archaeal microbiota was analysed in 143 chicken faecal samples from a single poultry farm. after dhplc (denaturing high performance liquid chromatography) 15 bacterial groups, 10 fungal groups and a single archaeal species were differentiated. samples were grouped into two clusters with significantly different frequencies of c. difficile positive and negative samples in each cluster. acidaminococcus intestini, described here for the first time as  a part of poultry faecal microbiota, was significantly more likely present in c.  difficile negative samples, while presence/absence of some other microorganisms (enterococcus cecorum, lactobacillus galinarum, moniliella sp. and trichosporon asahii) was close to significance. two other groups not reported previously for poultry, coprobacillus sp. and turicibacter sp. did not differ significantly between c. difficile positive and negative samples. differences in microbiota diversity depend on animal age, but not on the presence of c. difficile. with machine learning (weka j48) we have defined specific combinations of microbial groups predictive for c. difficile colonisation. microbial groups associated with c. difficile colonisation in poultry are different than those reported for humans and include bacteria as well as fungi. also with this approach a. intestini was found to be most strongly related to c. difficile negative samples.

TI  == prevalence and diversity of microbes in the amniotic fluid, the fetal inflammatory response, and pregnancy outcome in women with preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes.
AB  == problem: the role played by microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (miac) in preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes (pprom) is inadequately characterized, in  part because of reliance on cultivation-based methods. method of study: amniotic  fluid from 204 subjects with pprom was analyzed with both cultivation and molecular methods in a retrospective cohort study. broad-range and group-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays targeted small subunit ribosomal dna (rdna), or other gene sequences, from bacteria, fungi, and archaea. results were  correlated with measurements of host inflammation, as well as pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. results: the prevalence of miac was 34% (70/204) by culture,  45% (92/204) by pcr, and 50% (101/204) by both methods combined. the number of bacterial species revealed by pcr (44 species-level phylotypes) was greater than  that by culture (14 species) and included as-yet uncultivated taxa. some taxa detected by pcr have been previously associated with the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., coprobacillus sp.), the mouth (e.g., rothia dentocariosa), or the vagina in the setting of bacterial vaginosis (e.g., atopobium vaginae). the relative risk for histologic chorioamnionitis was 2.1 for a positive pcr [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.4-3.0] and 2.0 for a positive culture (95% ci, 1.4-2.7). bacterial rdna abundance exhibited a dose relationship with gestational age at delivery (r(2) = 0.26; p < 0.01). a positive pcr was associated with lower mean birthweight, and with higher rates of respiratory distress syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis (p < 0.05 for each outcome). conclusion: miac in pprom  is more common than previously recognized and is associated in some cases with uncultivated taxa, some of which are typically associated with the gastrointestinal tract. the detection of miac by molecular methods has clinical significance.

TI  == paenibacillus jamilae sp. nov., an exopolysaccharide-producing bacterium able to  grow in olive-mill wastewater.
AB  == endospore-forming strains were isolated from corn-compost treated with olive-mill wastewater ('alpechin'). the strains were taxonomically studied and proposed as a novel paenibacillus species. these organisms (strains b.3t, b.7 and b.9) were particularly distinguishable from other aerobic spore-forming species by their ability to grow optimally in 100% (v/v) olive-mill wastewater at 30 degrees c and ph 7.0 and concomitant production of an interesting exopolysaccharide. chemotaxonomic analysis revealed that mk-7 was the predominant menaquinone, the major fatty acid was anteiso c15:0 and the cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. the dna g+c content was 40.7 mol%. comparative sequence analysis of 16s rdna with different reference species from the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, brevibacillus, aneurinibacillus, alicyclobacillus, halobacillus, virgibacillus, amphibacillus, coprobacillus and gracilibacillus indicated that the isolated strains were highly related to the genus paenibacillus. strain b.3t  formed an evolutionary lineage distinct from other species within the evolutionary radiation encompassing the genus paenibacillus. strain b.3t was a close relative of paenibacillus polymyxa, but dna-dna relatedness data with this  species was very low (relative binding ratio < 16%). based on the morphological and physiological characteristics, as well as on the phylogenetic position determined by 16s rdna analysis and dna-dna relatedness data, it is concluded that these strains should be designated a novel species, for which the name paenibacillus jamilae sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is b.3t (= cect 5266t = dsm 13815t).

TI  == coprobacillus catenaformis gen. nov., sp. nov., a new genus and species isolated  from human feces.
AB  == three strains of eubacterium-like isolates from human feces were characterized by biochemical tests and 16s rdna analysis. the phenotypic characteristics of the three strains resembled those of the genus collinsella transferred from the genus eubacterium recently. however, eubacterium-like strains were phylogenetically members of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, and these showed  a specific phylogenetic association with clostridium ramosum and c. spiroforme. c. ramosum and c. spiroforme are gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria that belong to the genus clostridium, and the g + c contents are 26.0 and 27.4 mol%, respectively. however, the three eubacterium-like strains had g + c contents of 32.1 to 33.1 mol% and were non-spore-forming rods. based on phenotypic characteristics, we can differentiate these species, and furthermore,  a 16s rdna sequence divergence of greater than 9% with a new related genus, coprobacillus, is proposed for the three strains, with one species, coprobacillus catenaformis. the type strain of c. catenaformis is jcm 10604t.
