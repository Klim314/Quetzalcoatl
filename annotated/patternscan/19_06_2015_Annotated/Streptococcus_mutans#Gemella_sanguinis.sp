TI  == white-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  == white-spot lesions (wsl) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. we characterized the microbiota of wsl, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. participants were 60 children with  fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with wsl. plaque samples were  assayed by a 16s rrna-based microarray (homim) and by pcr. mean gingival index was positively associated with wsl (p = 0.018). taxa associated with wsl by microarray included granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), veillonellaceae sp. hot 155 (p < 0.01), and bifidobacterium cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qpcr, streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), actinomyces sp. hot 448 (p = 0.003), prevotella cluster iv (p = 0.021), and streptococcus sp. hot 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of s. mutans (p = 0.02) and bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qpcr. species' associations with wsl were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without wsl. granulicatella, veillonellaceae and bifidobacteriaceae, in addition  to s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of wsl in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with wsl.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
