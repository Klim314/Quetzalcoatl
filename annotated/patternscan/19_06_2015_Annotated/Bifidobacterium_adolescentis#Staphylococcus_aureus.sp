TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of b. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens e. coli and s. aureus.
AB  == the impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. the gut microbiota has been known to play a  crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a  potential new territory for drug targeting. herein, graphene oxide (go) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, b. adolescentis, l. acidophilus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus, was studied. it was shown that, in bacterial media, go sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of b. adolescentis against the pathogens e. coli ands. aureus. data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16s rrna gene sequencing consistently indicated that go sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for b. adolescentis. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and  that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with go sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of go. these results suggest the possibility of using go sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.

TI  == broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  == carbon nanotubes (cnts) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. previous observations have shown that cnts have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of cnts to human gut microbes has not been investigated. here, the antibacterial activity of cnts against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--l. acidophilus, b. adolescentis, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus--are evaluated. the bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. in this study, cnts, including single-walled cnts (swcnts, 1-3 mum), short and long  multi-walled cnts (s-mwcnts: 0.5-2 mum; l-mwcnts: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled cnts (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. notably, cnts may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of cnts, but also the shapes of the bacteria. the mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components dna and rna and allowing  a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. thin and rigid swcnt show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than mwcnts. long mwcnt may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. this work suggests that cnts may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of cnts could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic  bacteria.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of bifidobacterium spp. in the first part of the study,  the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of staphylococcus aureus. six strains, of sonicated bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of s. aureus s.p.-n2. in the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of bifidobacterium against propionibacterium acne kctc3320, using the co-culture method. the loss of p. acnes viability, caused by b. adolescentis spm0308 and b.  longum spm1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). in the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (no), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha  (tnf-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage raw 264.7 cell line. treatment of raw 264.7 cells, with bifidobacterium, decreased production of no and tnf-alpha rather than lps (100 ng/ml) treatment. the results suggest that  b. adolescentis spm0308 could be used as an effective control for p. acnes kctc3320, and s. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. we suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.

TI  == distinct gut microbiota in southeastern african and northern european infants.
AB  == background and objective: the intestinal microbiota composition in infants reflects the early environment. our objective was to compare the gut microbiota in 6-month-old infants living in rural malawi with children of the same age living in urban finland, both being breast-fed and having an age-appropriate diet typical for each area. methods: malawian 6-month-old infants (n=44) were compared with finnish infants (n=31) of the same age. in both cohorts, infant stool samples were available for microbiota characterization by flow cytometry-fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods. results: bifidobacteria were dominant at 6 months of age in all of the infants, although in greater proportions in malawian (70.8%) than in finnish infants (46.8%; p<0.001). additional distinctions in bacterial group composition comprised bacteroides-prevotella (17.2% vs 4.7%; p<0.001) and clostridium histolyticum (4.4% vs 2.8%; p=0.01), respectively. the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus  were absent in malawian but detected in finnish infants. conclusions: the gut microbiota of 6-month-old infants in a low-income country differs significantly from that in a high-income country. this may have an effect on both the energy harvest from the diet typifying malnutrition and diarrheal diseases in low-income countries and western lifestyle diseases in high-income countries.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == [influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  == aim: to assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. materials and methods: six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and rhodotorula rubra isolated  by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. in order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria  for obtaining the control samples. formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. results: performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. changes of these characteristics was observed both in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as  well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. conclusion: obtained data open perspective  for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.

TI  == detection of blastocystis from stool samples using real-time pcr.
AB  == we developed a real-time lc pcr assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the blastocystis genome. the described assay detected 11 of 11 atcc strains of blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. three of three stool samples from oregon and california military personnel that were negative for blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional pcr assay  were positive for blastocystis using our real-time lc pcr assay. diagnosis of blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including dna extraction and real-time pcr, only requires 3 h. the lower limit of detection for blastocystis in stool using the real-time lc pcr assay was calculated to be 760 cells of blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. the assay did not cross-react with ruminococcus hansenii, anarococcus hydrogenalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium prausnitzii, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in blastocystis infections in the usa we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of blastocystis infection.

TI  == effect of ph on an in vitro model of gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  == patients with dysphagia due to oropharyngeal disease or cerebrovascular accident  require long-term nutritional support via enteral feeding, which often results in microbial overgrowth in the upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract. gastric acid is the primary innate defense mechanism in the stomach and has been assumed to provide an effective barrier to microbial colonization at ph values of <4. to evaluate the efficacy of gastric acid as a barrier to overgrowth, the microbiota  of gastric and duodenal aspirates was assessed by culturing methods. additionally, a fermentor-based model incorporating enteral nutrition tubing of the gastric microbiota of enteral nutrition (en) patients was constructed to assess the effect of ph on the microbiota. results showed that gastric acidity had a relatively small effect on the numbers of microorganisms recovered from intestinal aspirates but did influence microbiota composition. similarly, at ph 3 in the fermentor, a complex microbiota developed in the planktonic phase and in biofilms. the effect of ph on microbiota composition was similar in aspirates and in the fermentors. candidas and lactobacilli were aciduric, while recoveries of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased as ph was reduced, although  both were still present in significant numbers at ph 3. only staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis persisted at higher ph values both in vitro and in vivo. lactate and acetate were the main organic acids detected in both aspirates and fermentors. these data show that the simulator used in this investigation was capable of modeling the effects of environmental influences on  the upper gi microbiota of en patients and that gastric ph of <4 is not sufficient to prevent microbial overgrowth in these individuals.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.
