TI  == production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  == in order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains lactobacillus brevis lbrz7, l. buchneri lbrz6, l. plantarum x2, l. paracasei rn5, l. sanfranciscensis r and l. fermentum lbrh10 and the probiotic strain propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327. the starter sourdoughs that include propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, b. mesentericus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp. and rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.the application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of taruba, an indigenous beverage produced from solid cassava fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify and characterize the microbiota present during fermentation and in the final beverage, taruba, by culture-dependent and -independent methods. in addition, target chemical compounds (carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol) were evaluated. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and mesophilic bacteria were the predominant microorganisms. among them, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis were frequently isolated and detected by dgge analysis. torulaspora delbrueckii was the dominant yeast species. yeast isolates pichia exigua, candida rugosa, t. delbrueckii, candida tropicalis, pichia kudriavzevii,  wickerhamomyces anomalus, and candida ethanolica and bacteria isolates lb. plantarum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus sp., and chitinophaga terrae showed amylolytic activity. only isolates of p. exigua and t. delbrueckii and all species of the genus bacillus identified  in this work exhibited proteolytic activity. all microbial isolates grew at 38 degrees c, and only the isolates belonging to hanseniaspora uvarum species did not grow at 42 degrees c. these characteristics are important for further development of starter cultures; isolates of t. delbrueckii, p. exigua, and bacillus species identified in this work displayed all of these properties and are potential strains for use as starter culture in cassava fermented food.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == inhibitors of biofilm formation by biofuel fermentation contaminants.
AB  == biofuel fermentation contaminants such as lactobacillus sp. may persist in production facilities by forming recalcitrant biofilms. in this study, biofilm-forming strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus plantarum were isolated and characterized from a dry-grind fuel ethanol plant. a variety of potential biofilm inhibitors were tested, including microbial polysaccharides, commercial enzymes, ferric ammonium citrate, liamocins, phage endolysin, xylitol, and culture supernatants from bacillus sp. a commercial enzyme mixture (novozyme 188) and culture supernatants from bacillus subtilis strains alt3a and rpt-82412 were identified as the most promising biofilm inhibitors. in biofilm flow cells, these inhibitors reduced the density of viable biofilm cells by 0.8-0.9 log cfu/cm(2). unlike b. subtilis strain rpt-82412, b. subtilis strain alt3a and novozyme 188 did not inhibit planktonic growth of lactobacillus sp. maldi-tof mass spectra showed the production of surfactin-like molecules by both b. subtilis strains, and the coproduction of iturin-like molecules by strain rpt-82412.

TI  == bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in manipur state of india.
AB  == soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of schizostachyum capitatum munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in manipur state of india. in this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rdna sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. this acidic starter (ph 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (lab) together. the population distribution of dominant species were bacillus subtilis 29.3%, bacillus cereus 35.7%, bacillus pumilus 2.6%, lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, enterococcus faecium 1.2% and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of b. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region and its-rflp profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in b. subtilis, five subgroups in b. cereus and three subgroups in l. brevis isolates. the most abundant b. subtilis subgroup ib.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during rapd analysis. the molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of bacillus and lab distributed in most of the starter samples. these dominant strains of b. subtilis, l. brevis and l. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.

TI  == microbial diversity of traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) as determined by pcr-mediated dgge.
AB  == the diversity of fungi and bacteria associated with traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) was investigated by pcr-mediated dgge. from 52 starter samples, 13 species of fungi (including yeasts) and 23 species of bacteria were identified. the fungal composition of the starters was consistent with little variation among samples. it consisted of amylase producers (rhizopus  oryzae, r. microsporus, absidia corymbifera, amylomyces sp., saccharomycopsis fibuligera), ethanol producers (saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia sp., pichia anomala, candida tropicalis, p. ranongensis, clavispora lusitaniae), and (opportunistic) contaminants (xeromyces bisporus, botryobasidium subcoronatum). the bacterial microflora of starters was highly variable in species composition and dominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequent lab were pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, weissella confusa, and w. paramesenteroides. species of amylase-producing bacillus (bacillus subtilis, b. circulans, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. sporothermodurans), acetic acid  bacteria (acetobacter orientalis, a. pasteurianus), and plant pathogens/environment contaminants (burkholderia ubonensis, ralstonia solanacearum, pelomonas puraquae) were also detected. fungal dgge was found to be useful for evaluating starter type and starter quality. moreover, in view of the  high biological diversity of these substrates, bacterial dgge may be useful in determining the identity of a starter. the constant occurrence of opportunistic contaminants highlights the need for careful examination of the role of individual components in starters.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of kojibiose phosphorylase gene from thermoanaerobacter brockii atcc35047.
AB  == a gene encoding kojibiose phosphorylase was cloned from thermoanaerobacter brockii atcc35047. the kojp gene encodes a polypeptide of 775 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of trehalose phosphorylase from t. brockii and maltose phosphorylases from bacillus sp. and lactobacillus brevis with 35%, 29% and 28% identities, respectively. kojibiose phosphorylase was efficiently overexpressed in escherichia coli jm109. the dna sequence of 3956 bp analyzed in this study contains three open reading frames (orfs) downstream of kojp. the four orfs, kojp, koje, kojf, and kojg, form a gene cluster. the amino acid sequences deduced from koje and kojf are similar to those of the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of a sugar-binding periplasmic protein from thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis mb4. furthermore, the amino acid sequence deduced from kojg is similar to that of a permease of the abc-type sugar transport systems from t. tengcongensis mb4. each of three amino acid substitutions, d362n, k614q and e642q, caused a complete loss of kojibiose phosphorylase activity. these results suggest that d362, k614 and e642 play an important role in catalysis. another mutation, d459n, increased k(m) values for kojibiose (7-fold that for the wild type), beta-g1p (11-fold) and glucose (7-fold), whereas k(m) for inorganic phosphate was minimally affected by this mutation, suggesting that d459 may be involved in the binding to saccharides.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in brazil.
AB  == sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in brazil. thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of  minas gerais. the samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). lactobacillus perolans and lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. galactomyces geothricum and issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). a species similar to candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. b. cereus was found  at low numbers in product at both factories. the spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.

TI  == effects of three microbial probiotics on postprandial porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose, galactose and amino-nitrogen in the young pig.
AB  == postprandial kinetics of porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose (g), galactose (gal), l-lactic acid (la) and amino-n (an) were studied in the piglet after the ingestion of 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) sporolactobacillus p44 (sp), or 10(6) cfu bacillus cereus ip5832 (ac), or 10(6) cfu of a combination of  lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis (ab)/g feed. sixteen fistulated piglets (portal vein and brachiocephalic trunk; mean body weight 22 (sd 2) kg) were used. the diet was based on skimmed milk (320 g/kg), barley (300  g/kg), wheat bran (110 g/kg), maize (100 g/kg) and lactose (70 g/kg). the postprandial blood kinetics, four measurements per animal at 1-week intervals, were studied for 6 h after the ingestion of test meals of 400 g basal diet (bd) or this diet supplemented with the bacteria (sp, ac and ab respectively). areas of porto-arterial concentration differences (apacd) of g, gal and la were not influenced by the bacteria supplements. apacd of an was significantly higher after the ingestion of the sp diet than that estimated for bd.

TI  == reaction of woodward's reagent k with d-xylose isomerases. modification of an active site carboxylate residue.
AB  == d-xylose isomerases from streptomyces violaceoruber, streptomyces sp., lactobacillus xylosus, lactobacillus brevis and bacillus coagulans were rapidly inactivated by woodward's reagent k. second-order rate constants in the absence of ligands, at ph 6.0 and 25 degrees c, were 41, 36, 22, 95 and 26 m-1.min-1 respectively. spectral analysis at 340 nm revealed that inactivation was correlated with modification of five, six, two, three and six carboxylate residues per monomer respectively. in the presence of protecting ligands, modification of one carboxylate group was prevented. the results support the idea of an active site glutamate or aspartate group that may contribute to the catalytic activity of all these d-xylose isomerases.

TI  == [spoilage microorganisms encountered in ultra-high temperature processed milk].
AB  == 40 strains of aerobic or facultative anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from  a total of 37 spoiled ultra high temperature processed milk. 13 of them were identified as the genus bacillus. they were 6 b. cereus, 5 b. licheniformis, 1 b. brevis and 1 b. pumilus. the other 27 strains were nonsporeforming microorganisms, which included 5 yeasts, 2 pseudomonas sp., 3 streptococcus sp.,  12 lactobacillus sp., 1 shigella sp., 1 aeromonas sp. and 3 micrococcus sp. results indicate that the spoilage of milk sample was caused mainly by the contamination during the filling operation. the bacillus strains isolated were mesophilic or thermophilic, and some of them, were also psychrotrophic.
