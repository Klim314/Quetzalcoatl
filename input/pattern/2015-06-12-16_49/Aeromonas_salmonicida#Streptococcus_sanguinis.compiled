TI  - Ovarian hydrobursitis in female camels (Camelus dromedaries): biochemical, bacterial and protozoal evaluation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate female camels affected with ovarian hydrobursitis (n = 31) for hematological and biochemical findings and for bacterial and protozoal infections. Blood samples were obtained and surgical ablation of the affected bursa was performed. Bursal fluid, follicular fluid, and serum were subjected to hormonal and biochemical analyses. Bursal fluids were cultured and colonies were identified using BioMerieux Vitek two compact system. Passive haemagglutination test was used for detection of Trypanosoma evansi. Indirect ELISA technique was carried out for detection of anti-Hydatid cysts anti-bodies. Neutrophilia was found in the affected animals (P = 0.01) with tendencies for monocytosis (P = 0.06) and eosinophelia (P = 0.05). Bursal fluid had a tendency for high estradiol-17beta concentration compared to blood serum (P = 0.07). Progesterone and cholesterol concentrations were similar in bursal fluid, follicular fluid and serum. Total protein, phosphorus, and magnesium concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) in the bursal fluid than in serum. Oligella urethralis, Alloiococcus otitis, Granulicatella adicens, Escherichia coli, Sphingobacterium thalpophilum, Streptococcus sanguinis, Aeromonas salmonicida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus hominis, and Rhizobium radiobacter were isolated from 46.7% of bursal fluids. T. evansi was positive in 9.7% of cases. None were positive for hydatid cyst. Accordingly, we suggest that the ovarian hydrobursitis syndrome is initially an inflammatory process and the accumulated bursal fluid is partially originated from follicular fluid.
