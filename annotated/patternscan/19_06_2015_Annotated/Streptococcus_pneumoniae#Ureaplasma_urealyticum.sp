TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the national institutes of health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == we examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. the following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a croatian translation of the nih cpsi questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and stamey localization technique). patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in croatia. an infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), enterococcus in 36 (19%) and escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. in the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: ureaplasma urealyticum, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by e. coli and enterococcus (p<0.001). clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by c. trachomatis, enterococcus and e. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by t. vaginalis.

TI  == simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated in cases of pertussis-like syndrome].
AB  == objective: to describe the etiologic study of the pertussis-like syndrome, not only as far as bordetella genus is concerned but also regarding the causative role of other microorganisms for a 11-year period (1988-1998). methods: in all specimens from patients suffering from pertussis-like cough the presence of bordetella spp., other bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma was investigated. the analysed data included microbiological findings and epidemiologic issues (age, sex, hospital admission area, yearly distribution and seasonal period). results:  a total of 1,063 specimens were investigated, most of them nasopharyngeal aspirates (910), corresponding to 905 patients; a positive culture was obtained form 56.9 of these patients. b. pertussis was isolated from 10.5% of patients. as for other bacteria, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated, in 16.9% and 15.8% of occasions, respectively. the respiratory syncitial virus was isolated from 10.7% of patients and other viruses in 9.4%. among mycoplasma, ureaplasma urealyticum predominated, with a recovery rate of 2.9%. the male/female ratio was 495/410; the ages of 67.2% of patients ranged from 0 to 6 months; a total of 689 (76.1%) required hospital admission. the recovery of b. pertussis and adenoviruses predominated during spring and summer months. in contrast, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and respiratory syncitial virus were recovered more frequently during winter months. conclusions: most patients with pertussis-like syndrome are children aged less than 6 months. the recovery percentages of b. pertussis and respiratory syncitial virus are identical and therefore we think that the investigation of their presence in this syndrome is fully warranted as well as the search for other microorganisms, since clinical symptoms are commonly non-specific among infants.

TI  == sequencing multimegabase-template dna with bigdye terminator chemistry.
AB  == using the recently introduced bigdye terminators, large-template dna can be directly sequenced with custom primers on automated instruments. cycle sequencing conditions are presented to sequence dna samples isolated from a number of microbial genomes including 750-kb ureaplasma urealyticum, 1.2-mb mycoplasma fermentans, 2.3-mb streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4.6-mb escherichia coli. average read lengths of >700 bp from unique primer annealing sites are often sufficient to fill final gaps in microbial genome sequencing projects without additional manipulations of template dna. the technique can also be applied to sequence-targeted regions, thereby bypassing tedious subcloning steps.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) was very active against gram-negative species examined  including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp., neisseria spp. and escherichia coli (mic90s < or = 0.03 mg/l). in general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative species. trovafloxacin was active against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90s < or = 0.25  mg/l). against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. in addition, chlamydia  spp., mycoplasma spp. and ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.

TI  == history of macrolide use in pediatrics.
AB  == erythromycin, the prototypical macrolide, has been widely used since the 1950s in the management of pediatric infections. erythromycin is the drug of choice for infants and children with legionnaire's disease, pertussis, diphtheria, lower respiratory tract infections caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and chlamydia trachomatis and enteritis caused by campylobacter jejuni. it is also indicated for treatment of syphilis; for streptococcal, staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections; genital infections caused by ureaplasma urealyticum; and for the prevention of rheumatic fever and endocarditis in patients who are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. the new macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are also active against borrelia burgdorferi, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, cryptosporidium spp. and toxoplasma gondii. erythromycin is associated with a low risk of serious side effects, although gastric distress occurs in a significant proportion of patients. drug interactions with theophylline, carbamazepine, warfarin, cyclosporine, terfenadine and digoxin limit erythromycin use. the newer macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are more stable, better absorbed and better tolerated than erythromycin. azithromycin is more active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae. excellent tissue and intracellular penetration may contribute to their clinical efficacy. in children both azithromycin and clarithromycin are indicated for acute otitis media caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis and for pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes. (as of december, 1996,  azithromycin for oral suspension was approved for community-acquired pneumonia in children caused by c. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m. pneumoniae and s. pneumoniae.) claritromycin is also indicated for acute maxillary sinusitis, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia and disseminated mycobacterial infections. azithromycin and clarithromycin are associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, a low rate of drug discontinuation caused by side effects and a low potential for interaction with other drugs.

TI  == the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  == tetracycline resistance genes of the m class, tet(m), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. by comparing the sequences of eight different tet(m) genes (from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, and neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. the two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and  a different g/c content. the block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(m) locus. unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(m) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the  species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(m) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.

TI  == unique susceptibility of patients with antibody deficiency to mycoplasma infection.
AB  == patients with congenital or acquired disorders of antibody production suffer from a wide variety of infections. they are most often bacterial and due to haemophilus influenzae or streptococcus pneumoniae. chronic pulmonary disease accounts for most of the deaths. while non-urogenital tract infections due to ureaplasma urealyticum or other mycoplasmas are unusual in individuals with normal resistance, patients with antibody deficiency demonstrate a unique susceptibility. with increasing frequency, patients with impaired humoral immunity have been shown to have a mycoplasmal infection that results in pneumonitis, sinusitis, cystitis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, or cellulitis. the mycoplasmas may be responsible for chronic sinopulmonary disease in a majority of such patients. awareness of the role these organisms play in causing infection in antibody-deficient patients and the institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy will contribute to an improvement in clinical outcome.

TI  == genus- and species-specific identification of mycoplasmas by 16s rrna amplification.
AB  == systematic computer alignment of mycoplasmal 16s rrna sequences allowed the identification of variable regions with both genus- and species-specific sequences. species-specific sequences of mycoplasma collis were elucidated by asymmetric amplification and dideoxynucleotide sequencing of variable regions, using primers complementary to conserved regions of 16s rrna. primers selected for mycoplasma pneumoniae, m. hominis, m. fermentans, ureaplasma urealyticum, m.  pulmonis, m. arthritidis, m. neurolyticum, m. muris, and m. collis proved to be species specific in the polymerase chain reaction. the genus-specific primers reacted with all mycoplasmal species investigated as well as with members of the  genera ureaplasma, spiroplasma, and acholeplasma. no cross-reaction was observed  with members of the closely related genera streptococcus, lactobacillus, bacillus, and clostridium or with any other microorganism tested. on the basis of the high copy number of rrna, a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction assay  was developed in which the nucleic acid content equivalent to a single organism could be detected.

TI  == culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  == to determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. ureaplasma urealyticum (t-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in  the last 31 of the patients in this series. of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with  abnormal analyses. fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for u. urealyticum. in reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution  was the same regardless of the presence or absence of u. urealyticum. antibiotic  treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients  despite conversion to a negative culture. cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. there were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.
