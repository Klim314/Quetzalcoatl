TI  - Resistance to acidic environments of caries-associated bacteria: Bifidobacterium  dentium and Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - Oral Bifidobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium dentium and Bifidobacterium longum, are  known to be isolated together with mutans streptococci and lactobacilli from caries lesions, suggesting that these Bifidobacteriaceae are caries associated and acid resistant. This study aimed to investigate effects of acidification on B. dentium and B. longum, and to compare them with those on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus paracasei. Effects of acidification, growth ability in a complex medium at a pH of 4.0-8.0, cell viability in 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid monohydrate (MES)-KOH buffer at pH 4.0, as well as stability of intracellular pH (pH(in)) at an extracellular pH of 3.5-8.0 estimated using a fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester in MES-KOH, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-KOH or N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine-KOH buffer, were investigated. B. longum grew as well as Streptococcus strains over a wide pH range, whereas B. dentium grew best in the narrow pH range around neutral. The cell viability of B. dentium decreased significantly after 2 h of acidification at a pH of 4.0, but this was significantly less than that of the Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species, whereas B. longum maintained almost 100% viability. The pH(in) was close to the extracellular pH at pH of 5.5-7.5 in the Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus strains, while at a pH of <5.0, the pH(in) was higher than the extracellular pH in all the strains, but the pH(in) maintenance ability of Bifidobacterium strains was higher than that of the Streptococcus strains. The high survival rate and pH(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacteria comparable to that of S. mutans in the acidic environment may account for why bifidobacteria exist as stable species in acidic caries lesions together with mutans streptococci.
TI  - [Protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  - Microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific IgA1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. Microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. Nonspecific proteolytic activity was found in the following microorganisms: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Aerococcus viridans, Bifidobacterium longum, Neisseria subflave, Streptococcus parvulus, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Lactobaccilus catenoforme, Bacillus spp. Specific IgA1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards IgG was found in Streptococcus acidominimus, Streptococcus hansenii, Streptococcus salivarius, Leptotrychia buccalis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Neisseria sicca. No proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of Eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), Prevotella buccalis, Aerococcus viridans and Streptococcus sanguis.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
