TI  - Manipulating the gut microbiota to maintain health and treat disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota composition varies between healthy and diseased individuals for numerous diseases. Although any cause or effect relationship between the alterations in the gut microbiota and disease is not always clear, targeting the intestinal microbiota might offer new possibilities for prevention and/or treatment of disease. OBJECTIVE: Here we review some examples of manipulating the intestinal microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants. RESULTS: Prebiotics are best known for their ability to increase the number of bifidobacteria. However, specific prebiotics could potentially also stimulate other species they can also stimulate other species associated with health, like Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcus bromii, the Roseburia/Enterococcus rectale group, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Probiotics have beneficial health effects for different diseases and digestive symptoms. These effects can be due to the direct effect of the probiotic bacterium or its products itself, as well as effects of the probiotic on the resident microbiota. Probiotics can influence the microbiota composition as well as the activity of the resident microbiota. Fecal microbial transplants are a drastic intervention in the gut microbiota, aiming for total replacement of one microbiota by another. With numerous successful studies related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection, the potential of fecal microbial transplants to treat other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic and cardiovascular disorders is under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Improved knowledge on the specific role of gut microbiota in prevention and treatment of disease will help more targeted manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. Further studies are necessary to see the (long term) effects for health of these interventions.
TI  - Fecal transplantation treatment of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis and  long-term microbiota follow-up.
AB  - Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and is considered as a treatment for other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We followed up the relief of symptoms and long-term, over-a-year microbiota stabilization in a 46-year-old man, who underwent FMT for antibiotic-induced, non-CDI colitis nine months after being treated for CDI by FMT. Fecal and mucosal microbiota was analyzed before the second FMT and during 14 months after FMT by using a high-throughput phylogenetic microarray. FMT resolved the symptoms and restored normal GI-function. Microbiota analysis revealed increased bacterial diversity in the rectal mucosa and a stable fecal microbiota up to three months after FMT. A number of mucosa-associated bacteria increased after FMT and some of these bacteria remained increased in feces up to 14 months. Notably, the increased bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (UC), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of UC. METHODS: The fecal microbiota of 30 UC samples obtained from 15 patients who were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. RESULTS: The fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with UC and the control subjects (P = 0.0004). UC-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with UC. Significant reduction of bacterial diversity of members of the Clostridium cluster IV and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including Ruminococcus bromii et rel. Eubacterium rectale et rel., Roseburia sp., and Akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in UC. Increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including Fusobacterium sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., Helicobacter sp., and Campylobacter sp. as well as Clostridium difficile were found to be associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Dysbiosis in UC is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. The microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
