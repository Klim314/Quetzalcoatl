TI  == [gut translocation septicemia in infant].
AB  == intestinal microbiotype necessary for life is a source of complications in childhood. bacterial translocation is responsible of endogenous septicaemia and invasive complications. we report five cases of severe invasive infections associated with diarrhoea, digestive bleeding or sepsis. biological parameters for inflammation are highly positive, and blood cultures reveal bacterial identification: salmonella enteridis, enterobacter cloacae, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli or clostridium difficile. we describe the predisposing factors and susceptibility status to develop translocation: invasive diarrhoea, asplenia, gasto-intestinal disease... all invasive infections in children require etiological approach with the possibility of an endogenous septicaemia (bacterial translocation). this approach minimises the nosocomial features undercurrent in these invasive infections, and leads also to other alternative preventive measures: antibiotic association, maintaining an enteral nutrition, pre or probiotic use, specific digestive decontamination.

TI  == device-independent, real-time identification of bacterial pathogens with a metal  oxide-based olfactory sensor.
AB  == a novel olfactory method for bacterial species identification using an electronic nose device called the mononose was developed. differential speciation of micro-organisms present in primary cultures of clinical samples could be performed by real-time identification of volatile organic compounds (vocs) produced during microbial replication. kinetic measurements show that the dynamic changes in headspace gas composition are orders of magnitude larger than the static differences at the end of fermentation. eleven different, clinically relevant bacterial species were included in this study. for each of the species,  two to eight different strains were used to take intra-species biodiversity into  account. a total of 52 different strains were measured in an incubator at 37 degrees c. the results show that the diagnostic specificities varied from 100% for clostridium difficile to 67% for enterobacter cloacae with an overall average of 87%. pathogen identification with a mononose can be achieved within 6-8 h of inoculation of the culture broths. the diagnostic specificity can be improved by  broth modification to improve the voc production of the pathogens involved.

TI  == [molecular fingerprint of bacterial communities and 16s rdna intra-species heterogeneity: a pitfall that should be considered].
AB  == molecular fingerprinting methods are currently used to study microbial communities by culture independent approaches. they are proposed as identification tool owing to the availability of rapid automated methods. the 16s rrna gene (16s rdna) is an efficient marker for bacterial identification and microbial communities analysis. however, the 16s rdna polymorphism among strains  of the same species is an underestimated pitfall of the fingerprinting approaches. aim of the study: we studied the 16s rdna variability among strains of three bacterial species of medical interest. material and methods: total dna was extracted from clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=20), clostridium difficile (n=20) and enterobacter cloacae (n=14). the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products obtained with consensus primers flanking the 16s rdna variable regions v3 and v6-v7-v8 were separated by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). dna extracted from ttge bands were sequenced and analysed. results: all the isolates of p. aeruginosa and of c. difficile displayed one single ttge band with constant migration distances suggesting that  there was no 16s rdna polymorphism among strains in these two species. oppositely, the isolates of e. cloacae gave complex ttge patterns formed by multiple bands with variable migration distances. these patterns corresponded to  16s rrna genes variable in a single genome as well as among strains of the species. conclusion: intra-species and/or intragenomic variability of 16s rdna should be taken into account for pertinent interpretation of molecular fingerprint. for this purpose, a comprehensive description of the polymorphism of this marker is necessary.

TI  == effect of tigecycline on normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora.
AB  == antibacterial agents disrupt the ecological balance of the normal human microflora. tigecycline, a member of a new class of antibiotics (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have a potent broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the aim of the study was to investigate the ecological effects of tigecycline on the normal oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora of healthy subjects. thirteen healthy white subjects (six females and seven males) between 20 and 31 years of age received 100 mg of tigecycline in the morning on day 1 as a 30-min intravenous infusion followed by a 50-mg dose of tigecycline every 12 h as a 30-minute infusion for 10 days. one subject was withdrawn on day 2 because of an adverse event (urticaria). serum, saliva, and fecal samples were collected before, during, and after administration for microbiological cultivation and for assays of tigecycline. all new colonizing bacteria were tested for susceptibility (resistance of > or =8 mg/liter) during the investigation period. the fecal concentrations on day 8 were from 3.0 to 14.1 mg/kg, with a mean value of 6.0 mg/kg and a median value of 5.6 mg/kg. the saliva concentrations were generally low (0 to 0.12 mg/liter). a minor effect on the oropharyngeal microflora was observed. the numbers of enterococci and escherichia coli cells in the intestinal microflora were reduced at day 8 (p < 0.05), while those of other enterobacteria  and yeasts increased. there was a marked reduction of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (p < 0.05) but no impact on bacteroides. no clostridium difficile  strains were isolated. two klebsiella pneumoniae strains and five enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to tigecycline were found on day 8.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of bms-181139, a new carbapenem with potent antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == the in vitro activities of the carbapenem bms-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. bms-181139 was the most active against species of pseudomonas and related genera alteromonas and burkholderia, with mics for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. of 22 imipenem-resistant (mic > 8 micrograms/ml) p. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an mic of bms-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem mic. bms-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, bms-18139 mics at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. bms-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except clostridium difficile. inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens but  not escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus. bms-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. bms-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the mic for some strains and up to four to eight times the mic for others. the postantibiotic effect of bms-181139 was equal to or less  than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. bms-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.

TI  == [effect of meropenem on fecal flora in children].
AB  == meropenem (mepm, sm-7338), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined for its effect on intestinal flora in children. seven children with infectious diseases (3 male and 4 female children of age's ranging from 4 months to 8 years  and 9 months weighing from 7.3 to 23.0 kg) were treated with mepm at doses ranging 10.3 to 40.5 mg/kg 3 or 4 times a day for 6 to 12 days. before, during and after the treatment, identities and numbers of various bacteria contained in  1 g of feces were determined and fecal beta-lactamase activity and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. changes in fecal flora during mepm treatment was somewhat different depending on cases. regarding enterobacteriaceae among aerobes, all of 7 cases exhibited moderate or pronounced reductions in escherichia coli. some of the cases exhibited the tendency to increase in klebsiella oxytoca. enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. e. coli which  was reduced during the treatment increased rapidly after the treatment in 5 out of 7 cases, and the initial bacterial counts were restored. diverse strains were  observed within the genus enterococcus, while the overall bacterial counts of this genus exhibited the tendency to increase during the treatment. as a result,  no significant change in total aerobe count was observed in any case except 1 case where enterococcus count was somewhat reduced. among anaerobes, major bacteria such as bacteroides, bifidobacterium, eubacterium and peptococcaceae exhibited tendencies to decrease in some cases during the antibiotic treatment. two infants and 1 child exhibited significant decreases in total anaerobe counts. in most of the cases, such changes in major anaerobes were transient and bacterial counts recovered to their initial values rapidly after completion of the treatment. in no cases, glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungus became predominant. although c. difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 4 cases, its changes had no relationship with characteristics of feces. c. difficile was not detected in any of the cases. mepm was detected in feces in 4 cases being treatment, in concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 66.0 micrograms/g.  fecal mepm levels were very low except in 1 case in which beta-lactamase was negative. from these results, effects of mepm on intestinal flora in children were relatively minor compared to other new beta-lactam drugs. however, a care should be taken to minimize diarrhea and bacterial turnover when a prolonged use  of the antibiotic, was practiced because of potential significant effects on intestinal flora.

TI  == effect of ceftazidime and gentamicin on the oropharyngeal and faecal flora of patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  == thirty-four patients with haematological malignancies were studied to investigate the effect of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (ceftazidime and gentamicin) on the gastro-intestinal flora. twenty-five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or post-autologous bone-marrow transplantation were given framycetin, nystatin and colistin (fracon), and two patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma were on co-trimoxazole, as long-term gut prophylaxis. semi-quantitative  microbiology was carried out on oropharyngeal swabs and quantitative microbiology on faecal specimens. the oropharyngeal flora consisted mainly of streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci and coryneforms, and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. a strain of enterobacter cloacae resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin colonized one patient, who later developed septicaemia. the faecal flora of patients on fracon was dominated by enterococci; the few enterobacteria  present were eliminated by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the anaerobic flora was absent in 15% of patients; in the remainder, it consisted mainly of bacteroides spp., and was little affected by ceftazidime/gentamicin. the faecal flora of patients not on fracon always contained anaerobes, and some strains of enterobacteria persisted throughout antibiotic treatment. none of the patients was colonized by  clostridium difficile or pseudomonas aeruginosa. broad-spectrum therapy with ceftazidime and gentamicin appeared to have little effect on the gastro-intestinal flora, except to encourage the overgrowth of enterococci and reduce the numbers of enterobacteria.

TI  == ceftazidime in patients with pseudomonas infections.
AB  == ceftazidime was administered to 41 patients with serious infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 cases) and other bacteria (17 cases). the clinical response rate of pseudomonas infections (88%) was similar to that of other bacteria (94%) with microbiological eradication of 83% of initial pseudomonas isolates compared to 82% of non-pseudomonas strains. the development of resistance to ceftazidime during therapy was observed in 3 cases (enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, and ps. aeruginosa), and superinfection by a resistant enterobacter agglomerans occurred in one case. adverse reactions of clinical significance included two cases of leukopenia and one case each of azotaemia, diarrhoea (clostridium difficile toxin positive), and rash.
