TI  - Cyclic Rhamnosylated Elongation Factor P Establishes Antibiotic Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Elongation factor P (EF-P) is a ubiquitous bacterial protein that is required for the synthesis of poly-proline motifs during translation. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, the posttranslational beta-lysylation of Lys34 by the PoxA protein is critical for EF-P activity. PoxA is absent from many bacterial species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, prompting a search for alternative EF-P posttranslation modification pathways. Structural analyses of P. aeruginosa EF-P revealed the attachment of a single cyclic rhamnose moiety to an Arg residue at a position equivalent to that at which beta-Lys is attached to E. coli EF-P. Analysis of the genomes of organisms that both lack poxA and encode an Arg32-containing EF-P revealed a highly conserved glycosyltransferase (EarP) encoded at a position adjacent to efp. EF-P proteins isolated from P. aeruginosa DeltaearP, or from a DeltarmlC::acc1 strain deficient in dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthesis, were unmodified. In vitro assays confirmed the ability of EarP to use dTDP-l-rhamnose as a substrate for the posttranslational glycosylation of EF-P. The role of rhamnosylated EF-P in translational control was investigated in P. aeruginosa using a Pro4-green fluorescent protein (Pro4GFP) in vivo reporter assay, and the fluorescence was significantly reduced in Deltaefp, DeltaearP, and DeltarmlC::acc1 strains. DeltarmlC::acc1, DeltaearP, and Deltaefp strains also displayed significant increases in their sensitivities to a range of antibiotics, including ertapenem, polymyxin B, cefotaxim, and piperacillin. Taken together, our findings indicate that posttranslational rhamnosylation of EF-P plays a key role in P. aeruginosa gene expression and survival. IMPORTANCE: Infections with pathogenic Salmonella, E. coli, and Pseudomonas isolates can all lead to infectious disease with potentially fatal sequelae. EF-P proteins contribute to the pathogenicity of the causative agents of these and other diseases by controlling the translation of proteins critical for modulating antibiotic resistance, motility, and other traits that play key roles in establishing virulence. In Salmonella spp. and E. coli, the attachment of beta-Lys is required for EF-P activity, but the proteins required for this posttranslational modification pathway are absent from many organisms. Instead, bacteria such as P. aeruginosa activate EF-P by posttranslational modification with rhamnose, revealing a new role for protein glycosylation that may also prove useful as a target for the development of novel antibiotics.
TI  - Association with pathogenic bacteria affects life-history traits and population growth in Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - Determining the relationship between individual life-history traits and population dynamics is an essential step to understand and predict natural selection. Model organisms that can be conveniently studied experimentally at both levels are invaluable to test the rich body of theoretical literature in this area. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, despite being a well-established workhorse in genetics, has only recently received attention from ecologists and evolutionary biologists, especially with respect to its association with pathogenic bacteria. In order to start filling the gap between the two areas, we conducted a series of experiments aiming at measuring life-history traits as well as population growth of C. elegans in response to three different bacterial strains: Escherichia coli OP50, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Whereas previous studies had established that the latter two reduced the survival of nematodes feeding on them compared to E. coli OP50, we report for the first time an enhancement in reproductive success and population growth for worms feeding on S. enterica Typhimurium. Furthermore, we used an age-specific population dynamic model, parameterized using individual life-history assays, to successfully predict the growth of populations over three generations. This study paves the way for more detailed and quantitative experimental investigation of the ecology and evolution of C. elegans and the bacteria it interacts with, which could improve our understanding of the fate of opportunistic pathogens in the environment.
TI  - Photodynamic Inactivation Mediated by Erythrosine and its Derivatives on Foodborne Pathogens and Spoilage Bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) mediated by erythrosine (ERY) and its ester derivatives erythrosine methyl ester (ERYMET) and erythrosine butyl ester (ERYBUT) on foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria. We evaluated Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The toxicity of all of the compounds was assessed in VERO cells. PDI mediated by ERY and its derivatives combined with a light-emitting diode was performed at different concentrations and exposure times. S. aureus was more photosensitive than Gram-negative bacteria to ERY, ERYMET, and ERYBUT. The ERY-mediated PDI of S. aureus induced a significant reduction of 4.0 log CFU/ml at a light dose of 40 J/cm2. ERYMET and ERYBUT at lower light doses than ERY completely eradicated S. aureus. When photoirradiated with ERY at light doses of 156 and 234 J/cm2, A. hydrophila was completely eradicated. ERYBUT was more efficient in the PDI of A. hydrophila than ERYMET, even at 1 x 10-5 M and lower light doses. Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa required higher concentrations of photosensitizers to reduce cell survival. ERYBUT and ERY may be promising photosensitizing agents against A. hydrophila and S. aureus. They were effective at reducing bacterial counts at nontoxic concentrations. The photoinactivation rate of the evaluated bacteria decreased in the following order: S. aureus > A. hydrophila > E. coli > S. Typhimurium > P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Molecular survey of occurrence and quantity of Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and amoeba hosts in municipal drinking water storage tank sediments.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the occurrence and quantity of potential pathogens and an indicator of microbial contamination in the sediments of municipal drinking water storage tanks (MDWSTs), given the absence of such data across the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sediment samples (87 MDWST) from eighteen locations across ten states of the United States were collected and assayed by qPCR for a range of potential enteric and opportunistic microbial pathogens and a sewage-associated Bacteroides marker. Potential opportunistic pathogens dominated, with the highest detection of occurrence (per cent positive detection; average cell equivalence (CE)) being Mycobacterium spp. (88.9%; 6.7 +/- 8.5 x 104 CE g-1 ), followed by Legionella spp. (66.7%; 5.2 +/- 5.9 x 103 CE g-1 ), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%; 250 +/- 880 CE g-1 ) and Acanthamoeba spp. (38.9%; 53 +/- 70 CE g-1 ), with no detected Naegleria fowleri. Most enteric pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis) were not detected, except for a trace signal for Campylobacter spp. There was significant correlation between the qPCR signals of Legionella spp. and Acanthamoeba spp. (R2 = 0.61, n = 87, P = 0.0001). Diverse Legionella spp. including Leg. pneumophila, Leg. pneumophila sg1 and Leg. anisa were identified, each of which might cause legionellosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that potential opportunistic pathogens are common within MDWST sediments and could act as a source of microbial contamination, but need downstream growth to be of potential concern. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results imply that opportunistic pathogen risks may need to be managed by regular tank cleaning or other management practices.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Extracellular zinc induces phosphoethanolamine addition to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipid A via the ColRS two-component system.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria survive harmful environmental stressors by modifying their outer membrane. Much of this protection is afforded upon remodeling of the lipid A region of the major surface molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For example, the addition of cationic substituents, such as 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) and phosphoehthanolamine (pEtN) at the lipid A phosphate groups, is often induced in response to specific environmental flux stabilizing the outer membrane. The work herein represents the first report of pEtN addition to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipid A. We have identified the key pEtN transferase which we named EptAPa and characterized its strict activity on only one position of lipid A, contrasting from previously studied EptA enzymes. We further show that transcription of eptAP a is regulated by zinc via the ColRS two-component system instead of the PmrAB system responsible for eptA regulation in E. coli and Salmonella enterica. Further, although L-Ara4N is readily added to the same position of lipid A as pEtN under certain environmental conditions, ColR specifically induces pEtN addition to lipid A in lieu of L-Ara4N when Zn2+ is present. The unique, specific regulation of eptAP a transcription and enzymatic activity described in this work demonstrates the tight yet inducible control over LPS modification in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to Triton X-100 treatment.
AB  - Mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. We have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. Adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with Triton X-100. In this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal strains was investigated. Mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. Bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with Triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. Mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log CFU/mL higher plate counts of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. The sensitivity of bacteria to Triton varied among microbial species and strains. Among others, Triton inhibited the growth of Salmonella enterica LMG 10396 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. Only Gram-positive strains, Enterococcus hirae LMG 6399 and L. rhamnosus GG, were not affected by this detergent. Therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to Triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. However, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered L. rhamnosus GG compared to the chemical extraction.
TI  - The expression of propionicin PLG-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
AB  - Propionicin PLG-1 is a bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium thoenii P127. Such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of Corynebacterium sp. In the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin PLG-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. The PCR product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (LAB) strains using pLEB590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector pLEBPLG-1. LAB transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against Esch. coli DH5alpha (most affected strain), Listeria monocytogenes 18116, and Salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. Such LAB transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.
TI  - The N terminus of type III secretion needle protein YscF from Yersinia pestis functions to modulate innate immune responses.
AB  - The type III secretion system is employed by many pathogens, including the genera Yersinia, Shigella, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella, to deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. The injectisome needle is formed by the polymerization of a single protein, e.g., YscF (Yersinia pestis), PscF (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), PrgI (Salmonella enterica SPI-1), SsaG (Salmonella enterica SPI-2), or MxiH (Shigella flexneri). In this study, we demonstrated that the N termini of some needle proteins, particularly the N terminus of YscF from Yersinia pestis, influences host immune responses. The N termini of several needle proteins were truncated and tested for the ability to induce inflammatory responses in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells). Truncated needle proteins induced proinflammatory cytokines to different magnitudes than the corresponding wild-type proteins, except SsaG. Notably, N-terminally truncated YscF induced significantly higher activation of NF-kappaB and/or AP-1 and higher induction of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that a function of the N terminus of YscF is interference with host sensing of YscF, consistent with Y. pestis pathogenesis. To directly test the ability of the N terminus of YscF to suppress cytokine induction, a YscF-SsaG chimera with 15 N-terminal amino acids from YscF added to SsaG was constructed. The chimeric YscF-SsaG induced lower levels of cytokines than wild-type SsaG. However, the addition of 15 random amino acids to SsaG had no effect on NF-kappaB/AP-1 activation. These results suggest that the N terminus of YscF can function to decrease cytokine induction, perhaps contributing to a favorable immune environment leading to survival of Y. pestis within the eukaryotic host.
TI  - Development of a protocol for predicting bacterial resistance to microbicides.
AB  - Regulations dealing with microbicides in Europe and the United States are evolving and now require data on the risk of the development of resistance in organisms targeted by microbicidal products. There is no standard protocol to assess the risk of the development of resistance to microbicidal formulations. This study aimed to validate the use of changes in microbicide and antibiotic susceptibility as initial markers for predicting microbicide resistance and cross-resistance to antibiotics. Three industrial isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains (SL1344 and 14028S) were exposed to a shampoo, a mouthwash, eye makeup remover, and the microbicides contained within these formulations (chlorhexidine digluconate [CHG] and benzalkonium chloride [BZC]) under realistic, in-use conditions. Baseline and postexposure data were compared. No significant increases in the MIC or the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were observed for any strain after exposure to the three formulations. Increases as high as 100-fold in the MICs and MBCs of CHG and BZC for SL1344 and 14028S were observed but were unstable. Changes in antibiotic susceptibility were not clinically significant. The use of MICs and MBCs combined with antibiotic susceptibility profiling and stability testing generated reproducible data that allowed for an initial prediction of the development of resistance to microbicides. These approaches measure characteristics that are directly relevant to the concern over resistance and cross-resistance development following the use of microbicides. These are low-cost, high-throughput techniques, allowing manufacturers to provide to regulatory bodies, promptly and efficiently, data supporting an early assessment of the risk of resistance development.
TI  - Bacterial flagella: twist and stick, or dodge across the kingdoms.
AB  - The flagellum organelle is an intricate multiprotein assembly best known for its  rotational propulsion of bacteria. However, recent studies have expanded our knowledge of other functions in pathogenic contexts, particularly adherence and immune modulation, e.g., for Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Flagella-mediated adherence is important in host colonisation for several plant and animal pathogens, but the specific interactions that promote flagella binding to such diverse host tissues has remained elusive. Recent work has shown that the organelles act like probes that find favourable surface topologies to initiate binding. An emerging theme is that more general properties, such as ionic charge of repetitive binding epitopes and rotational force, allow interactions with plasma membrane components. At the same time, flagellin monomers are important inducers of plant and animal innate immunity: variation in their recognition impacts the course and outcome of infections in hosts from both kingdoms. Bacteria have evolved different strategies to evade or even promote this specific recognition, with some important differences shown for phytopathogens. These studies have provided a wider appreciation of the functions of bacterial flagella in the context of both plant and animal reservoirs.
TI  - Chemical Assessment and Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activities of Endophytic Fungi Extracts Isolated from Costus spiralis (Jacq.) Roscoe (Costaceae).
AB  - Costus spiralis (Costaceae) is a species native to the Amazon region and is used  in traditional medicine. The endophytic fungi used in this study were obtained from leaves of this plant. 13 strains were selected to obtain hydroethanolic extracts and were submitted to hydroalcoholic extraction and evaluated for antioxidant activity by DPPH (2,2-difenil-1-picrilhidrazil) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power), and all of the fungi had positive results. The antimicrobial action of crude extracts had a good range of activities. All extracts had inhibitory activities against the yeasts of Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis, with 125 to 500 mug/mL MIC. Eight extracts had antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis (MIC from 62.4 to 125 mug/mL), 5 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC from 125 to 500 mug/mL), 2 against Salmonella enterica (MIC from 125 to 62.5 mug/mL), and 2 against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC from 500 to 125 mug/mL). The presence of secondary metabolites, including coumarins, was observed during chemical evaluation by thin layer chromatography. Total phenol content was estimated, and a strong positive correlation to antioxidant activity was observed, according to its Pearson coefficient. This is the first report of the bioactive potential of endophytic fungi isolated from the Costaceae family in Brazilian ecosystems.
TI  - Energetics of pathogenic bacteria and opportunities for drug development.
AB  - The emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens and our inability to develop new antimicrobials to overcome resistance has inspired scientists to consider new targets for drug development. Cellular bioenergetics is an area showing promise for the development of new antimicrobials, particularly in the discovery of new anti-tuberculosis drugs where several new compounds have entered clinical trials. In this review, we have examined the bioenergetics of various bacterial pathogens, highlighting the versatility of electron donor and acceptor utilisation and the modularity of electron transport chain components in bacteria. In addition to re-examining classical concepts, we explore new literature that reveals the intricacies of pathogen energetics, for example, how Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni exploit host and microbiota to derive powerful electron donors and sinks; the strategies Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa use to persist in lung tissues; and the importance of sodium energetics and electron bifurcation in the chemiosmotic anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum. A combination of physiological, biochemical, and pharmacological data suggests that, in addition to the clinically-approved target F1Fo-ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase type II, succinate dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, cytochrome bd oxidase, and menaquinone biosynthesis pathways are particularly promising next-generation drug targets. The realisation of cellular energetics as a rich target space for the development of new antimicrobials will be dependent upon gaining increased understanding of the energetic processes utilised by pathogens in host environments and the ability to design bacterial-specific inhibitors of these processes.
TI  - The question of pathogen quantification in disinfected graywater.
AB  - Graywater (GW) reuse for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One of the major impediments to GW reuse is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. This study monitored three similar on-site GW treatment systems bi-monthly over the course of a year to compare the presence of pathogens and indicators in raw, biologically treated, and biologically treated and disinfected [by chlorine and ultraviolet light (UV)] GW. The systems were designed to allow the testing of the same batch (collection) of water as it passed through the treatment chain. The samples were analyzed using standard culture-dependent methods and the data were compared to culture-independent DNA-based methods. Results suggested that the presence and abundance of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa differ among the various GW streams (e.g. raw, biologically treated, and disinfected). The culture-dependent analyses suggested that both chlorine and UV inactivate most of the bacteria tested in the biologically treated GW, albeit at different efficiencies. Conversely, the DNA-based analyses indicated no significant differences in pathogenic bacterial abundance between the biologically treated GW with or without disinfection. To better understand the discrepancies between the results, we repeated the analysis in the laboratory under controlled conditions using Enterococcus faecalis as a model bacterium and obtained similar results. We suggest that disinfection of biologically treated GW with chlorine or UV is effective for treating pathogens, but that the inactivation efficiency cannot be estimated by DNA-based qPCR.
TI  - DI-ICR-FT-MS-based high-throughput deep metabotyping: a case study of the Caenorhabditis elegans-Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model.
AB  - In metabolomics there is an ever-growing need for faster and more comprehensive analysis methods to cope with the increasing size of biological studies. Direct-infusion ion-cyclotron-resonance Fourier-transform spectrometry (DI-ICR-FT-MS) is used in non-targeted metabolomics to obtain high-resolution snapshots of the metabolic state of a system. We applied this technology to a Caenorhabditis elegans-Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model and optimized times needed for cultivation and mass-spectrometric analysis. Our results reveal that DI-ICR-FT-MS is a promising tool for high-throughput in-depth non-targeted metabolomics. We performed whole-worm metabolomics and recovered markers of the induced metabolic changes in C. elegans brought about by interaction with pathogens. In this investigation, we reveal complex metabolic phenotypes enabling clustering based upon challenge. Specifically, we observed a marked decrease in amino-acid metabolism with infection by P. aeruginosa and a marked increase in sugar metabolism with infection by Salmonella enterica. We were also able to discriminate between infection with a virulent wild-type Pseudomonas and with an attenuated mutant, making it possible to use this method in larger genetic screens to identify host and pathogen effectors affecting the metabolic phenotype of infection.
TI  - Bacterial virulence analysis using brine shrimp as an infection model in relation to the importance of quorum sensing and proteases.
AB  - Brine shrimp are aquatic crustaceans belonging to a genus of Artemia. This organism is widely used for testing the toxicity of chemicals. In this study, brine shrimp were evaluated as an infection model organism to study bacterial virulence. Artemia nauplii were infected with various pathogenic bacteria, such as Vibrio vulnificus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia vietnamiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and the susceptibility to these bacteria was investigated by counting the survival of the infected nauplii. While all of the tested bacteria have significant virulence to brine shrimp, killing the nauplii in a few days, V. vulnificus showed the strongest virulence. P. aeruginosa also showed a dose-dependent virulence to brine shrimp, but the virulence was weaker than that of V. vulnificus. The virulence tests using the virulence-attenuated mutants of V. vulnificus and P. aeruginosa, such as quorum sensing (QS) mutants or protease-deficient mutants showed a significant attenuation of virulence, demonstrating that the QS mechanism is important in the virulence of these bacteria to brine shrimp. B. vietnamiensis, S. aureus, and E. coli were also virulent to brine shrimp and the virulence was correlated with dosage within 24 h under our conditions. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis were also virulent to brine shrimp, but the virulence was weak and slowly exerted compared with that of other bacteria. Taken together, we suggest that brine shrimp are a good infection model to assay bacterial virulence, especially for V. vulnificus and P. aeruginosa, and QS is important in the bacterial virulence to brine shrimp.
TI  - Alternative fecal indicators and their empirical relationships with enteric viruses, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in surface waters of a tropical urban catchment.
AB  - The suitability of traditional microbial indicators (i.e., Escherichia coli and enterococci) has been challenged due to the lack of correlation with pathogens and evidence of possible regrowth in the natural environment. In this study, the relationships between alternative microbial indicators of potential human fecal contamination (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Methanobrevibacter smithii, human polyomaviruses [HPyVs], and F+ and somatic coliphages) and pathogens (Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, and adenovirus) were compared with those of traditional microbial indicators, as well as environmental parameters (temperature, conductivity, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total suspended solids, turbidity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus). Water samples were collected from surface waters of urban catchments in Singapore. Salmonella and P. aeruginosa had significant positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, especially E. coli and enterococci. Norovirus GII showed moderately strong positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, except for HPyVs and coliphages. In general, high geometric means and significant correlations between human-specific markers and pathogens suggest the possibility of sewage contamination in some areas. The simultaneous detection of human-specific markers (i.e., B. thetaiotaomicron, M. smithii, and HPyVs) with E. coli and enterococcus supports the likelihood of recent fecal contamination, since the human-specific markers are unable to regrow in natural surface waters. Multiple-linear-regression results further confirm that the inclusion of M. smithii and HPyVs, together with traditional indicators, would better predict the occurrence of pathogens. Further study is needed to determine the applicability of such models to different geographical locations and environmental conditions.
TI  - Monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. Monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's abdomen. Milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. Using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel Monotreme Lactation Protein (MLP) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. We show that platypus and short-beaked echidna MLP genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. The MLP transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. Analysis of recombinant MLP showed that it is an N-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that MLP is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein, a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. Functional analysis revealed MLP antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and commensal Enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Salmonella enterica. Our data suggest that MLP is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. We propose that MLP evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LpxT reveals dual positional lipid A kinase activity and co-ordinated control of outer membrane modification.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria have evolved modification machinery to promote a dynamic outer membrane in response to a continually fluctuating environment. The kinase LpxT, for example, adds a phosphate group to the lipid A moiety of some Gram-negatives including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. LpxT activity is inhibited under conditions that compromise membrane integrity, resulting instead in the addition of positively charged groups to lipid A that increase membrane stability and provide resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. We have now identified a functional lpxT orthologue in P. aeruginosa. LpxTPa has unique enzymatic characteristics, as it is able to phosphorylate P. aeruginosa lipid A at two sites of the molecule. Surprisingly, a previously uncharacterized lipid A 4'-dephospho-1-triphosphate species was detected. LpxTPa activity is inhibited by magnesium independently of lpxTPa transcription. Modulation of LpxTPa activity is influenced by transcription of the lipid A aminoarabinose transferase ArnT, known to be activated in response to limiting magnesium. These results demonstrate a divergent activity of LpxTPa , and suggest the existence of a co-ordinated regulatory mechanism that permits adaptation to a changing environment.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene.

The Salmonella LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.
TI  - Phage-host interplay: examples from tailed phages and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Complex interactions between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts play significant roles in shaping the structure of environmental microbial communities, not only by genetic transduction but also by modification of bacterial gene expression patterns. Survival of phages solely depends on their ability to infect their bacterial hosts, most importantly during phage entry. Successful dynamic adaptation of bacteriophages when facing selective pressures, such as host adaptation and resistance, dictates their abundance and diversification. Co-evolution of the phage tail fibers and bacterial receptors determine bacterial host ranges, mechanisms of phage entry, and other infection parameters. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the physical interactions between tailed bacteriophages and bacterial pathogens (e.g., Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the influences of the phage on host gene expression. Understanding these interactions can offer insights into phage-host dynamics and suggest novel strategies for the design of bacterial pathogen biological controls.
TI  - C-terminal domain swapping of SSB changes the size of the ssDNA binding site.
AB  - Single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) plays an important role in DNA metabolism, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination, and is therefore essential for cell survival. Bacterial SSB consists of an N-terminal ssDNA-binding/oligomerization domain and a flexible C-terminal protein-protein interaction domain. We characterized the ssDNA-binding properties of Klebsiella pneumoniae SSB (KpSSB), Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium LT2 SSB (StSSB), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 SSB (PaSSB), and two chimeric KpSSB proteins, namely, KpSSBnStSSBc and KpSSBnPaSSBc. The C-terminal domain of StSSB or PaSSB was exchanged with that of KpSSB through protein chimeragenesis. By using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we characterized the stoichiometry of KpSSB, StSSB, PaSSB, KpSSBnStSSBc, and KpSSBnPaSSBc, complexed with a series of ssDNA homopolymers. The binding site sizes were determined to be 26 +/- 2, 21 +/- 2, 29 +/- 2, 21 +/- 2, and 29 +/- 2 nucleotides (nt), respectively. Comparison of the binding site sizes of KpSSB, KpSSBnStSSBc, and KpSSBnPaSSBc showed that the C-terminal domain swapping of SSB changes the size of the binding site. Our observations suggest that not only the conserved N-terminal domain but also the C-terminal domain of SSB is an important determinant for ssDNA binding.
TI  - Ionic liquids as a class of materials for transdermal delivery and pathogen neutralization.
AB  - Biofilm-protected microbial infections in skin are a serious health risk that remains to be adequately addressed. The lack of progress in developing effective treatment strategies is largely due to the transport barriers posed by the stratum corneum of the skin and the biofilm. In this work, we report on the use of Ionic Liquids (ILs) for biofilm disruption and enhanced antibiotic delivery across skin layers. We outline the syntheses of ILs, analysis of relevant physicochemical properties, and subsequent neutralization effects on two biofilm-forming pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica. Further, the ILs were also examined for cytotoxicity, skin irritation, delivery of antibiotics through the skin, and treatment of biofilms in a wound model. Of the materials examined, choline-geranate emerged as a multipurpose IL with excellent antimicrobial activity, minimal toxicity to epithelial cells as well as skin, and effective permeation enhancement for drug delivery. Specifically, choline-geranate was comparable with, or more effective than, bleach treatment against established biofilms of S. enterica and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition, choline-geranate increased delivery of cefadroxil, an antibiotic, by >16-fold into the deep tissue layers of the skin without inducing skin irritation. The in vivo efficacy of choline-geranate was validated using a biofilm-infected wound model (>95% bacterial death after 2-h treatment). This work establishes the use of ILs for simultaneous enhancement of topical drug delivery and antibiotic activity.
TI  - Assessment of oligogalacturonide from citrus pectin as a potential antibacterial  agent against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Foodborne diseases are an important public health problem in the world. The bacterial resistance against presently used antibiotics is becoming a public health issue; hence, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents from natural sources attracts a lot of attention. Antibacterial activities of oligogalacturonide from commercial microbial pectic enzyme (CPE) treated citrus pectin, which exhibits antioxidant and antitumor activities, against 4 foodborne pathogens including Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed. Pectin hydrolysates from CPE hydrolysis exhibited antibacterial activities. However, no antibacterial activity of pectin was observed. Citrus oligogalacturonide from 24-h hydrolysis exhibited bactericidal effect against all selected foodborne pathogens and displayed minimal inhibitory concentration at 37.5 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa, L. monocytogenes, and S. Typhimurium, and at 150.0 mug/mL for S. aureus.
TI  - In-vitro assessment of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts and essential oil of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to the complexity of the antioxidant materials and their mechanism of actions, it is obvious that no single testing method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile. The essential oil of the Thymus specie may still possess other important activities in traditional medicine, it can be used in the treatment of fever and cough. This essential oil may also have an anticancer activity. METHODS: The essential oils aerial parts hydrodistilled from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were characterised by GC/MS analysis and the methanolic extracts were chemically characterized by HPLC method. The essence of thyme was evaluated for its antioxidant and antibacterial activity. RESULT: The Terpinen-4-ol are the principal class of metabolites (33.34%) among which 1.8-cineole (19.96%) and camphor (19.20%) predominate. In this study, quantitative values of antioxidant activity of crude methanolic extracts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis were investigated. The essential oils was screened for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteridis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes) by well diffusion method and agar dilution method (MIC). All the essences were found to inhibit the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria organisms tested. These activities were correlated with the presence of phenolic compounds in active fractions. HPLC confirmed presence of phenolic compounds in methanol extracts. CONCLUSION: Methanol extracts and essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were examined for their potential as antioxidants. The technique for measuring antioxidant activity, which was developed using DPPH, ABTS and beta-carotene bleaching, produced results as found in established literatures. The present results indicate clearly that methanol extracts and essential oils from Thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis possess antioxidant properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants, also their essential oil have an antibacterial effect.
TI  - Assembly and stability of Salmonella enterica ser. Typhi TolC protein in POPE and DMPE.
AB  - In this work we assessed the suitability of two different lipid membranes for the simulation of a TolC protein from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The TolC protein family is found in many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria including Vibrio cholera and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acts as an outer membrane channel for expulsion of drug and toxin from the cell. In S. typhi, the causative agent for typhoid fever, the TolC outer membrane protein is an antigen for the pathogen. The lipid environment is an important modulator of membrane protein structure and function. We evaluated the conformation of the TolC protein in the presence of DMPE and POPE bilayers using molecular dynamics simulation. The S. typhi TolC protein exhibited similar conformational dynamics to TolC and its homologues. Conformational flexibility of the protein is seen in the C-terminal, extracellular loops, and alpha-helical region. Despite differences in the two lipids, significant similarities in the motion of the protein in POPE and DMPE were observed, including the rotational motion of the C-terminal residues and the partially open extracellular loops. However, analysis of the trajectories demonstrated effects of hydrophobic matching of the TolC protein in the membrane, particularly in the lengthening of the lipids and subtle movements of the protein's beta-barrel towards the lower leaflet in DMPE. The study exhibited the use of molecular dynamics simulation in revealing the differential effect of membrane proteins and lipids on each other. In this study, POPE is potentially a more suitable model for future simulation of the S. typhi TolC protein.
TI  - Unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  - Biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. Even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (CDA), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. However, whether CDA has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. Here, the activity of CDA as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica and E. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. To assess the ability of CDA combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, CFU counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. Eradication of the biofilms by CDA combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. The effect of CDA combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and LIVE/DEAD staining. MICs were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of CDA combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. Treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nM CDA resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. While antibiotics or disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on CFU counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nM CDA and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm biomass. These data suggests that combined treatments with CDA would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.
TI  - A broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. Their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. Here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens. Combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. In addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced P. aeruginosa PA14 preexisting biofilms. PCR studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. Thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Spread and transmission of bacterial pathogens in experimental populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is frequently used as a model species for the study of bacterial virulence and innate immunity. In recent years, diverse mechanisms contributing to the nematode's immune response to bacterial infection have been discovered. Yet despite growing interest in the biochemical and molecular basis of nematode-bacterium associations, many questions remain about their ecology. Although recent studies have demonstrated that free-living nematodes could act as vectors of opportunistic pathogens in soil, the extent to which worms may contribute to the persistence and spread of these bacteria has not been quantified. We conducted a series of experiments to test whether colonization of and transmission between C. elegans nematodes could enable two opportunistic pathogens (Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to spread on agar plates occupied by Escherichia coli. We monitored the transmission of S. enterica and P. aeruginosa from single infected nematodes to their progeny and measured bacterial loads both within worms and on the plates. In particular, we analyzed three factors affecting the dynamics of bacteria: (i) initial source of the bacteria, (ii) bacterial species, and (iii) feeding behavior of the host. Results demonstrate that worms increased the spread of bacteria through shedding and transmission. Furthermore, we found that despite P. aeruginosa's relatively high transmission rate among worms, its pathogenic effects reduced the overall number of worms colonized. This study opens new avenues to understand the role of nematodes in the epidemiology and evolution of pathogenic bacteria in the environment.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Innate host defense requires TFEB-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes.
AB  - Animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. Understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. By using an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that HLH-30 (known as TFEB in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. TFEB was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, our data suggest that TFEB is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.
TI  - Cold-active antibacterial and antifungal activities and antibiotic resistance of  bacteria isolated from an alpine hydrocarbon-contaminated industrial site.
AB  - Selection pressure in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils may lead not only to increased microbial resistance to antibiotics, but also to increased capacity of the soil indigenous population to produce antimicrobial compounds. Therefore, we studied the antibiotic resistance pattern and antibacterial and/or antifungal activities of 47 bacterial strains isolated from an industrial alpine site heavily polluted with petroleum hydrocarbons. Resistance to penicillin was more widespread (49%) than resistance to chloramphenicol or rifampicin (28%) or streptomycin (26%). Only 9% of the strains were resistant to tetracycline. The ability to produce cold-active (10 degrees C) antimicrobial compounds was tested by using human pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) and yeasts (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans) as indicator microorganisms. About two-thirds of the 47 tested strains produced compounds that inhibited growth of at least one indicator microorganism. Six strains inhibited growth of both bacteria and yeast indicators; 12 and 16 strains showed either antibacterial or antifungal activity, respectively. The most versatile bacteria with regard to multiple antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial activity belonged to Actinobacteria or Gammaproteobacteria. The antimicrobial compounds produced by three Pseudomonas spp. and two Serratia spp. strains were characterized in more detail by TLC and HPLC. Depending on the sensitivity of growth inhibition to enzymes, the compounds produced by the three pseudomonads contained a proteinaceous component.
TI  - Effect of methylglyoxal on multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Honey has a complex chemistry, and its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity varies with floral source, climate, and harvesting conditions. Methylglyoxal was identified as the dominant antibacterial component of manuka honey. Although it has been known that methylglyoxal has antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, there is not much information describing its activity against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we report the effect of methylglyoxal against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) using 53 clinically isolated strains. We also assessed the effect of deleting the five multidrug efflux systems in P. aeruginosa, as well as the efflux systems in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, on MICs of methylglyoxal. Our results indicate that methylglyoxal inhibits the growth of MDRP at concentrations of 128-512 mug/ml (1.7-7.1 mM) and is not recognized by drug efflux systems.
TI  - Green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by Rhizopus arrhizus and Cunninghamella elegans strains.
AB  - This article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by Cunninghamella elegans and Rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). The physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. Chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and X-ray diffraction. The effectiveness of chitosan from C. elegans and R. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). The highest production of biomass (24.60 g/L), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by R. arrhizus. Chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. Both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cP and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. They both showed identical MIC and MBC for all bacteria assayed. These results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - A sequence-based approach for prediction of CsrA/RsmA targets in bacteria with experimental validation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - CsrA/RsmA homologs are an extensive family of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-binding proteins that function as global post-transcriptional regulators controlling important cellular processes such as secondary metabolism, motility, biofilm formation and the production and secretion of virulence factors in diverse bacterial species. While direct messenger RNA binding by CsrA/RsmA has been studied in detail for some genes, it is anticipated that there are numerous additional, as yet undiscovered, direct targets that mediate its global regulation. To assist in the discovery of these targets, we propose a sequence-based approach to predict genes directly regulated by these regulators. In this work, we develop a computer code (CSRA_TARGET) implementing this approach, which leads to predictions for several novel targets in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The predicted targets in other bacteria, specifically Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pectobacterium carotovorum and Legionella pneumophila, also include global regulators that control virulence in these pathogens, unraveling intricate indirect regulatory roles for CsrA/RsmA. We have experimentally validated four predicted RsmA targets in P. aeruginosa. The sequence-based approach developed in this work can thus lead to several testable predictions for direct targets of CsrA homologs, thereby complementing and accelerating efforts to unravel global regulation by this important family of proteins.
TI  - The focal complex of epithelial cells provides a signalling platform for interleukin-8 induction in response to bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens can induce an inflammatory response from epithelial tissues due to secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Many bacterial pathogens manipulate components of the focal complex (FC) to induce signalling events in host cells. We examined the interaction of several bacterial pathogens with host cells, including Campylobacter jejuni, to determine if the FC is required for induction of chemokine signalling in response to bacterial pathogens. Our data indicate that secretion of IL-8 is triggered by C. jejuni, Helicobacter pylori and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in response to engagement of beta1 integrins. Additionally, we found that the secretion of IL-8 from C. jejuni infected epithelial cells requires FAK, Src and paxillin, which in turn are necessary for Erk 1/2 recruitment and activation. Targeting the FC component paxillin with siRNA prevented IL-8 secretion from cells infected with several bacterial pathogens, including C. jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Our findings indicate that maximal IL-8 secretion from epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection is dependent on the FC. Based on the commonality of the host response to bacterial pathogens, we propose that the FC is a signalling platform for an epithelial cell response to pathogenic organisms.
TI  - Phytochemistry and Preliminary Assessment of the Antibacterial Activity of Chloroform Extract of Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm. against Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Strains.
AB  - The chloroform extract of the stem bark of Amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.The extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). Preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which was purchased commercially.We have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced MICs ranging from215 to 431 mu g/mL against all bacterial species.New antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarMICresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of 431 mu g/mL.We conclude that A. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.
TI  - Microwave-assisted one-pot synthesis and anti-biofilm activity of 2-amino-1H-imidazole/triazole conjugates.
AB  - A microwave-assisted protocol was developed for the construction of 2-amino-1H-imidazole/triazole conjugates starting from the previously described 2-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ium salts. The process involves a one-pot hydrazinolysis/Dimroth-rearrangement of these salts followed by a ligand-free copper nanoparticle-catalyzed azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. The 2-amino-1H-imidazole/triazole conjugates showed moderate to high preventive activity against biofilms of S. Typhimurium, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The most active compounds had BIC50 values between 1.3 and 8 muM. A remarkable finding was that introduction of the triazole moiety into the side chain of 2-aminoimidazoles with a long (C8-C13) 2N-alkyl chain did drastically improve their activity. Conclusively, the 2-amino-1H-imidazole/triazole scaffold provides a lead structure for further design and development of novel biofilm inhibitors.
TI  - Murine solid tumours as a novel model to study bacterial biofilm formation in vivo.
AB  - Bacteria of many species are able to invade and colonize solid tumours in mice. We have focused on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Detailed analysis revealed that such tumour-invading Salmonella form biofilms, thus providing a versatile in vivo test system for studying bacterial phenotypes and host-pathogen interactions. It appears that biofilm formation by S. typhimurium is induced as a defence against the immune system of the host, and in particular against neutrophils. Further, we extended our work to the clinically more relevant biofilm infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The induction of P. aeruginosa biofilms in neoplastic tissue appears to be elicited as a reaction against the immune system. Reconstitution experiments reveal that T cells are responsible for biofilm induction. Isogenic mutants that are no longer able to form biofilms can be used for comparison studies to determine antimicrobial resistance, especially therapeutic efficacy against P. aeruginosa located in biofilms.
TI  - The natural antimicrobial carvacrol inhibits quorum sensing in Chromobacterium violaceum and reduces bacterial biofilm formation at sub-lethal concentrations.
AB  - The formation of biofilm by bacteria confers resistance to biocides and presents  problems in medical and veterinary clinical settings. Here we report the effect of carvacrol, one of the major antimicrobial components of oregano oil, on the formation of biofilms and its activity on existing biofilms. Assays were carried out in polystyrene microplates to observe (a) the effect of 0-0.8 mM carvacrol on the formation of biofilms by selected bacterial pathogens over 24 h and (b) the effect of 0-8 mM carvacrol on the stability of pre-formed biofilms. Carvacrol was able to inhibit the formation of biofilms of Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472, Salmonella enterica subsp. Typhimurium DT104, and Staphylococcus aureus 0074, while it showed no effect on formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (field isolate) biofilms. This inhibitory effect of carvacrol was observed at sub-lethal concentrations (<0.5 mM) where no effect was seen on total bacterial numbers, indicating that carvacrol's bactericidal effect was not causing the observed inhibition of biofilm formation. In contrast, carvacrol had (up to 8 mM) very little or no activity against existing biofilms of the bacteria described, showing that formation of the biofilm also confers protection against this compound. Since quorum sensing is an essential part of biofilm formation, the effect of carvacrol on quorum sensing of C. violaceum was also studied. Sub-MIC concentrations of carvacrol reduced expression of cviI (a gene coding for the N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone synthase), production of violacein (pigmentation) and chitinase activity (both regulated by quorum sensing) at concentrations coinciding with carvacrol's inhibiting effect on biofilm formation. These results indicate that carvacrol's activity in inhibition of biofilm formation may be related to the disruption of quorum sensing.
TI  - Mycosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles and their activity against some human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to biosynthesis silver nanoparticles from the fungus Nigrospora sphaerica isolated from soil samples and to examine their activity against five human pathogenic strains of bacteria viz. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus using disc diffusion method. The synergistic effect of silver nanoparticles in combination with commonly used antibiotic Gentamycin against the selected bacteria was also examined. The synthesized silver nanoparticles from free-cell filtrate were characterized by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis showed a peak at 420 nm indicating the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, FTIR analysis verified the detection of protein capping of silver nanoparticles while SEM micrographs revealed that the silver nanoparticles are dispersed and aggregated and mostly having spherical shape within the size range between 20 and 70 nm. The synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibited a varied growth inhibition activity (15-26 mm diam inhibition zones) against the tested pathogenic bacteria. A remarkable increase of bacterial growth inhibition (26-34 mm diam) was detected when a combination of silver nanoparticles and Gentamycin was used. A significant increase in fold area of antibacterial activity was observed when AgNPs in combination with Gentamycin was applied. The synthesized silver nanoparticles produced by the fungus N. sphaerica is a promising to be used as safe drug in medical therapy due to their broad spectrum against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Recombinant production of the antimicrobial peptide NZ17074 in Pichia pastoris using SUMO3 as a fusion partner.
AB  - The antimicrobial peptide NZ17074, which is derived from arenicin-3 isolated from Arenicola marina, displayed high activity against a broad range of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. However, NZ17074 has not been produced using fermentation technology. The aim of this work was to study the expression of difficult-to-express NZ17074 in Pichia pastoris by fusing with SUMO3. The DNA fragments of NZ17074 and SUMO3 were fused into SUMO3-NZ17074 using overlap PCR and cloned into the pPICZalphaA vector to construct the pPICZ-SUMO3-NZ17074 expression vector. The rSUMO3-NZ17074 fusion protein, purified by Ni(2) (+) -chelating affinity chromatography, was cleaved by 50% formic acid at 50 degrees C for 28 h to release recombinant NZ17074 (rNZ17074). After purification with second affinity column, 4.1 mg rNZ17074 peptide with the purity over 90% was obtained from per litre fermentation culture. The rNZ17074 peptide exhibited the significant inhibition activity against Gram-negative bacteria: its minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 2-4, 2 and 8-16 mug ml(-1) , respectively, which indicated that SUMO3 is a good fusion partner for the expression of the toxic peptide. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Recombinant active NZ17074 was produced with Pichia pastoris by using high-density fermentation technology for the first time. Our findings demonstrated the usefulness of SUMO-fusion technology as an effective expression strategy for synthesizing peptides in yeast. This SUMO3 expression system with a lower cost would likely be widely used for the production of other cytotoxic proteins including antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  - Binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. Hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. The present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. The results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. We hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. The alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. Bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. These findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.
TI  - Production of prodigiosin using tannery fleshing and evaluating its pharmacological effects.
AB  - AIM: The focal theme of present investigation includes isolation of prodigiosin producing fish gut bacteria, enhancing its production using tannery solid waste fleshing, and evaluation of its pharmacological effect. METHODS: Optimization of fermentation conditions to yield maximum prodigiosin, and instrumental analysis using FTIR, NMR, ESI-MS, TGA, and DSC. RESULTS: The optimum conditions required for the maximum prodigiosin concentration were achieved at time 30 h, temperature 30 degrees C, pH 8, and 3% substrate concentration. The secondary metabolite was analyzed using ESI-MS, FTIR, and NMR. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by in vitro anticancer studies. Among the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible at the lowest concentration followed by Salmonella typhi. IC(5)(0) concentration was cell line specific (HeLa cells: 4.3 microM, HEp2: 5.2 microM, and KB cells: 4.8 microM) and remains nontoxic up to the concentration of 25 microM on normal Vero cells suggesting that cancerous cells are more susceptible to the prodigiosin at lower concentration. CONCLUSION: Maximum prodigiosin production was obtained with tannery fleshing. The potency of the fish gut bacterial secondary metabolite prodigiosin as a therapeutic agent was confirmed through in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer studies.
TI  - Establishment of a bacterial infection model using the European honeybee, Apis mellifera L.
AB  - Injection of human pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes) into the hemocoel of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) workers kills the infected bees. The bee-killing effects of the pathogens were affected by temperature, and the LD(5)(0) values at 37 degrees C were more than 100-fold lower than those at 15 degrees C. Gene-disrupted S. aureus mutants of virulence genes such as agrA, saeS, arlR, srtA, hla, and hlb had attenuated bee-killing ability. Nurse bees were less susceptible than foragers and drones to S. aureus infection. Injection of antibiotics clinically used for humans had therapeutic effects against S. aureus infections of bees, and the ED(5)(0) values of these antibiotics were comparable with those determined in mammalian models. Moreover, the effectiveness of orally administered antibiotics was consistent between honeybees and mammals. These findings suggest that the honeybee could be a useful model for assessing the pathogenesis of human-infecting bacteria and the effectiveness of antibiotics.
TI  - A new ultrasonic high-throughput instrument for rapid DNA release from microorganisms.
AB  - Rapid detection methods for microbiological contamination are requested by many industries that respond to public health concerns. The control laboratories are replacing traditional culturing methods with faster assays based on nucleic acid amplification technologies, such as real-time PCR. However, an optimal nucleic acid sample preparation method is critical for the sensitivity and specificity of such tools. A high-throughput automated external ultrasonic device was developed for rapid lysing of microorganisms. Based on Ct values obtained from real-time PCR, there was efficient DNA release from the 16 microorganisms tested, including Gram positive and negative bacteria, bacterial spores, yeasts and spores of molds. Linearity of the lysis method was also demonstrated for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Candida albicans and the spores of Aspergillus brasiliensis, with correlation coefficients (r(2)) between 0.90 and 0.98. After sonication, PCR analysis of the lysates revealed earlier Ct values (0.83 to 7.49) for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and S. enterica compared to the bead-beating method of lysis. These results demonstrated more efficient DNA release from bacteria with the ultrasonication system. Nevertheless, for fungi, the Ct values were 0.94 to 1.61 later for sonication than for bead beating. This study demonstrates that 4min of sonication with this new automated high-throughput instrument allows for the efficient lysis of a large range of microorganisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial function of SHbetaAP, a novel hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide, isolated from the liver of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis.
AB  - A 2.3 kDa of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified liver extract of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and C18 reversed-phase HPLC. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with those of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the C-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain; thus, this peptide was designated as the Skipjack Hemoglobin beta chain-related Antimicrobial Peptide (SHbetaAP). SHbetaAP showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [MECs], 6.5-57.0 mug/mL), Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli D31, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, and two Vibrio parahaemolyticus species (MECs, 2.0-19.0 mug/mL), and against Candida albicans (MEC; 12.0 mug/mL) without significant hemolytic activity. Antimicrobial activity of this peptide was heatstable and pH resistant but is sensitive to proteases and salt. SHbetaAP did not show membrane permeabilization and killing ability. The secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling expected that this peptide formed an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. This is the first report the purification of a novel antimicrobial peptide related to the C-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain from marine fish.
TI  - Interaction of protamine with gram-negative bacteria membranes: possible alternative mechanisms of internalization in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - This study was concerned with the interaction between the cationic antimicrobial  peptide, protamine (Ptm) and the cytoplasmic membranes of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The objective of the study was to explain the observed paradox of internalization without permanent disruption of the cell envelope. We carried out Monte Carlo computer simulation of Ptm in an aqueous environment in the presence of ~100 mM NaCl and model membranes consisting of either (65:35) or (75:25) PE:PG molar ratios. The (75:25) model, representative of the gram-negative cytoplasmic membrane, showed that the Ptm center of mass remained at least 7 nm from the membrane surface leading to the prediction that Ptm would not internalize via disruption of the inner membrane. By using immunoelectron microscopy of Ptm-treated cells, we showed that Ptm internalization to the cytoplasm took place rapidly in the presence or absence of the outer envelope. Ultrastructural examination revealed no obvious morphological changes to cells that were treated with subinhibitory or bactericidal levels of Ptm. Reconstituted phospholipid bilayers were constructed and were unperturbed by Ptm treatment over a wide range of concentrations and applied transmembrane voltages. We conclude that in the cases of the cell envelopes of E. coli, S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa, Ptm internalized by means independent of the phospholipid bilayer, most likely mediated by one or more membrane proteins such as cation-selective barrel-like proteins. Work is currently underway to test this hypothesis.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Liquid based formulations of bacteriophages for the management of waterborne bacterial pathogens in water microcosms.
AB  - Water resources are contaminated by life-threatening multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria. Unfortunately, these pathogenic bacteria do not respond to the traditional water purification methods. Therefore, there is a need of environmentally friendly strategies to overcome the problems associated with the antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens. In the present study, highly potent lytic phages against multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from the Pavana river water. They belonged to the Podoviridae and Siphoviridae families. These phages were purified and enriched in the laboratory. Monovalent formulations of phiSPB, BVPaP-3 and KPP phages were prepared in three different liquids viz., phage broth, saline and distilled water. The phages were stable for almost 8-10 months in the phage broth at 4 degrees C. The stability of the phages in saline and distilled water was 5-6 months at 4 degrees C. All of the phages were stable only for 4-6 months in the phage broth at 30 degrees C. The monovalent phage formulation of psiSPB was applied at MOI < 1, as disinfectant against an exponential and stationary phase cells of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B in various water microcosms. The results indicated that there was almost 80 % reduction in the log phase cells of Salmonella serovar Paratyphi B in 24 h. In stationary phase cells, the reduction was comparatively less within same period. At the same time, there was concomitant increase in the phage population by 80% in all the microcosms indicating that psiSPB phage is highly potent in killing pathogen in water. Results strongly support that the formulation of psiSPB in the phage broth in monovalent form could be used as an effective biological disinfectant for preventing transmission of water-borne bacterial pathogens, including antimicrobial resistant ones.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antibacterial activity of Origanum vulgare subsp. glandulosum Desf. at different phenological stages.
AB  - Variation in the quantity and quality of the essential oil (EO) of wild population of Origanum vulgare at different phenological stages, including vegetative, late vegetative, and flowering set, is reported. The oils of air-dried samples were obtained by hydrodistillation. The yield of oils (w/w%) at different stages were in the order of late vegetative (2.0%), early vegetative (1.7%), and flowering (0.6%) set. The oils were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 36, 33, and 16 components were identified and quantified in vegetative, late vegetative, and flowering set, representing 94.47%, 95.91%, and 99.62% of the oil, respectively. Carvacrol was the major compound in all samples. The ranges of major constituents were as follows: carvacrol (61.08-83.37%), p-cymene (3.02-9.87%), and gamma-terpinene (4.13-6.34%). Antibacterial activity of the oils was tested against three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria by the disc diffusion method and determining their diameter of inhibition and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. The inhibition zones and MIC values for bacterial strains, which were sensitive to the EO of O. vulgare subsp. glandulosum, were in the range of 9-36 mm and 125-600 mug/mL, respectively. The oils of various phenological stages showed high activity against all tested bacteria, of which Bacillus subtilis was the most sensitive and resistant strain, respectively. Thus, they represent an inexpensive source of natural antibacterial substances that exhibited potential for use in pathogenic systems.
TI  - Prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-IIIa and aph(3')-IIa in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Austria.
AB  - The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-IIa primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-IIIa also inactivates amikacin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in Austria. In total, 10 541 Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. Isolates were analysed by aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII- and aph(3')-IIa/nptII-specific TaqMan real-time PCR. For positive strains, MICs using Etests were performed and resistance gene sequences were determined. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). In Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp., the aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %), 0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. Eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). Escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), Staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and P. aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-IIa. A single Salmonella isolate was positive, resulting in an aph(3')-IIa prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-IIIa. aph(3')-IIa/nptII genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene pool during the observation period.
TI  - Inhibition of multidrug efflux as a strategy to prevent biofilm formation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We have recently shown that inactivation of any of the multidrug efflux systems of Salmonella results in loss of the ability to form a competent biofilm. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism linking multidrug efflux and biofilm formation, and to determine whether inhibition of efflux is a viable antibiofilm strategy. METHODS: Mutants lacking components of the AcrAB-TolC system in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were investigated for their ability to aggregate, produce biofilm matrix components and form a biofilm. The potential for export of a biofilm-relevant substrate via efflux pumps was investigated and expression of genes that regulate multidrug efflux and production of biofilm matrix components was measured. The ability of efflux inhibitors carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, chlorpromazine and phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide to prevent biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus under static and flow conditions was assessed. RESULTS: Mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium that lack TolC or AcrB, but surprisingly not AcrA, were compromised in their ability to form biofilms. This defect was not related to changes in cellular hydrophobicity, aggregative ability or export of any biofilm-specific factor. The biofilm defect resulted from transcriptional repression of curli biosynthesis genes and consequent inhibition of production of curli. All three efflux inhibitors significantly reduced biofilm production in both static and flow biofilm assays, although different concentrations of each inhibitor were most active against each species. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that both genetic inactivation and chemical inhibition of efflux pumps results in transcriptional repression of biofilm matrix components and a lack of biofilm formation. Therefore, inhibition of efflux is a promising antibiofilm strategy.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Bioengineered 2'-fucosyllactose and 3-fucosyllactose inhibit the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteric pathogens to human intestinal and respiratory cell lines.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides help to prevent infectious diseases in breastfed infants. Larger scale testing, particularly in animal models and human clinical studies, is still limited due to shortened availability of more complex oligosaccharides. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL) synthesized by whole-cell biocatalysis for their biological activity in vitro. Therefore, we have tested these oligosaccharides for their inhibitory potential of pathogen adhesion in two different human epithelial cell lines. 2'-FL could inhibit adhesion of Campylobacter jejuni, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar fyris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the intestinal human cell line Caco-2 (reduction of 26%, 18%, 12%, and 17%, respectively), as could be shown for 3-FL (enteropathogenic E coli 29%, P aeruginosa 26%). Furthermore, adherence of P aeruginosa to the human respiratory epithelial cell line A549 was significantly inhibited by 2'-FL and 3-FL (reduction of 24% and 23%, respectively). These results confirm the biological and functional activity of biotechnologically synthesized human milk oligosaccharides. Mass-tailored human milk oligosaccharides could be used in the future to supplement infant formula ingredients or as preventatives to reduce the impact of infectious diseases.
TI  - Sustained broad-spectrum antibacterial effects of nanoliposomes loaded with silver nanoparticles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of microbial resistance to antibiotics warrants the search for effective broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been used as antimicrobial agents. AgNPs encapsulated in nanolipososmes have been developed as effective antimicrobial agents. MATERIALS & METHODS: Nanoliposomes (<50 nm) were prepared using a modified reverse-phase evaporation method, and spherical, dextrose-capped AgNPs were synthesized. The prepared liposome AgNPs (LAgNPs) were characterized, and tested for their antibacterial effects. RESULTS: The size of LAgNPs is 25-80 nm. The release of AgNPs from nanoliposomes was sustained over 10 h. Complete growth inhibition of Eschericia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was achieved using 180, 200, 160 and 120 microM, respectively, of LAgNPs. LAgNPs exhibited sustained broad-spectrum antibacterial effects compared with free AgNPs. CONCLUSION: Nanoliposomes loaded with AgNPs are potentially effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This new formula, which can be further fortified by encapsulation of additional established antibacterial agents, may be effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and also promote wound healing.
TI  - Comparison of 3M Petrifilm Aerobic Count Plates to standard plating methodology for use with AOAC antimicrobial efficacy methods 955.14, 955.15, 964.02, and 966.04 as an alternative enumeration procedure: collaborative study.
AB  - A multilaboratory study was conducted to determine the equivalence of the 3M Petrifilm Aerobic Count Plate and standard plating methodology for measuring viable bacteria and spores recovered from hard-surface carriers (stainless steel and porcelain), also known as "control carrier counts," used in AOAC antimicrobial efficacy test methods. Six laboratories participated in the study in which carriers inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and spores of Bacillus subtilis were evaluated using 3M Petrifilm Aerobic Count (AC) plates and standard plating side-by-side. The data were analyzed using a matched-pair t-test to determine the between-method effect with confidence intervals. For all test organisms pooled across all laboratories, the mean difference in log10 concentration between the standard plate count method and 3M Petrifilm AC Plates was -0.012, with a 95% confidence interval of (-0.090, +0.066), which was well within the -0.5, +0.5 interval established as the acceptance criterion. The between-carrier SD averaged 0.139; the between-replicate SD was 0.050. The carrier reproducibility, given that a single replicate per carrier is done, was estimated to be 0.148. Although differences were seen in the final concentrations of the test organisms among laboratories, there were no statistical differences between the enumeration methods. Based on the results from this study, 3M Petrifilm AC Plates are equivalent to standard plating methodology and can be used as an alternative procedure for the enumeration of test organisms used in AOAC Methods 955.14, 955.15, 964.02, and 966.04.
TI  - Cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by Lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
AB  - Cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by Lactobacillus plantarum CECT-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. The main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (PLA) and lactic acid (LA). The production of PLA by L. plantarum CECT-221 was evaluated in the Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or PPA. Using 30.5 mM PPA, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of PLA producing 16.4 mM PLA in 46 h. A concentration of 40 mM PPA was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. The biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of PPA; the average productivity of PLA increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mM after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mM mM(-1); meanwhile, LA reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g L(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). Cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with Carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), Listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and Salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). Additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that L. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. This is the first report of PLA production from cheese whey and PPA. The extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.
TI  - Synthesis and study of 1-ethyl-3-carbohydrazide and 3-[1-oxo-2-hydrazino-3-{p-toluenesulfon}]quinolone derivatives against bacterial infections.
AB  - We have synthesized newer series of quinolone derivatives substituted with hydrazine group (6a-e) and sulfonamide group (7a-e). These compounds were screened for antibacterial activity. All these compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic means and elemental analysis. From minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data, it has been observed that all the synthesized compounds exhibited good antibacterial activity in vitro.
TI  - The selectable antibiotic marker, tetA(C), increases Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to the herbicide/superoxide generator, paraquat.
AB  - The presence of the widely used selectable antibiotic marker, tetA(C), unexpectedly increased the sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to the superoxide-generating herbicide, paraquat. A DNA fragment spanning the first 99 amino acids of TetA(C) was sufficient to confer paraquat sensitivity. The TetA(C)-induced paraquat sensitive phenotype was observed in other Gram-negative bacteria such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium and Xanthomonas campestris suggesting that this is a general property of tetA(C). This finding serves as a cautionary note for those using tetA(C) as a selectable marker for genetic manipulations in studies using paraquat either as a superoxide stress generator or a redox cycling drug.
TI  - Pharmacological and toxicological evaluation of Sulcona((R)), a traditional Siddha medicine used in the treatment of burns.
AB  - Sulcona, a Siddha proprietary medicine used for the treatment of burns, has been  in practice for more than 50 years. This medicine has been successfully used on several burned patients with an excellent recovery and safety record. In this manuscript, we investigate some of its pharmacological and safety profiles. Treatment of cells with Sulcona induced a statistically significant increase in population doubling compared to concurrent controls in proliferating human lymphocytes as well as in Balb/c 3T3 cells, suggesting that it stimulates cell proliferation. Sulcona exhibited some antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus. Carrageenan-induced rat paw edema testing suggested that Sulcona has some anti-inflammatory properties. Patch testing showed that Sulcona has mild anesthetic effects. The above properties suggest Sulcona's pharmacological properties aidin treatment of burns. Sulcona did not show any skin irritation or sensitization or mutagenic potential suggesting that it is safe for use. Further work is necessary to elucidate its exact mechanisms of action.
TI  - Mechanistic antimicrobial approach of extracellularly synthesized silver nanoparticles against gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
AB  - The development of eco-friendly and reliable processes for the synthesis of nanoparticles has attracted considerable interest in nanotechnology. In this study, an extracellular enzyme system of a newly isolated microorganism, Exiguobacterium sp. KNU1, was used for the reduction of AgNO(3) solutions to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The extracellularly biosynthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The AgNPs were approximately 30 nm (range 5-50 nm) in size, well-dispersed and spherical. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial effects on different gram negative and gram positive bacteria using the minimum inhibitory concentration method. Reasonable antimicrobial activity against Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was observed. The morphological changes occurred in all the microorganisms tested. In particular, E. coli exhibited DNA fragmentation after being treated with the AgNPs. Finally, the mechanism for their bactericidal activity was proposed according to the results of scanning electron microscopy and single cell gel electrophoresis.
TI  - DNase I and Proteinase K eliminate DNA from injured or dead bacteria but not from living bacteria in microbial reference systems and natural drinking water biofilms for subsequent molecular biology analyses.
AB  - Molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR), are very sensitive, but may detect total DNA present in a sample, including extracellular DNA (eDNA) and DNA coming from live and dead cells. DNase I is an endonuclease that non-specifically cleaves single- and double-stranded DNA. This enzyme was tested in this study to analyze its capacity of digesting DNA coming from dead cells with damaged cell membranes, leaving DNA from living cells with intact cell membranes available for DNA-based methods. For this purpose, an optimized DNase I/Proteinase K (DNase/PK) protocol was developed. Intact Staphylococcus aureus cells, heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells, free genomic DNA of Salmonella enterica, and a mixture of these targets were treated according to the developed DNase/PK protocol. In parallel, these samples were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) as an already described assay for live-dead discrimination. Quantitative PCR and PCR-DGGE of the eubacterial 16S rDNA fragment were used to test the ability of the DNase/PK and PMA treatments to distinguish DNA coming from cells with intact cell membranes in the presence of DNA from dead cells and free genomic DNA. The methods were applied to three months old autochthonous drinking water biofilms from a pilot facility built at a German waterworks. Shifts in the DNA patterns observed after DGGE analysis demonstrated the applicability of DNase/PK as well as of the PMA treatment for natural biofilm investigation. However, the DNase/PK treatment demonstrated some practical advantages in comparison with the PMA treatment for live/dead discrimination of bacterial targets in drinking water systems.
TI  - Species-Dependent Blood-brain Barrier Disruption of Lipopolysaccharide: Amelioration by Colistin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The aim of this study was to use in vitro and in vivo models to assess the impact of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from two different bacterial species on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and brain uptake of colistin. Following repeated administration of LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the brain-to-plasma ratio of 14C-sucrose in Swiss Outbred mice was not significantly increased. Furthermore, while the brain uptake of colistin in mice increased 3-fold following administration of LPS from Salmonella enterica, LPS from P. aeruginosa had no significant effect on colistin brain uptake. This apparent species-dependent effect did not appear to correlate with differences in plasma cytokine levels as the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 following administration of each LPS was not different (p > 0.05). To clarify whether this species-specific effect of LPS was due to direct effects on the BBB, human brain capillary endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) were treated with LPS from P. aeruginosa or S. enterica and claudin-5 expression was measured by Western blotting. S. enterica LPS significantly (p < 0.05) reduced claudin-5 expression at a concentration of 7.5 mug/mL. In contrast, P. aeruginosa LPS only decreased (p < 0.05) claudin-5 expression at the highest concentration tested (i.e. 30 mug/mL). Co-administration of therapeutic concentrations of colistin ameliorated the S. enterica LPS-induced reduction in claudin-5 expression in hCMEC/D3 cells and the perturbation in BBB function in mice. This study demonstrates that BBB disruption induced by LPS is species-dependent, at least between P. aeruginosa and S. enterica, and can be ameliorated by colistin.
TI  - Extracellular DNA-induced antimicrobial peptide resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium PhoPQ two component system (TCS) is activated by low Mg2+ levels, low pH and by antimicrobial peptides (AP). Under Mg2+ limitation, the PhoPQ system induces pmrD expression, which post-translationally activates the PmrAB TCS. PhoPQ and PmrAB control many genes required for intracellular survival and pathogenesis. These include the polymyxin resistance (pmr) operon, which is required for aminoarabinose modification of LPS and protecting the outer membrane from antimicrobial peptide disruption and killing. Extracellular DNA is a ubiquitous polymer in the matrix of biofilms and accumulates in some infection sites. Extracellular DNA chelates cations and thus activates the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhoPQ/PmrAB systems, leading to expression of the orthologous arn (pmr) operon. RESULTS: Here we show that extracellular DNA induces expression of the S. Typhimurium pmr antimicrobial peptide resistance operon in a PhoPQ and PmrAB-dependent manner. Induction of the pmr genes by DNA was blocked when present with excess Mg2+. Exogenous DNA led to increased resistance of planktonic cultures to aminoglycosides, antimicrobial peptides (AP) and ciprofloxacin, but only AP resistance was PhoPQ/PmrAB-dependent. Extracellular DNA was shown to be a matrix component of S. Typhimurium biofilms cultivated in flow chambers and on glass surfaces. A pmrH-gfp fusion was highly expressed in flow chamber biofilms cultivated in medium with repressing levels of 10 mM Mg2+ and co-localized with eDNA. Expression of pmrH-lux was monitored in plastic peg biofilms and shown to require PhoPQ and PmrAB. Biofilms had higher levels of pmrH expression compared to planktonic cultures. We propose that DNA accumulation in biofilms contributes to the increased pmrH-lux expression in biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The Salmonella PhoPQ/PmrAB systems and antimicrobial peptide resistance are activated by the cation chelating properties of extracellular DNA. DNA-induced AP resistance may allow immune evasion and increased survival of S. Typhimurium biofilms formed during extracellular growth stages of an infection or outside the host.
TI  - Assessment of pathogenic bacteria in treated graywater and irrigated soils.
AB  - Reuse of graywater (GW) for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One major impediment for reuse of GW is the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. The presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicators were investigated in three GW recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland treatment systems and their respective irrigated yard soils. The treated GW and soils were monitored once every two months for six months using real-time quantitative PCR. As a control, samples from four soils irrigated with fresh water (FW) were similarly analyzed for pathogens and indicators. Comparable types of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Shigella spp., were found in the treated GW, their corresponding irrigated soils and the FW-irrigated soils. Moreover, the abundance of these bacteria in the GW- and FW-irrigated soils was of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the source of the pathogens cannot be established. Our results suggest that GW irrigation has no effect on the diversity and abundance of the tested pathogens and indicators in yard soils.
TI  - Formation of biofilms under phage predation: considerations concerning a biofilm  increase.
AB  - Bacteriophages are emerging as strong candidates for combating bacterial biofilms. However, reports indicating that host populations can, in some cases, respond to phage predation by an increase in biofilm formation are of concern. This study investigates whether phage predation can enhance the formation of biofilm and if so, if this phenomenon is governed by the emergence of phage-resistance or by non-evolutionary mechanisms (eg spatial refuge). Single-species biofilms of three bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) were pretreated and post-treated with species-specific phages. Some of the phage treatments resulted in an increase in the levels of biofilm of their host. It is proposed that the phenotypic change brought about by acquiring phage resistance is the main reason for the increase in the level of biofilm of P. aeruginosa. For biofilms of S. aureus and S. enterica Typhimurium, although resistance was detected, increased formation of biofilm appeared to be a result of non-evolutionary mechanisms.
TI  - CD137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. However, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, CD137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the Gram-positive (G(+)) intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. Herein, we report that CD137 deficiency or blocking of CD137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with G(+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CD137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against G(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against G(-) bacteria. Neutrophils were responsible for CD137-mediated opposite roles in control of G(+) and G(-) bacterial infections. Stimulation of CD137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against S. aureus but decreased these activities against E. coli, while CD137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of CD137 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that combined signaling of CD137 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of CD137 and TLR4 did not. Our data strongly suggest that CD137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with TLRs.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Identification of an essential active-site residue in the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase enzyme superfamily.
AB  - Enzymes in the alpha-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily catalyze the conversion of 1-phosphosugars to their 6-phospho counterparts. Their phosphoryl transfer reaction has long been proposed to require general acid-base catalysts, but candidate residues for these key roles have not been identified. In this study, we show through mutagenesis and kinetic studies that a histidine (His329) in the active site is critical for enzyme activity in a well-studied member of the superfamily, phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Crystallographic characterization of an H329A mutant protein showed no significant changes from the wild-type enzyme, excluding structural disruption as the source of its compromised activity. Mutation of the structurally analogous lysine residue in a related protein, phosphoglucomutase from Salmonella typhimurium, also results in significant catalytic impairment. Analyses of protein-ligand complexes of the P. aeruginosa enzyme show that His329 is appropriately positioned to abstract a proton from the O1/O6 hydroxyl of the phosphosugar substrates, and thus may serve as the general base in the reaction. Histidine is strongly conserved at this position in many proteins in the superfamily, and lysine is also often conserved at a structurally corresponding position, particularly in the phosphoglucomutase enzyme sub-group. These studies shed light on the mechanism of this important enzyme superfamily, and may facilitate the design of mechanism-based inhibitors. DATABASE: Structural data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 4IL8.
TI  - Elucidation of the 3-O-deacylase gene, pagL, required for the removal of primary  beta-hydroxy fatty acid from the lipid A in the nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont Rhizobium etli CE3.
AB  - Until now, the gene responsible for the 3-O-deacylation of lipid A among nitrogen-fixing endosymbionts has not been characterized. Several Gram-negative animal pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bordetella bronchiseptica contain an outer membrane 3-O-deacylase (PagL) that has been implicated in host immune evasion. The role of 3-O-deacylated lipid A among nitrogen-fixing endosymbionts, plant endophytes, and plant pathogens has not been studied. However, D'Haeze et al. (D'Haeze, W., Leoff, C., Freshour, G., Noel, K. D., and Carlson, R. W. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 17101-17113) reported that the lipopolysaccharide from Rhizobium etli CE3 bacteroids isolated from host bean root nodules contained exclusively tetraacylated lipid A that lacked a lipid A beta-hydroxymyristyl residue, an observation that is consistent with the possibility of PagL activity being important in symbiosis. A putative pagL gene was identified in the R. etli genome sequence. With this information, we created a pagL(-) mutant strain derived from R. etli CE3. Using mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that the mutant lacks 3-O-deacylated lipid A. The parent and mutant LPS were very similar as determined by gel electrophoresis and glycosyl composition analysis using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. However, fatty acid analysis showed that the mutant lipid A contained larger amounts of beta-hydroxypentadecanoic acid than that of the parent. Furthermore, the mutant was adversely affected in establishing symbiosis with its host, Phaseolus vulgaris.
TI  - Recombinant heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60/GroEL) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi elicits cross-protection against multiple bacterial pathogens in mice.
AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) or stress proteins are recognized as protective antigens against a wide range of bacterial diseases. Conservation of HSPs across different life forms also appears to contribute to the antigenicity of these proteins. Due to their high sequence homology, there exists an immunological cross-recognition between different bacterial species. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of recombinant GroEL of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi as a vaccine candidate against various bacterial pathogens viz.; Shigella dysenteriae type I, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro serum bactericidal assay (SBA) with GroEL antisera showed 50-55% inhibition of cells of Shigella Spp., 65-75% of E. coli, 60-65% of K. pneumoniae, 45-50% of P. aeruginosa. In in vivo experiments, mice immunized with GroEL protein of S. Typhi showed 60-65% protection against S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae type I, S. boydii. Similarly 75-80% protection was observed against enteropathogenic E. coli, 70-80% against K. pneumoniae. 50% of mice survived the lethal infection against P. aeruginosa. Organ burden and histopathological studies also revealed significant reduction of bacterial infection. This study shows the cross-protective efficacy of recombinant GroEL of S. Typhi which could lead to the development of a single vaccine candidate protective against multiple bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Bovine whole-blood culture as a tool for the measurement of endotoxin activities  in Gram-negative bacterial vaccines.
AB  - In order to analyze bovine immune reactions against the Gram-negative bacterial vaccine, bovine whole-blood culture was used to investigate the pro-inflammatory cytokine responses stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We also examined the interaction between LPS and aluminum hydroxide gel for endotoxin activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses of whole bovine blood. Alteration in the mRNA concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-10 in whole-blood culture at 4h after stimulation with different doses of LPS was observed and determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The mRNA concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta changed in a dose-dependent manner and differed depending on the type of LPS. Limulus test revealed that endotoxin activity was remarkably reduced when aluminum hydroxide gel was added to LPS. In contrast, the mRNA concentration of TNF-alpha in whole bovine blood was enhanced by LPS mixed with aluminum hydroxide gel. These results suggest that bovine whole-blood culture can be utilized to detect endotoxin activity of Gram-negative bacterial vaccines. In addition, whole-blood culture offers several advantages, such as ease of performance, few preparation artifacts, and a physiological cell environment, for investigating bovine immune response compared with the Limulus test.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - A human IgG anti-Vi reference for Salmonella typhi with weight-based antibody units assigned.
AB  - Recent data showing the high incidence of typhoid fever in young children, the demonstration of safety and efficacy of a Vi conjugate for this age group, the safety and similar immunogenicity in infants when administrated concurrently with EPI vaccines, together with the interests of manufacturers and investigators in studying such conjugate vaccines prompted us to prepare a human IgG anti-Vi standard to facilitate this work. Volunteers were injected with an investigational Vi-recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein A (Vi-rEPA) conjugate vaccine. Plasmas with the highest levels of IgG anti-Vi were pooled. The IgG anti-Vi content of this preparation, assayed by precipitin analysis with purified Vi, was 33 mug/ml. Accordingly, the estimated IgG anti-Vi protective level of 3.5 ELISA unit/ml, derived from our efficacy trial of Vi-rEPA in 2-5 years old children, is equivalent to 4.3 mug/ml. This reagent is suitable for comparison of immune response of Vi conjugate vaccines or for other purposes requiring anti-Vi measurement.
TI  - Ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether two antibacterial biflavonoids from Ochna pretoriensis (Ochnaceae).
AB  - The acetone extract of Ochna pretoriensis was evaluated for antibacterial activity using bioautography and serial microplate dilution methods against four nosocomial bacterial pathogens namely: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of two antibacterial biflavonoids, ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to the isolated compounds than the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC values: 31.3 microg/mL for P. aeruginosa and 62.5 microg/mL for S. aureus). In addition, the isolated compounds were assessed for their potential toxic effects in the MTT toxicity assay using monkey kidney vero cells and Ames genotoxicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. LC50 values were 125.9 microg/mL for ochnaflavone and 162.0/microg/mL for ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. The isolated compounds have selectivity index values ranging from 1.29 to 4.03. Selectivity index values higher than one indicate that test samples are less toxic to the host cells than to the pathogens. The biflavonoids did not have any mutagenic effects in the Salmonella/microsome assay without metabolic activation.
TI  - Salmonella Promotes ASC Oligomerization-dependent Caspase-1 Activation.
AB  - Innate immune cells sense and respond to the cytoplasmic infection of bacterial pathogens through NLRP3, NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasome depending on the unique molecular pattern of invading pathogens. The infection of flagellin- or type III secretion system (T3SS)-containing Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) triggers NLRC4-dependent caspase-1 activation leading to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1-beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18. Previous studies have shown that apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) is also required for Salmonella-induced caspase-1 activation, but it is still unclear how ASC contributes to the activation of NLRC4 inflammasome in response to S. typhimurium infection. In this study, we demonstrate that S. typhimurium triggers the formation of ASC oligomer in a potassium depletion-independent manner as determined by in vitro crosslinking and in situ fluorescence imaging. Remarkably, inhibition of potassium efflux failed to block Salmonella-promoted caspase-1 activation and macrophage cell death. These results collectively suggest that ASC is substantially oligomerized to facilitate the activation of caspase-1 in response to S. typhimurium infection. Contrary to NLRP3 inflammasome, intracellular potassium depletion is not critical for NLRC4 inflammasome signaling by S. typhimurium.
TI  - Monitoring of growth and physiological activities of biofilm during succession on polystyrene from activated sludge under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  - The present research work monitored the successive biofilm development and its catabolic role in the degradation of polystyrene (PS). PS material was artificially colonized with biofilm by incubating it with activated sludge under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Biofilm formation was monitored by gravimetric weight analysis, spectrophotometric absorbance technique, heterotrophic plate count, and scanning electron microscopy under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The wet weight (1.59 and 1.17 g) and dry weight (0.41 and 0.08 g) of a biofilm showed a significant constant increase under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, from first till 9 weeks of incubation. Plate count of the selected bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) considerably declined (90-99 %) in the biofilm after seventh and fifth weeks of incubation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, indicating a positive shift from pathogenic to beneficial microbial community. While most probable number index of fecal coliforms and E. coli in the sludge showed more reduction (98 and 99 %) under aerobic as compare to anaerobic conditions (86 and 91 %) after 9 weeks of biofilm formation on PS cubes. Correspondingly, the decreasing levels of chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand (up to 73 %) showed signs of sludge digestion. Scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope revealed nature of PS media containing high carbon content. However, biofilm development proved to be involved in the biochemical transformation of the PS medium as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
TI  - FlgM proteins from different bacteria exhibit different structural characteristics.
AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a unique class of proteins that do not require a stable structure for function. The importance of IDPs in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. Our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous FlgM proteins, a model class of IDPs. We have previously shown that the FlgM protein from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus has more structure at A. aeolicus' physiological temperature (85 degrees C) than is observed for the Salmonella typhimurium FlgM, suggesting that the disordered nature of FlgM varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. In this work, we extend these studies to the FlgM proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that the B. subtilis, E. coli, and S. typhimurium FlgMs exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the B. subtilis FlgM is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. The P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis FlgM proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. The P. aeruginosa FlgM appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the P. mirabilis FlgM. These results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of monofloral bee pollen.
AB  - The main aim of this study was to determine antioxidant properties and antibacterial activity of monofloral bee pollen samples to pathogenic bacteria. These samples were collected in different localities in Slovakia. The antioxidant properties of examined plant species were different and decreasing in the following order: Brassica napus subsp. napus L > Papaver somniferum L. > Helianthus annuus L. The antimicrobial effect of the bee product samples were tested by using the agar well diffusion method. The methanol (99.9% and 70%) and the ethanol (96% and 70%) were used for extraction. In this study, five different strains of bacteria were tested: Listeria monocytogenes CCM 4699; Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCM 1960; Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953; Salmonella enterica CCM 4420; and Escherichia coli CCM 3988. The most sensitive bacteria of the poppy pollen ethanolic extract was Staphylococcus aureus was (70%) The most sensitive bacteria of rape bee pollen methanolic extract (70%) and sunflower ethanolic extract (70%) was Salmonella enterica.
TI  - Purification and biochemical characterization of a highly thermostable bacteriocin isolated from Brevibacillus brevis strain GM100.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing (11,000 AU mL(-1)) strain was isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy Algerian plants Ononis angustissima Lam., and identified as Brevibacillus brevis strain GM100. The bacteriocin, called Bac-GM100, was purified to homogeneity from the culture supernatant, and, based on MALDI-TOF/MS analysis, was a monomer protein with a molecular mass of 4375.66 Da. The 21 N-terminal residues of Bac-GM100 displayed 65% homology with thurincin H from Bacillus thuringiensis. Bac-GM100 was extremely heat-stable (20 min at 120 degrees C), and was stable within a pH range of 3-10. It proved sensitive to various proteases, which demonstrated its protein nature. It was also found to display a bactericidal mode of action against gram-negative (Salmonella enteric ATCC 43972, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58) and gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis ENSAIA 631 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538) bacteria, and a fungistatic mode of action against the pathogenic fungus Candida tropicalis R2 CIP 203.
TI  - Furanone-containing poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers for cell-adhesion inhibition.
AB  - The 3(2H) furanone derivative 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMHF) was investigated for its antimicrobial and cell-adhesion inhibition properties against Klebsiella pneumoniae Xen 39, Staphylococcus aureus Xen 36, Escherichia coli Xen 14, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Xen 5 and Salmonella typhimurium Xen 26. Nanofibers electrospun from solution blends of DMHF and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were tested for their ability to inhibit surface-attachment of bacteria. Antimicrobial and adhesion inhibition activity was determined via the plate counting technique. To quantify viable but non-culturable cells and to validate the plate counting results, bioluminescence and fluorescence studies were carried out. Nanofiber production was upscaled using the bubble electrospinning technique. To ascertain that no DMHF leached into filtered water, samples of water filtered through the nanofibrous mats were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to characterize the electrospun nanofibers.
TI  - [Real-time PCR detection and quantification of emerging waterborne pathogens (EWPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the downstream area of Jiulong River].
AB  - The emerging waterborne pathogens (EWPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are important for drinking water safety. The detection and quantification of 7 EWPs and 4 ARGs were carried out in Jiulong River, which is the main water source of southwestern Fujian Province. The water samples were collected from four sites of the Jiulong River downstream area and a drinking water treatment plant nearby. DNA was extracted and quantified by real-time (SYBR Green) PCR methods after the samples were filtered through 0.22 pim membranes. The results showed that the amount of Salmonella enterica (Salmonella spp.), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) could reach up to 10(3), 10(4) and 10(5) copies x mL(-1), respectively. The concentration of organic matter in water may affect the copy numbers significantly. The water plant could effectively remove most EWPs and ARGs except Salmonella spp.. Therefore, more efforts should be made on water pollution source control, water treatment technology and point-of-use system to make sure the safety of drinking water.
TI  - Ramariolides A-D, antimycobacterial butenolides isolated from the mushroom Ramaria cystidiophora.
AB  - Four butenolides, ramariolides A-D (1-4), have been isolated from the fruiting bodies of the coral mushroom Ramaria cystidiophora. Their structures were elucidated by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR data and a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 1, and their absolute configurations were established using Mosher's method. The major metabolite, ramariolide A (1), which contains an unusual spiro oxiranebutenolide moiety, showed in vitro antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
TI  - The response threshold of Salmonella PilZ domain proteins is determined by their  binding affinities for c-di-GMP.
AB  - c-di-GMP is a bacterial second messenger that is enzymatically synthesized and degraded in response to environmental signals. Cellular processes are affected when c-di-GMP binds to receptors which include proteins that contain the PilZ domain. Although each c-di-GMP synthesis or degradation enzyme metabolizes the same molecule, many of these enzymes can be linked to specific downstream processes. Here we present evidence that c-di-GMP signalling specificity is achieved through differences in affinities of receptor macromolecules. We show that the PilZ domain proteins of Salmonella Typhimurium, YcgR and BcsA, demonstrate a 43-fold difference in their affinity for c-di-GMP. Modulation of the affinities of these proteins altered their activities in a predictable manner in vivo. Inactivation of yhjH, which encodes a predicted c-di-GMP degrading enzyme, increased the fraction of the cellular population that demonstrated c-di-GMP levels high enough to bind to the higher-affinity YcgR protein and inhibit motility, but not high enough to bind to the lower-affinity BcsA protein and stimulate cellulose production. Finally, PilZ domain proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a 145-fold difference in binding affinities, suggesting that regulation by binding affinity may be a conserved mechanism that allows organisms with many c-di-GMP binding macromolecules to rapidly integrate multiple environmental signals into one output.
TI  - Facile water promoted synthesis of 1,2,3-triazolyl dihydropyrimidine-2-thione hybrids - highly potent antibacterial agents.
AB  - An elegant and efficient synthesis of hitherto novel 1,2,3-triazolyl dihydropyrimidine-2-thione hybrids has been accomplished for the first time in a green solvent viz. water. The hybrid molecules exhibit significant antibacterial activity when screened against four human pathogens viz. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi. In comparison to the commercially marketed tetracycline, some of them were equally potent and a few more potent.
TI  - The target of daptomycin is absent from Escherichia coli and other gram-negative  pathogens.
AB  - Antistaphylococcal agents commonly lack activity against Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli owing to the permeability barrier presented by the outer membrane and/or the action of efflux transporters. When these intrinsic resistance mechanisms are artificially compromised, such agents almost invariably demonstrate antibacterial activity against Gram negatives. Here we show that this is not the case for the antibiotic daptomycin, whose target appears to be absent from E. coli and other Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Exchangeability of the flagellin (FliC) and the cap protein (FliD) among different species in flagellar assembly.
AB  - Flagellar filament self-assembles from the component protein, flagellin or FliC,  with the aid of the capping protein, HAP2 or FliD. Depending on the helical parameters of filaments, flagella from various species are divided into three groups, family I, II, and III. Each family coincides with the traditional classification of flagella, peritrichous flagella, polar flagella, and lateral flagella, respectively. To elucidate the physico-chemical properties of flagellin to separate families, we chose family I flagella and family II flagella and examined how well the exchangeability of a combination of FliC and/or FliD from different families is kept in filament formation. FliC or FliD of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salty; family I) were exchanged with those of Escherichia coli (Escco; family I) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseae; family II). In a Salty fliC deletion mutant, Escco FliC formed short filaments, but Pseae FliC did not form filaments. In a Salty fliD deletion mutant, both Escco FliD and Pseae FliD allowed Salty FliC to polymerize into short filaments. In conclusion, FliC can be exchanged among the same family but not between different families, while FliD serves as the cap protein even in different families, confirming that FliC is essential for determining families, but FliD plays a subsidiary role in filament formation.

TI  - Effects of parabens and isothiazolinone on the microbiological quality of baby shampoo: the challenge test.
AB  - An in vitro microbial challenge test has been developed to predict the likelihood of consumer contamination of baby shampoo. Four preservatives were tested in our study: the parbens Medcide D, Medcide PB, Sepicide HB. and isothiazolinone Methylisothiazolinone/Chloromethylisothiazolinone [MI/MCI]. These preservatives were tested separately and in combination. The challenge test involved inoculating the product with Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus brasiliensis and Candida albicans. Inhibition growth of these microorganisms at each preservative concentration was followed over a 28 d period. The test was used to classify products as poorly preserved, marginally preserved, or well-preserved. Interestingly, it was the combination (0.1% Isothiazolinone [MI/MCI] and 0.1% Sepicide HB) which inhibited most the microbial growth of microorganims while preserving the physicochemical properties of the product. As a result, the challenge test described can be accurately used to predict the risk of consumer contamination of cosmetic products.
TI  - YgiW homologous gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25W is responsible for tributyltin resistance.
AB  - A tributyltin (TBT) resistance gene was isolated from the TBT-resistant marine origin bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25W. This gene was identical to PA0320 deposited in the P. aeruginosa PAO1 database (http://www.pseudomonas.com). The deduced amino acid sequence of PA0320 appears to be homologous to the YgiW proteins of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. The deletion mutant of PA0320 showed a reduction of growth rate in the presence of TBT. A susceptibility test to cadmium, mercury, hydrogen peroxide and acidic pH in the deletion mutant showed an increasing susceptibility to them. PA0320 plays a certain role in stress tolerance against TBT as well as in stressors producing reactive oxygen species.
TI  - Discovery and biological characterization of geranylated RNA in bacteria.
AB  - A general MS-based screen for unusually hydrophobic cellular small molecule-RNA conjugates revealed geranylated RNA in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica var. Typhimurium. The geranyl group is conjugated to the sulfur atom in two 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine nucleotides. These geranylated nucleotides occur in the first anticodon position of tRNA(Glu)(UUC), tRNA(Lys)(UUU) and tRNA(Gln)(UUG) at a frequency of up to 6.7% (~400 geranylated nucleotides per cell). RNA geranylation can be increased or abolished by mutation or deletion of the selU (ybbB) gene in E. coli, and purified SelU protein in the presence of geranyl pyrophosphate and tRNA can produce geranylated tRNA. The presence or absence of the geranyl group in tRNA(Glu)(UUC), tRNA(Lys)(UUU) and tRNA(Gln)(UUG) affects codon bias and frameshifting during translation. These RNAs represent the first reported examples of oligoisoprenylated cellular nucleic acids.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Escherichia coli strongly supports the growth of Histomonas meleagridis, in a monoxenic culture, without influence on its pathogenicity.
AB  - Based on clonal cultures of Histomonas meleagridis, monoxenic cultures have, to our knowledge for the first time, been established in a liquid medium. The faecal flora was exchanged for defined bacterial strains by selective destruction of the initial bacteria with a variety of antibiotics, keeping the flagellate alive. The growth of the protozoan parasite was found to depend on the bacteria, especially on their energy metabolism. Escherichia coli was found to strongly support the growth of the parasite, whereas Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less efficient. Confocal laser microscopy showed that H. meleagridis could take up green fluorescent protein-tagged E. coli DH5alpha, suggesting that bacteria serve as a food supply for the protozoa. By exchanging the bacterial flora for E. coli strain DH5alpha in H. meleagridis cultures that underwent continuous in vitro passages, it was possible to show that the in vivo attenuation process was independent of the bacteria. Furthermore, the gut flora in infected turkeys had no negative effect on the protozoan's virulence. Consequently, attenuation depends not on the bacteria in the culture but on the in vitro passages. Finally, the experiments provided evidence that the infection of turkeys with H. meleagridis enabled infection of the liver with E. coli.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens commandeer Rab GTPases to establish intracellular niches.
AB  - Intracellular bacterial pathogens deploy virulence factors termed effectors to inhibit degradation by host cells and to establish intracellular niches where growth and differentiation take place. Here, we describe mechanisms by which human bacterial pathogens (including Chlamydiae; Coxiella burnetii; Helicobacter pylori; Legionella pneumophila; Listeria monocytogenes; Mycobacteria; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica) modulate endocytic and exocytic Rab GTPases in order to thrive in host cells. Host cell Rab GTPases are critical for intracellular transport following pathogen phagocytosis or endocytosis. At the molecular level bacterial effectors hijack Rab protein function to: evade degradation, direct transport to particular intracellular locations and monopolize host vesicles carrying molecules that are needed for a stable niche and/or bacterial growth and differentiation. Bacterial effectors may serve as specific receptors for Rab GTPases or as enzymes that post-translationally modify Rab proteins or endosomal membrane lipids required for Rab function. Emerging data indicate that bacterial effector expression is temporally and spatially regulated and multiple virulence factors may act concertedly to usurp Rab GTPase function, alter signaling and ensure niche establishment and intracellular bacterial growth, making this field an exciting area for further study.
TI  - An expeditious regioselective synthesis of novel bioactive indole-substituted chromene derivatives via one-pot three-component reaction.
AB  - Novel fused 1H-benzo[f]chromen-indole derivatives were synthesized regioselectivly in good to high yields by triethyl amine catalyzed condensation of 3-cyanoacetylindoles, beta-naphthol and aryl aldehydes in methanol under ultrasounic irradiations and conventional conditions. The easy work-up of the products, rapidity, and mild reaction conditions are notable features of this protocol. The antibacterial activity of the selected products was examined. Some products showed promising activities.
TI  - Mining the antibiogram: what more can it tell us?
AB  
TI  - The influences of natural zeolite (cliptinolite) on ammonia and biogenic amine formation by foodborne pathogen.
AB  - The influence of natural zeolite on biogenic amines (BAs) and ammonia (AMN) production by eight common gram negative and positive foodborne pathogens (FBP) were investigated in histidine decarboxylase broth (HDB). Presence of 1% zeolite in the HDB resulted in significantly higher AMN production. Histamine (HIS) production by gram positive bacteria was as low as 0.5 mg/L, whereas Escherichia coli produced 18.96 mg/L of HIS. The use of zeolite also significantly suppressed HIS accumulation by E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. paratyphi A (P < 0.05), although zeolite addition stimulated HIS production by K. pneumonia and Aeromonas hydrophila. The range of tyramine (TYR) production by gram positive bacteria was 1.19 and 4.06 mg/L for Enteroccus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes respectively. The results of study showed that the effect of zeolite on BAs and AMN production was dependent on bacterial strains, as well as zeolite concentrations used. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Natural zeolites are the main absorptive, low-cost material used in agriculture and industry. Although the effect of zeolite on ammonia formation in some industrial systems is well known, there is limited information regarding the impact of zeolite on biogenic amine (BA) production by foodborne pathogens. The data presented in this article will help us to understand the impact of natural zeolite on BA and ammonia production by eight common foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment of bacteria to abiotic surfaces and shrimp by Malaysian herb extracts.
AB  - The use of simple crude water extracts of common herbs to reduce bacterial attachment may be a cost-effective way to control bacterial foodborne pathogens, particularly in developing countries. The ability of water extracts of three common Malaysian herbs (Andrographis paniculata, Eurycoma longifolia, and Garcinia atroviridis) to modulate hydrophobicity and attachment to surfaces of five food-related bacterial strains (Bacillus cereus ATCC 14576, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) were determined. The bacterial attachment to hydrocarbon assay was used to determine bacterial hydrophobicity. Staining and direct microscopic counts were used to determine attachment of bacteria to glass and stainless steel. Plating on selective media was used to determine attachment of bacteria to shrimp. All extracts were capable of either significantly ( P < 0.05) increasing or decreasing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Bacterial attachment to all surfaces was either significantly (P < 0.05) increased or decreased, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Overall, hydrophobicity did not show a significant correlation (P > 0.05) to bacterial attachment. For specific combinations of bacteria, surface material, and plant extract, significant correlations (R > 0.80) between hydrophobicity and attachment were observed. The highest of these was observed for S. aureus attachment to stainless steel and glass after treatment with the E. longifolia extract (R = 0.99, P < 0.01). The crude water herb extracts in this study were shown to have the potential to modulate specific bacterial and surface interactions and may, with further work, be useful for the simple and practical control of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and increased freeze-drying stability of sialyllactose-reduced silver nanoparticles using sucrose and trehalose.
AB  - The resistance to current antibiotics results in the emergence of health-threatening bacteria. Silver nanoparticles are known to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activities without the development of resistance. Herein, we developed a green synthetic method for the preparation of silver nanoparticles with sialyllactose instead of toxic chemicals as a reducing agent, which would improve its therapeutic applicability and increase its biocompatibility. Oven incubation, autoclaving and microwave irradiation methods were applied to prepare the silver nanoparticles. High resolution-transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images revealed mostly spherical and amorphous silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 23.64 nm. Fourier Transform-infrared spectra suggest that the N-H amide of sialyllactose might be involved in the binding of silver nanoparticles. Based on thermogravimetric analyses, 2,3-sialyllactose-reduced silver nanoparticles are composed of 54.3 wt% organic components and 45.7 wt% metallic silver. Enhanced antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles (approximately 8-fold) were observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (minimum inhibitory concentration 16 microg/mL). Next, we employed the use of carbohydrate stabilizers to increase the stability of silver nanoparticles during a freeze-drying process. It was found that sucrose and trehalose were the most effective stabilizers. In addition, silver nanoparticles possessed excellent salt stability as well as on-the-shelf stability in the presence of these stabilizers. Derivatives of sialic acid are known to be anti-influenza agents; therefore, the newly prepared silver nanoparticles may serve as useful antibacterial and antiviral agents to cope with both pathogenic bacteria and viruses in the near future.
TI  - Effect of systemic infection induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the brain uptake of colistin in mice.
AB  - In view of reports of colistin-induced neurotoxicity in infected patients, the aim of this study was to assess whether the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the brain uptake of colistin are altered in the presence of systemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Bacteremia was confirmed 8 h after intramuscular administration of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 to Swiss Outbred mice, at which time a single subcutaneous dose of colistin sulfate (40 mg/kg of body weight) or an intravenous dose of [(14)C]sucrose (2 muCi) was administered. Despite a substantial elevation in plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 during bacterial infection, the brain uptake of colistin was similar between infected and noninfected mice with AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma) (where AUC(brain) is the area under the brain concentration-time curve and AUC(plasma) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve) ratios of 0.023 and 0.024, respectively. Similarly, the brain-to-plasma ratios of [(14)C]sucrose were no different between infected and noninfected mice, consistent with a lack of effect of bacteremia on BBB integrity. To further correlate any relationship between BBB disruption and plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, BBB integrity, colistin brain uptake, and plasma proinflammatory cytokines were measured following the administration of Salmonella enterica lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agent known to induce BBB disruption. Despite LPS inducing a 4-fold increase in colistin brain uptake and a significant (P < 0.05) 1.2-fold increase in [(14)C]sucrose BBB penetration, plasma cytokine levels were lower with LPS treatment relative to those obtained with bacterial infection with P. aeruginosa. This study demonstrates that the brain uptake of colistin is not increased in mice during P. aeruginosa-induced systemic bacteremia despite a significant increase in plasma levels of three proinflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Whole blood-derived microRNA signatures in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is recognized as the most potent microbial mediator presaging the threat of invasion of Gram-negative bacteria that implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock. This study was designed to examine the microRNA (miRNA) expression in whole blood from mice injected with intraperitoneal LPS. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of varying concentrations (range, 10-1000 mug) of LPS from different bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Serratia marcescens and were killed 2, 6, 24, and 72 h after LPS injection. Whole blood samples were obtained and tissues, including lung, brain, liver, and spleen, were harvested for miRNA expression analysis using an miRNA array (Phalanx miRNA OneArray(R) 1.0). Upregulated expression of miRNA targets in the whole blood of C57BL/6 and Tlr4(-/-) mice injected with LPS was quantified using real-time RT-PCR and compared with that in the whole blood of C57BL/6 mice injected with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Following LPS injection, a significant increase of 15 miRNAs was observed in the whole blood. Among them, only 3 miRNAs showed up-regulated expression in the lung, but no miRNAs showed a high expression level in the other examined tissues. Upregulated expression of the miRNA targets (let-7d, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-25, miR-92a, miR-103, miR-107 and miR-451) following LPS injection on real-time RT-PCR was dose- and time-dependent. miRNA induction occurred after 2 h and persisted for at least 6 h. Exposure to LPS from different bacteria did not induce significantly different expression of these miRNA targets. Additionally, significantly lower expression levels of let-7d, miR-25, miR-92a, miR-103, and miR-107 were observed in whole blood of Tlr4(-/-) mice. In contrast, LTA exposure induced moderate expression of miR-451 but not of the other 7 miRNA targets. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a specific whole blood-derived miRNA signature in mice exposed to LPS, but not to LTA, from different gram-negative bacteria. These whole blood-derived miRNAs are promising as biomarkers for LPS exposure.
TI  - Characterization of five novel endolysins from Gram-negative infecting bacteriophages.
AB  - We here characterize five globular endolysins, encoded by a set of Gram-negative  infecting bacteriophages: BcepC6gp22 (Burkholderia cepacia phage BcepC6B), P2gp09 (Escherichia coli phage P2), PsP3gp10 (Salmonella enterica phage PsP3), K11gp3.5 and KP32gp15 (Klebsiella pneumoniae phages K11 and KP32, respectively). In silico, BcepC6gp22, P2gp10 and PsP3gp10 are predicted to possess lytic transglycosylase activity, whereas K11gp3.5 and KP32gp15 have putative amidase activity. All five endolysins show muralytic activity on the peptidoglycan of several Gram-negative bacterial species. In vitro, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is clearly sensitive for the antibacterial action of the five endolysins in the presence of the outer membrane permeabilizer EDTA: reductions are ranging from 1.89 to 3.08 log units dependent on the endolysin. The predicted transglycosylases BcepC6gp22, P2gp10 and PsP3gp10 have a substantially higher muralytic and in vitro antibacterial activity compared to the predicted amidases K11gp3.5 and KP32gp15, highlighting the impact of the catalytic specificity on endolysin activity. Furthermore, initial data exclude the synergistic lethal effect of a combination of the predicted transglycosylase PsP3gp10 and the predicted amidase K11gp3.5 on PAO1. As these globular endolysins show a lower enzymatic and antibacterial activity, in comparison to modular endolysins, we suggest that the latter should be favored for antibacterial applications.
TI  - The antimicrobial profile of extracts of a Phormidium-like cyanobacterium changes with phosphate levels.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of lipophilic extracts of mat-forming Phormidium-like  cyanobacterium isolated from Egypt was investigated under different phosphate concentrations. The antimicrobial profile changed with different phosphate levels indicating metabolic changes under stressful conditions. The fractions that resulted in highest antimicrobial activity from the three different phosphate concentrations were chosen for further analyses. The bioactive compounds were identified using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques including UV, FTIR, GC-MS and proton-NMR. The chemical analyses indicated that the compound at standard phosphate concentration was eugenol whereas the bioactive compound at half phosphate concentration was 4-tert-butylcyclohexanol. The third bioactive compound at quarter phosphate concentration was octadecanoic acid. The eugenol is known for its antimicrobial as well as pain relief properties and can be used in many pharmaceutical preparations whereas the octadecanoic acid and cyclohexanol derivative are used in some antimicrobial pharmaceuticals. The study highlights the change in antimicrobial profile of bioactive compounds derived from cyanobacteria through manipulating the concentration of a key nutrient in growth medium. This strategy can be employed for mass production of these compounds and others for future biotechnological applications.
TI  - Parenteral nutrition suppresses the bactericidal response of the small intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parenteral nutrition (PN) increases infectious risk in critically ill patients compared with enteral feeding. Previously, we demonstrated that PN feeding suppresses the concentration of the Paneth cell antimicrobial protein secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) in the gut lumen. sPLA2 and other Paneth cell proteins are released in response to bacterial components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and they modulate the intestinal microbiome. Because the Paneth cell protein sPLA2 was suppressed with PN feeding, we hypothesized PN would diminish the responsiveness of the small bowel to LPS through reduced secretions and as a result exhibit less bactericidal activity. METHODS: The distal ileum was harvested from Institute of Cancer Research mice, washed, and randomized for incubation with LPS (0, 1, or 10 mug/mL). Culture supernatant was collected and sPLA2 activity was measured. Bactericidal activity of the ileum segment secretions was assessed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with and without an sPLA2 inhibitor at 2 concentrations, 100 nmol/L and 1 mumol/L. Institute of Cancer Research mice were randomized to chow or PN for 5 days. Tissue was collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ileal segments were incubated with LPS (0 or 10 mug/mL). sPLA2 activity and bactericidal activity were measured in secretions from ileal segments. RESULTS: Ileal segments responded to 10 mug/mL LPS with significantly greater sPLA2 activity and bactericidal activity. The bactericidal activity of secretions from LPS stimulated tissue was suppressed 50% and 70%, respectively, with the addition of the sPLA2-inhibitor. Chow displayed greater sPLA2 in the Paneth cell granules and secreted higher levels of sPLA2 than PN before and after LPS. Accordingly, media collected from chow was more bactericidal than PN. IHC confirmed a reduction in Paneth cell granules after PN. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that ileal segments secrete bactericidal secretions after LPS exposure and the inhibition of the Paneth cell antimicrobial protein sPLA2 significantly diminishes this. PN feeding resulted in suppressed secretion of the sPLA2 and resulted in increased bacterial survival. This demonstrates that PN significantly impairs the innate immune response by suppressing Paneth cell function.
TI  - Molecular modeling and active site analysis of SdiA homolog, a putative quorum sensor for Salmonella typhimurium pathogenecity reveals specific binding patterns of AHL transcriptional regulators.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for human diseases including gastroenteritis and typhoid fever and its quorum sensing system is currently being intensively researched. Molecular modeling and binding site analysis of SdiA homolog, a putative quorum sensor of the LuxR family and responsible for S. typhimurium pathogenecity revealed a high structural homology of their active site with three other LuxR family proteins LasR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, TraR from Agrobacterium tumifaciens and CviR from Chromobacterium violaceum. The results show that all the LuxR family proteins harbor three conserved amino acids Tryptophan (W67) and Aspartic acid (D80) for formation of hydrogen bridges and Tyrosine (Y71) for the hydrophobic interactions (corresponding to their position in S. typhimurium SdiA) with acyl homoserine lactones (AHL)-dependent transcriptional regulators. However, in addition to the above conserved residues, Arginine (R60) also plays an important role in S. typhimurium SdiA binding with its AHL auto inducers and the complex is found to be stronger because of the interactions between nitrogen atoms of Arginine with the carbonyl oxygen in the lactone ring of AHL. The specific binding patterns would be helpful in guiding both enzymatic studies as well as design of specific inhibitors to overcome S. typhimurium pathogenecity.
TI  - A novel capture compound for the identification and analysis of cyclic di-GMP binding proteins.
AB  - The second messenger cyclic di-GMP is a near-ubiquitous signaling molecule that globally alters bacterial cell physiology to promote biofilm formation and community behavior. Much progress was made in recent years towards the identification and characterization of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiersterases, enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of this signaling compound. In contrast, our knowledge of the nature and mechanistic details of c-di-GMP effector proteins lags behind, primarily because effective tools for their specific enrichment and rapid analysis are missing. In this report we demonstrate that a novel tri-functional c-di-GMP-specific Capture Compound (cdG-CC) can be effectively used to identify and validate c-di-GMP binding proteins. The cdG-CC was able to specifically and efficiently pull down bona fide c-di-GMP effector proteins. Furthermore, in combination with mass spectrometry (CCMS), this technology robustly identified a substantial fraction of the known c-di-GMP signaling components directly from cell extracts of different model organisms. Finally, we applied the CCMS technique to profile c-di-GMP binding proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Our studies establish CCMS as a powerful and versatile tool to identify and analyze components of the cellular c-di-GMP pathway in a wide range of different organisms.
TI  - Toxicity and antibacterial assessment of chitosan-coated silver nanoparticles on  human pathogens and macrophage cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogenic bacteria are able to develop various strategies to counteract the bactericidal action of antibiotics. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have emerged as a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics because of their potent antimicrobial properties. The purpose of this study was to synthesize chitosan-stabilized AgNPs (CS-AgNPs) and test for their cytotoxic, genotoxic, macrophage cell uptake, antibacterial, and antibiofilm activities. METHODS: AgNPs were synthesized using chitosan as both a stabilizing and a reducing agent. Antibacterial activity was determined by colony-forming unit assay and scanning electron microscopy. Genotoxic and cytotoxic activity were determined by DNA fragmentation, comet, and MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assays. Cellular uptake and intracellular antibacterial activity were tested on macrophages. RESULTS: CS-AgNPs exhibited potent antibacterial activity against different human pathogens and also impeded bacterial biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that CS-AgNPs kill bacteria by disrupting the cell membrane. CS-AgNPs showed no significant cytotoxic or DNA damage effect on macrophages at the bactericidal dose. Propidium iodide staining indicated active endocytosis of CS-AgNPs resulting in reduced intracellular bacterial survival in macrophages. CONCLUSION: The present study concludes that at a specific dose, chitosan-based AgNPs kill bacteria without harming the host cells, thus representing a potential template for the design of antibacterial agents to decrease bacterial colonization and to overcome the problem of drug resistance.
TI  - Caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NCFM enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  - Although the immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved C. elegans host responses. We found that the probiotic Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is not harmful to C. elegans and that L. acidophilus NCFM is unable to colonize the C. elegans intestine. Conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent Enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic strains of E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Preexposure of nematodes to Bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. Importantly, L. acidophilus NCFM activates key immune signaling pathways involved in C. elegans defenses against Gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via TIR-1 and PMK-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via BAR-1). Interestingly, conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM had a minimal effect on Gram-negative infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with Gram-negative pathogens or general stress. In conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM modulates specific C. elegans immunity traits.
TI  - C1 inhibitor suppresses the endotoxic activity of a wide range of lipopolysaccharides and interacts with live gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Human C1 inhibitor (C1INH) prevents endotoxin shock via a direct interaction with Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and improves survival in animal models of sepsis. In this report, we further characterize the interaction of C1INH with LPS and whole live bacteria. We investigate C1INH interactions with LPS from five different strains of Gram-negative enteric bacteria known to participate in the pathogenesis of human sepsis. Treatment with C1INH improved survival in mice with endotoxin shock induced by LPS from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as previously shown, as well as LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a trend to improved survival was observed when Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens LPS were used. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shift experiments demonstrated a direct interaction of C1INH with LPS from all the strains studied. The binding of both native and reactive center-cleaved, inactive C1INH results in inhibition of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of C1INH to bind at the surface of only a restricted number of whole live Gram-negative bacteria as well as mutant bacteria expressing a truncated LPS lacking the O-antigen. These data reveal the interaction of C1INH with a wide range of enteric bacterial LPS and strongly suggest that the interaction between C1INH and the surface of Gram-negative microorganisms is determined by the length of the polysaccharide chain of the endotoxin molecule.
TI  - Prokaryotic selectivity and LPS-neutralizing activity of short antimicrobial peptides designed from the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37.
AB  - To develop novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with shorter lengths, improved prokaryotic selectivity and retained lipolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing activity compared to human cathelicidin AMP, LL-37, a series of amino acid-substituted analogs based on IG-19 (residues 13-31 of LL-37) were synthesized. Among the IG-19 analogs, the analog a4 showed the highest prokaryotic selectivity, but much lower LPS-neutralizing activity compared to parental LL-37. The analogs, a5, a6, a7 and a8 with higher hydrophobicity displayed LPS-neutralizing activity comparable to that of LL-37, but much lesser prokaryotic selectivity. These results indicate that the proper hydrophobicity of the peptides is crucial to exert the amalgamated property of LPS-neutralizing activity and prokaryotic selectivity. Furthermore, to increase LPS-neutralizing activity of the analog a4 without a remarkable decrease in prokaryotic selectivity, we synthesized Trp-substituted analogs (a4-W1 and a4-W2), in which Phe(5) or Phe(15) of a4 is replaced by Trp. Despite their same prokaryotic selectivity, a4-W2 displayed much higher LPS-neutralizing activity compared to a4-W1. When compared with parental LL-37, a4-W2 showed retained LPS-neutralizing activity and 2.8-fold enhanced prokaryotic selectivity. These results suggest that the effective site for Trp-substitution when designing novel AMPs with higher LPS-neutralizing activity, without a remarkable reduction in prokaryotic selectivity, is the amphipathic interface between the end of the hydrophilic side and the start of the hydrophobic side rather than the central position of the hydrophobic side in their alpha-helical wheel projection. Taken together, the analog a4-W2 can serve as a promising template for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of endotoxic shock and bacterial infection.
TI  - Altering the communication networks of multispecies microbial systems using a diverse toolbox of AI-2 analogues.
AB  - There have been intensive efforts to find small molecule antagonists for bacterial quorum sensing (QS) mediated by the "universal" QS autoinducer, AI-2. Previous work has shown that linear and branched acyl analogues of AI-2 can selectively modulate AI-2 signaling in bacteria. Additionally, LsrK-dependent phosphorylated analogues have been implicated as the active inhibitory form against AI-2 signaling. We used these observations to synthesize an expanded and diverse array of AI-2 analogues, which included aromatic as well as cyclic C-1-alkyl analogues. Species-specific analogues that disrupted AI-2 signaling in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were identified. Similarly, analogues that disrupted QS behaviors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found. Moreover, we observed a strong correlation between LsrK-dependent phosphorylation of these acyl analogues and their ability to suppress QS. Significantly, we demonstrate that these analogues can selectively antagonize QS in single bacterial strains in a physiologically relevant polymicrobial culture.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Emergence and stability of high-pressure resistance in different food-borne pathogens.
AB  - High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing is becoming a valuable nonthermal food pasteurization technique, although there is reasonable concern that bacterial HHP resistance could compromise the safety and stability of HHP-processed foods. While the degree of natural HHP resistance has already been shown to vary greatly among and within bacterial species, a still unresolved question remains as to what extent different food-borne pathogens can actually develop HHP resistance. In this study, we therefore examined and compared the intrinsic potentials for HHP resistance development among strains of Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria innocua using a selective enrichment approach. Interestingly, of all strains examined, the acquisition of extreme HHP resistance could be detected in only some of the E. coli strains, indicating that a specific genetic predisposition might be required for resistance development. Furthermore, once acquired, HHP resistance proved to be a very stable trait that was maintained for >80 generations in the absence of HHP exposure. Finally, at the mechanistic level, HHP resistance was not necessarily linked to derepression of the heat shock genes and was not related to the phenomenon of persistence.
TI  - NLRC4 inflammasomes in dendritic cells regulate noncognate effector function by memory CD8(+) T cells.
AB  - Memory T cells exert antigen-independent effector functions, but how these responses are regulated is unclear. We discovered an in vivo link between flagellin-induced NLRC4 inflammasome activation in splenic dendritic cells (DCs) and host protective interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by noncognate memory CD8(+) T cells, which could be activated by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that CD8alpha(+) DCs were particularly efficient at sensing bacterial flagellin through NLRC4 inflammasomes. Although this activation released interleukin 18 (IL-18) and IL-1beta, only IL-18 was required for IFN-gamma production by memory CD8(+) T cells. Conversely, only the release of IL-1beta, but not IL-18, depended on priming signals mediated by Toll-like receptors. These findings provide a comprehensive mechanistic framework for the regulation of noncognate memory T cell responses during bacterial immunity.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of UV treatment and a combination of UV and dry heat against pathogens on stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces.
AB  - Pathogens that contaminate the surfaces of food utensils may contribute to the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks. We investigated the efficacy of UV treatment combined with dry heat (50 degrees C) for inhibiting 5 foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) on stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces in this study. We inoculated substrates with each of the 5 foodborne pathogens cultured on agar surface and then UV treatment alone or a combination of both UV and dry heat (50 degrees C) was applied for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h. The initial populations of the 5 pathogens before treatment were 8.02 to 9.18 and 8.73 to 9.16 log(1)(0) CFU/coupon on the surfaces of stainless steel and polypropylene coupons, respectively. UV treatments for 3 h significantly inhibited S. Typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus on the stainless steel by 3.06, 2.18, and 2.70 log(1)(0) CFU/coupon, and S. aureus on the polypropylene by 3.11 log(1)(0) CFU/coupon, respectively. The inhibitory effects of the combined UV and dry heat treatment (50 degrees C) increased as treatment time increased, yielding significant reductions in all samples treated for 3 h, with the exception of S. aureus on polypropylene. The reduction level of E. coli O157:H7 treated for 3 h on the surface of stainless steel and polypropylene treated was approximately 6.00 log(1)(0) CFU/coupon. These results indicate that combined UV and dry heat (50 degrees C) treatments may be effective for controlling microbial contamination on utensils and cooking equipment surfaces as well as in other related environments.
TI  - The role of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Active efflux proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are thought to have a protective role in the intestinal tract by preventing xenotoxin absorption. Some bacteria also need to adhere to the intestinal tract before causing disease through adhesin secretion. Thus, this study was initiated to examine whether any association exists between bacterial adhesion. METHODS: Three human cell lines (Caco2, RKO, and MCF7), and 6 species of bacteria were used in this study (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium sporogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Following incubation of our cells with active efflux inhibitors, bacteria incubated with a stable fluorescent dye were co-incubated at 37 degrees C for various times up to 240min. Fluorescence intensity was used to compare bacterial attachment to these cell lines with either normal efflux protein expression or with induction or inhibition of efflux proteins. RESULTS: P-gp inhibition by either PSC-833 or GF120918 resulted in a significant increase of all bacterial attachment to Caco2 cells up to 3 fold. RKO cells and MCF7 cells did not alter their bacterial attachment with PSC-833. Fumitremorgen C, a dedicated BCRP inhibitor had no effect. In addition, rifampicin, a P-gp inducer, resulted in some limited reduction in Salmonella and Klebsiella attachment only. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate P-gp expression may contribute to the resistance of potential bacterial toxicity, by preventing them adhering to human enterocytes cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which may reduce the risk or intensity of gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Developing next generation antimicrobials by intercepting AI-2 mediated quorum sensing.
AB  - Bacteria have been evolving antibiotic resistance since their discovery in the early twentieth century. Most new antibiotics are derivatives of older generations and there are now bacteria that are virtually resistant to almost all antibiotics. This poses a global threat to human health and has been classified as a clinical "super-challenge", which has necessitated research into new antimicrobials that inhibit bacterial virulence while minimizing selective pressures that lead to the emergence of resistant strains. Quorum sensing (QS), the process of population dependent bacterial cell-cell signaling, can accelerate bacterial virulence and is an increasingly interesting target for developing next generation antimicrobials. Most QS inhibitors target species-specific signals, such as acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and oligopeptides. Methodologies for intercepting the cross-species signal, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), have only recently emerged. We review these strategies to prevent the relay of the AI-2 signal amongst pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhibition mechanisms are categorized based on the target (i.e., enzymes for signal generation, the signal molecule itself, or the various components of the signal transduction process). The universal nature of the AI-2 signal imparts on its inhibitors the potential for broad spectrum use.
TI  - WFDC2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
AB  - WAP four disulfide core domain 2 (WFDC2) is a four disulfide core (4-DSC) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. It is comprised of two 4-DSC domains assigned domain III at the NH2-terminal end and domain II at the COOH-terminal end. The WFDC2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. The WFDC2 protein showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain II. There was no antibacterial activity detected against Enterococcus faecalis. The observed expression pattern of tammar WFDC2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by S. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. The latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as E. faecalis.
TI  - Imaging and analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa swarming and rhamnolipid production.
AB  - Many bacteria spread over surfaces by "swarming" in groups. A problem for scientists who study swarming is the acquisition of statistically significant data that distinguish two observations or detail the temporal patterns and two-dimensional heterogeneities that occur. It is currently difficult to quantify differences between observed swarm phenotypes. Here, we present a method for acquisition of temporal surface motility data using time-lapse fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging. We specifically demonstrate three applications of our technique with the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. First, we quantify the temporal distribution of P. aeruginosa cells tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the surfactant rhamnolipid stained with the lipid dye Nile red. Second, we distinguish swarming of P. aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in a coswarming experiment. Lastly, we quantify differences in swarming and rhamnolipid production of several P. aeruginosa strains. While the best swarming strains produced the most rhamnolipid on surfaces, planktonic culture rhamnolipid production did not correlate with surface growth rhamnolipid production.
TI  - Bacterial transformation using micro-shock waves.
AB  - Shock waves are one of the most competent mechanisms of energy dissipation observed in nature. We have developed a novel device to generate controlled micro-shock waves using an explosive-coated polymer tube. In this study, we harnessed these controlled micro-shock waves to develop a unique bacterial transformation method. The conditions were optimized for the maximum transformation efficiency in Escherichia coli. The maximum transformation efficiency was obtained when we used a 30 cm length polymer tube, 100 mum thick metal foil, 200 mM CaCl(2), 1 ng/mul plasmid DNA concentration, and 1x10(9) cell density. The highest transformation efficiency achieved (1x10(-5) transformants/cell) was at least 10 times greater than the previously reported ultrasound-mediated transformation (1x10(-6) transformants/cell). This method was also successfully employed for the efficient and reproducible transformation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. This novel method of transformation was shown to be as efficient as electroporation with the added advantage of better recovery of cells, reduced cost (40 times cheaper than a commercial electroporator), and growth phase independent transformation.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of highly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens by a natural product.
AB  - The continuous escalation of resistant bacteria against a wide range of antibiotics necessitates discovering novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. B. oleracea L (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. However, it has not been researched adequately for its antimicrobial activity on potential resistant pathogens. The methanol crude extract of B. oleracea L. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. The screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. It was followed by evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Moreover, the antibacterial and the antifungal activities were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), respectively. Remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, Trichophyton rubrum and Aspergillus terreus. Red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being the most abundant class, which might explain its potent antimicrobial action. This extract is potentially novel for future antimicrobials, inexpensive, and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies for further investigation and processing.
TI  - Evaluation of Abelmoschus moschatus extracts for antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities using in vitro assays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abelmoschus moschatus Medik. leaves and seeds are considered as valuable traditional medicine. The aromatic seeds of this plant are aphrodisiac, ophthalmic, cardio tonic, antispasmodic and used in the treatment of intestinal complaints and check queasiness. To give a scientific basis for traditional usage of this medicinal plant, the seed and leaf extracts were evaluated for their antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. METHODS: In this study, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of A. moschatus extracts were evaluated in a series of in vitro assay involving free radicals, reactive oxygen species and their IC50 values were also determined. The antioxidant activities of the seed and leaf extracts of A. moschatus were determined by total antioxidant, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. In addition, the antiproliferative activity was also evaluated using colorectal adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma human cancer cell lines. Moreover, six bacterial reference strains, two gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), four gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella enterica paratyphi) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: The results from this study showed that the antioxidant activities of A. moschatus as determined by the total phenol, flavonoids, total antioxidant and FRAP methods were higher in leaf than that of the seed extracts. On the other hand, the aqueous overnight seed extract (AMS-I) has shown significant radical scavenging activity as in 1, 1- Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide and lipid peroxidation as compared to other seed and leaf extracts. The AMS-I and AML-IV have shown activity against six and seven microorganisms respectively. Simulteneously, AMS-IV and AML-IV have demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against two human cell lines - Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COLO-205) and retinoblastoma (Y79). CONCLUSION: The seed and leaf extracts of A. moschatus possess significant antioxidant activity and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger, or substitute, probably as primary antioxidants. The plant possesses moderate antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in this study. Hydroalcoholic seed and leaf extracts also exhibited antiproliferative activity against two human cancer cell lines. A. moschatus may therefore, be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutics.
TI  - Extreme antimicrobial Peptide and polymyxin B resistance in the genus burkholderia.
AB  - Cationic antimicrobial peptides and polymyxins are a group of naturally occurring antibiotics that can also possess immunomodulatory activities. They are considered a new source of antibiotics for treating infections by bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Members of the genus Burkholderia, which includes various human pathogens, are inherently resistant to antimicrobial peptides. The resistance is several orders of magnitude higher than that of other Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This review summarizes our current understanding of antimicrobial peptide and polymyxin B resistance in the genus Burkholderia. These bacteria possess major and minor resistance mechanisms that will be described in detail. Recent studies have revealed that many other emerging Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens may also be inherently resistant to antimicrobial peptides and polymyxins and we propose that Burkholderia sp. are a model system to investigate the molecular basis of the resistance in extremely resistant bacteria. Understanding resistance in these types of bacteria will be important if antimicrobial peptides come to be used regularly for the treatment of infections by susceptible bacteria because this may lead to increased resistance in the species that are currently susceptible and may also open up new niches for opportunistic pathogens with high inherent resistance.
TI  - Regulating iron storage and metabolism with RNA: an overview of posttranscriptional controls of intracellular iron homeostasis.
AB  - Iron (Fe) is a double-edged sword for most living organisms. Although it is essential for the catalytic activity of a large number of enzymes, ferrous iron (Fe(2+) ) becomes cytotoxic in the presence of normal respiratory by-products such as H(2) O(2) . Because of this toxicity, intracellular iron concentrations ought to be regulated by elaborated homeostasis systems that, despite decades of extensive studies, have not yet revealed all of their surprising arrays of mechanistic details. Within the last few years, our understanding of iron metabolism has revealed that posttranscriptional regulation represents a major contribution to iron homeostasis in a host of organisms. While the small RNA RyhB regulates iron homeostasis in bacteria, its functional homolog protein Cth2 performs a similar task in yeasts. Recent advances in the elucidation of the mechanism of action and functions of RyhB have been made in Escherichia coli. In addition, other RyhB-like small RNAs have been identified in several bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Shigella spp. These recent findings have shed light on the complexity of iron homeostasis.
TI  - Optimization of a sample preparation method for the metabolomic analysis of clinically relevant bacteria.
AB  - Metabolomics, or metabolite profiling, is an approach that is increasingly used to study the metabolism of diverse organisms, elucidate biological processes and/or find characteristic biomarkers of physiological states. Here, we describe the optimization of a method for global metabolomic analysis of bacterial cultures, with the following steps. Cells are grown to log-phase, starting from an overnight culture and bacterial concentrations are monitored by measuring the optical density of the cultures at 600 nm. At an appropriate density they are harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with NaCl solution and metabolites are extracted using methanol and a bead-mill. Dried extracts are methoxymated and derivatized with methyltrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) then analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-MS/TOF). Finally, patterns in the acquired data are examined by multivariate data modeling. This method enabled us to obtain reproducible metabolite profiles of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, with about 25% compound identification, based on comparison with entries in available GC-MS libraries. To assess the potential utility of the method for comparative analysis of other bacterial species we analyzed cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Multivariate analysis of the acquired data showed that it was possible to differentiate the species according to their metabolic profiles. Our results show that the presented procedure can be used for metabolomic analysis of a wide range of bacterial species of clinical interest.
TI  - Essential oils from Moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. Antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important Gram-negative pathogens. Use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). The objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. This activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN). The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in Salmonella LPS deep-rough mutants. In addition, essential oils of Thymus maroccanus and Thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. These results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.
TI  - Identification and biological activity of potential probiotic bacterium isolated  from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb.
AB  - The lactic acid bacterium E isolated from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb was identified by sequencing of 16S rDNA fragment and species-specific PCR as Lactobacillus reuteri. Its potential antimicrobial activity and ability to modulate immune system in vitro and in vivo was determined. The growth inhibition of potential pathogens decreased from Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica ser. Minnesota to Escherichia coli. The lowest inhibition activity was observed in the case of Candida albicans. The ability of L. reuteri E to modulate biological activities of human and mouse mononuclear cells was estimated in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The production of IL-1beta by monocytes in vitro was significantly induced by L. reuteri E (relative activity 2.47). The ability to modulate biological activities of mononuclear cells by living L. reuteri E cells in vitro in comparison to disintegrated L. reuteri E cells in vivo differed. For example lysozyme activity in vitro was inhibited while in vivo was stimulated (relative activities 0.30 and 1.83, respectively). The peroxidase activity in vitro was stimulated while in vivo was inhibited (relative activities 1.53 and 0.17, respectively). Obtained results indicate that L. reuteri E is potential candidate to be used in probiotic preparations for animals and/or human.
TI  - Innate immunity: unfolding the neuro-immuno connections.
AB  - The innate immune system maintains health and fitness during infection by eliminating infectious agents and by limiting damage caused by pathogens or immune activation. The nervous system contributes to innate immunity by modulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides and by regulating the unfolded protein response.
TI  - A retrospective study of post-mortem examination findings in takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri).
AB  - AIMS: To identify the major diseases or disease processes affecting both captive  and wild populations of takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) in birds submitted for post-mortem examination between 1992 and 2007, and to survey archived wild dead takahe for the presence of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. METHODS: Reports of 199 post-mortem examinations submitted between 1992 and 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. The reports comprised 56 eggs, 51 chicks up to 6 months of age, 13 sub-adults 6-18 months old, 74 adults and five birds where age was not recorded. Bone marrow flushed from the keel of 34 frozen adult takahe was assayed for the presence of E. rhusiopathiae, using PCR analysis. RESULTS: Of the eggs examined, 6/56 (11%) had no recorded diagnosis, 24/56 (43%) were infertile and 26/56 (46%) showed embryonic mortality at various stages. Excluding eggs, the cause of death could not be determined in 64/138 (46%) birds with a recorded age that were examined. Contributing factors for the low rate of diagnosis included advanced decomposition of many carcasses, the freezing of some birds prior to pathological investigation, long delays between recovery and submission for post-mortem examination, and variation in the extent of post-mortem examination and ancillary diagnostic testing. Common post-mortem examination findings in chicks included those related to cardiac disease [11/51 (22%)], infectious or inflammatory disease [9/51 (18%)] and trauma [7/51 (14%)]. In adult birds, the most common post-mortem examination findings were due to infectious or inflammatory disease [15/74 (20%)] including septicaemia due to E. rhusiopathiae [3/74 (7%)], followed by degenerative conditions due to diet, age and husbandry [9/74 (12%)]. Bacteria implicated in the causes of death included Escherichia coli, E. rhusiopathiae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only 1/34 (3%) of the frozen carcass examined using PCR was positive for E. rhusiopathiae. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a need for improved recovery, storage and submission of dead takahe for pathological examination; consistency in post-mortem examination, ancillary testing and recording of findings; and finally, regular communication between wildlife pathologists, conservation workers and representatives of Ngai Tahu.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological properties of thienyl derived triazole Schiff bases and their oxovanadium(IV) complexes.
AB  - A new series of biologically active thienyl derived triazole Schiff bases and their oxovanadium(IV) complexes have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of physical (m.p., magnetic susceptibility and conductivity), spectral (IR, (1)H and (1)(3)C NMR, electronic and mass spectrometry) and microanalytical data. All the Schiff base ligands and their oxovanadium(IV) complexes have been subjected to in vitro antibacterial activity against four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serover typhi) and two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) bacterial strains and, for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifucus, Candida albican, Aspergillus flavus, Microscopum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. Brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to check the cytotoxic nature of these compounds.
TI  - Isolation of Salmonella paratyphi A from a female with diabetic foot ulcer.
AB  
TI  - Growth of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of quorum sensing signalling compounds produced by spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) and autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signalling compounds present in the cell-free culture supernatants (CFS), of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica-like GTE 112, Serratia proteamaculans 00612, Y. enterocolitica CITY650 and Y. enterocolitica CITY844, on the growth of two Salmonella Enteritidis and two S. Typhimurium strains was assessed though monitoring of changes in conductance of the medium. Detection times (T(det)), area and slope of conductance curves were recorded. Except for P. aeruginosa 108928, which was not found to produce AI-2, all other strains produced both AHLs and AI-2. Thereafter, aliquots (20% in the final volume) of these CFS were transferred into NZ Amine broth inoculated with ca. 10(3) CFU/ml of stationary phase cultures of each Salmonella strain. While the CFS of P. aeruginosa induced a shorter detection time, i.e. acceleration of the metabolic activity, the CFS of the other microorganisms increased the detection time of Salmonella strains compared to control samples (i.e. without CFS). Results indicate that the growth of Salmonella may be affected by the presence of Quorum sensing (QS) signalling compounds and/or other novel signals existing in CFS, produced by other bacterial species and confirm the complexity of bacterial communication.

TI  - N-Benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a New Class of Bacterial DNA Gyrase Inhibitors.
AB  - This paper characterizes N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Gyramide A was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. In this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified DNA gyrase as the primary target of gyramide A. The gyramide A resistance-determining region in DNA gyrase is adjacent to the DNA cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. We studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides A-C in combination with the Gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor MC-207,110 (60 muM). The gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 muM against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against Enterococcus faecalis. The IC(50) of gyramides A-C against E. coli DNA gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 muM. The N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in DNA gyrase.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of 2-hydroxy-2-aryl-2,3-dihydro-imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts and 2N-substituted 4(5)-aryl-2-amino-1H-imidazoles as inhibitors of biofilm formation by Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A library of 80 1-substituted 2-hydroxy-2-aryl-2,3-dihydro-imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts and 54 2N-substituted 4(5)-aryl-2-amino-1H-imidazoles was synthesized and tested for the antagonistic effect against biofilm formation by Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The nature of the substituent at the 1-position of the salts was found to have a major effect on their biofilm inhibitory activity. Salts with an intermediate length n-alkyl or cyclo-alkyl chain (C7-C10) substituted at the 1-position in general prevented the biofilm formation of both species at low micromolar concentrations, while salts with a shorter n-alkyl or cyclo-alkyl chain (C1-C5) or longer n-alkyl chain (C11-C14) were much less potent. Salts with a long cyclo-alkyl chain however were found to be strong biofilm inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrated the biofilm inhibitory potential of salts with certain aromatic substituents at the 1-position, such as piperonyl or 3-methoxyphenetyl. The activity of the 2-aminomidazoles was found to be dependent on the nature of the 2N-substituent. Compounds with a n-butyl, iso-butyl, n-pentyl, cyclo-pentyl or n-hexyl chain at the 2N-position have an improved activity as compared to their unsubstituted counterparts, whereas compounds with shorter 2N-alkyl chains do have a reduced activity and compounds with longer 2N-alkyl chains do have an effect that is dependent on the nature of the substitution pattern of the 4(5)-phenyl ring. Finally, we demonstrated that introduction of a 3-methoxyphenethyl or piperonyl group at the 2N-position of the imidazoles could also result in an enhanced biofilm inhibition.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of 3-butenyl, 4-pentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate in Brassica vegetables.
AB  - This study investigated antibacterial activities of 4 isothiocyanates (3-butenyl, 4-phentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate) against 4 Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) and 7 Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleaesuis, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) by an agar disc diffusion assay. Benzyl isothiocyanate (> 90.00 mm inhibition zone diameter at 0.1 muL/mL) and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (58.33 mm at 0.2 muL/mL) showed large inhibition zones especially against B. cereus. Also, 3-butenyl isothiocyanate (21.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate (19.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) displayed potent antibacterial activity against A. hydrophila. Benzyl and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate indicated higher activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria than 3-butenyl and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate, and were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of low-copy genetic targets for waterborne bacterial pathogen detection via qPCR.
AB  - Recent developments in water quality research have highlighted difficulties in accurately predicting the incidence of pathogens within freshwater based on the viability, culturability and metabolic activity of indicator organisms. QPCR-driven assays are candidates to replace standard culture-based methods, however, protocols suitable for routine use have yet to be sufficiently validated. The objective of this study was to evaluate five oligonucleotide primers sets (ETIR, SINV, exoT, VS1 and ipaH2) for their potential applicability in qPCR assays to detect contamination from five waterborne bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella flexneri). An enrichment-free qPCR protocol was also tested using S. Typhimurium-seeded source water, combining membrane filtration and mechanical, chemical and enzymatic lysis techniques to recover the bacterial cells. All five primer sets were found to have high specificity and sensitivity for the tested organisms. Four of the primers were able to detect pathogen loads as low as 10 cells/mL while 200 cells/mL of C. jejuni were detectable in pure culture. Although sensitivity decreased in an artificially contaminated environmental matrix, it was still possible to detect as few as 10 S. Typhimurium cells without enrichment. The primers and protocols evaluated in this study have demonstrated potential for further validation for possible application alongside traditional indicator techniques.
TI  - Mechanisms for maintaining cell shape in rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - For the rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, changes in cell shape have critical consequences for motility, immune system evasion, proliferation and adhesion. For most bacteria, the peptidoglycan cell wall is both necessary and sufficient to determine cell shape. However, how the synthesis machinery assembles a peptidoglycan network with a robustly maintained micron-scale shape has remained elusive. To explore shape maintenance, we have quantified the robustness of cell shape in three Gram-negative bacteria in different genetic backgrounds and in the presence of an antibiotic that inhibits division. Building on previous modelling suggesting a prominent role for mechanical forces in shape regulation, we introduce a biophysical model for the growth dynamics of rod-shaped cells to investigate the roles of spatial regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis, glycan-strand biochemistry and mechanical stretching during insertion. Our studies reveal that rod-shape maintenance requires insertion to be insensitive to fluctuations in cell-wall density and stress, and even a simple helical pattern of insertion is sufficient for over sixfold elongation without significant loss in shape. In addition, we demonstrate that both the length and pre-stretching of newly inserted strands regulate cell width. In sum, we show that simple physical rules can allow bacteria to achieve robust, shape-preserving cell-wall growth.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - CONTEXT: Development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. Twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. Eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. Powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Water extract of Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of Ficus carica L. (Moraceae) and Olea europaea L. (Oleaceae) leaves and Peganum harmala L. (Nitrariaceae) seeds had MIC ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. S. aromaticum inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. F. carica and O. europaea inhibited growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. pyogenes whereas P. harmala was effective against S. aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Candida albicans. Ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had MIC >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal Salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("MAMEF").
AB  - Certain serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. A rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. An innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). We have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oriC locus common to all Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. We have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of Salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. Following lysis and DNA release, as little as 1 CFU of Salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. Furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oriC from Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi C, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Choleraesuis but does not detect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Acinetobacter baumanii. We have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic Salmonella oriC oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with PBS. These pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect Salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).
TI  - Identification and discrimination of bacterial strains by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy and neural networks.
AB  - A method based on laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and neural networks (NNs) has been developed and applied to the identification and discrimination of specific bacteria strains (Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium). Instant identification of the samples is achieved using a spectral library, which was obtained by analysis using a single laser pulse of representative samples and treatment by neural networks. The samples used in this study were divided into three groups, which were prepared on three different days. The results obtained allow the identification of the bacteria tested with a certainty of over 95%, and show that only a difference between the bacteria can cause identification. Single-shot measurements were sufficient for clear identification of the bacterial strains studied. The method can be developed for automatic real time, fast, reliable and robust measurements and can be packaged in portable systems for non-specialist users.
TI  - Corn flake-like morphology of iron nanoparticles and its antibacterial property.

TI  - Effect of acidic pH on antibacterial action of peptide isolated from Korean pen shell (Atrina pectinata).
AB  - Recently, the rapid emergence of microbial pathogens which are resistant to currently available antibiotics has triggered considerable interest searching for naturally occuring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Because AMPs from food organisms are comparatively nontoxic, a number of them are used as sources, purified in new antibiotics. Herein, an antibacterial peptide (heat-stable KPS-1) was isolated from Korean pen shell (Atrina pectinata) by the following procedures: solvent-extraction, heating, ultrafiltration, and RP-HPLC. The molecular weight of KPS-1 (4549.1 Da) was revealed by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. Interestingly, KPS-1 inhibited in vitro growth of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, E. coli O157, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Salmonella typhimurium, at pH 5.2, rather than at pH 7.2. Its minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were ranged from 20 to 80 microg/ml; however, it was not effective against human red blood cells at a concentration of 500 microg/ml. This suggests that this peptide is useful as a clinical agent for some human organs in an acidic environment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the enniatin B, produced by Fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The enniatins (ENs) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of Fusarium sp. The EN B was purified from extracts of Fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (PDB), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (LC) followed by an analytical LC. The purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study. The pure fraction of EN B was utilized to determine the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, EN B induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms tested and no significant differences over control were detected when Caco-2 cells were exposed to EN B, at any of the concentrations used.
TI  - The Vi conjugate typhoid vaccine is safe, elicits protective levels of IgG anti-Vi, and is compatible with routine infant vaccines.
AB  - Typhoid fever remains a serious problem in developing countries. Current vaccines are licensed for individuals who are 5 years old or older. A conjugate of the capsular polysaccharide (CP) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Vi) bound to recombinant exoprotein A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Vi-rEPA) enhanced Vi immunogenicity and protected 2- to 5-year-olds in Vietnam. In this study, Vi-rEPA was evaluated for use in infants. A total of 301 full-term Vietnamese infants received Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines alone or with Vi-rEPA or Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Hib-TT) at 2, 4, and 6 months and Vi-rEPA or Hib-TT alone at 12 months. Infants were visited 6, 24, and 48 h after each injection to monitor adverse reactions. Maternal, cord, and infant sera were assayed for IgG anti-Vi and for IgG antibodies to Hib CP and the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis toxins at 7, 12, and 13 months. No vaccine-related serious adverse reactions occurred. In the Vi-rEPA group, the IgG anti-Vi geometric mean (GM) increased from the cord level of 0.66 to 17.4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) at 7 months, declined to 4.76 EU at 12 months, and increased to 50.1 EU 1 month after the 4th dose (95% of infants had levels of >/= 3.5 EU, the estimated protective level). Controls had no increase of the IgG anti-Vi GM. Infants with cord anti-Vi levels of <3.5 EU responded with significantly higher IgG anti-Vi levels than those with levels of >/= 3.5 EU. Anti-diphtheria, -tetanus, and -pertussis toxin levels were similar in all groups. Vi-rEPA was safe, induced protective anti-Vi levels, and was compatible with EPI vaccines, and it can be used in infants. High cord IgG anti-Vi levels partially suppressed infant responses to Vi-rEPA.
TI  - Chemical constituents of Talauma arcabucoana (Magnoliaceae): their brine shrimp lethality and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A new aporphine alkaloid, (-)-arcabucoine [(6aR)-N-formyl-1,2-methylenedioxy-9,10-dimethoxy-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4H-dibenzo[ de,g]quinoline] 1 was isolated from the leaves of Talauma arcabucoana (Magnoliaceae), along with the known compounds (-)-erythro-saccharinic acid lactone 2 and (-)-shikimic acid 3. Furthermore, the known aporphine alkaloids (-)-dicentrine 4, (-)-nordicentrine 5 and dicentrinone 6 were isolated from the stem bark. The alkaloids 4 and 5 were found to be the most active compounds in a brine shrimp lethality assay. In addition, alkaloids 1, 4 and 5 showed moderate growth inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.
TI  - [Left-sided endocarditis due to gram-negative bacilli: epidemiology and clinical  characteristics].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological, clinical  characteristics, and outcome of patients with left-side endocarditis caused by gram-negative bacteria. METHOD: Prospective multicenter study of left-sided infective endocarditis reported in the Andalusian Cohort for the Study of Cardiovascular Infections between 1984 and 2008. RESULTS: Among the 961 endocarditis, 24 (2.5%) were caused by gram-negative bacilli. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica. Native valves (85.7%) were mainly affected, most of them with previous valve damage (57%). Comorbidity was greater (90% vs 39%; P=.05) than in endocarditis due to other microorganism, the most frequent being, diabetes, hepatic cirrhosis and neoplasm. A previous manipulation was found in 47.6% of the cases, and 37% were considered hospital-acquired. Renal failure (41%), central nervous system involvement (33%) and ventricular dysfunction (45%) were the most frequent complications. Five cases (21%) required cardiac surgery, mostly due to ventricular dysfunction. More than 50% of cases were treated with aminoglycosides, but this did not lead to a better outcome or prognosis. Mortality (10 patients) was higher than that reported with other microorganisms (41% vs 35%; P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: Left-sided endocarditis due to gram-negative bacilli is a rare disease, which affects patients with major morbidities and often with a previous history of hospital manipulations. Cardiac, neurological and renal complications are frequent and associated with a high mortality. The association of aminoglycosides in the antimicrobial treatment did not involve a better outcome or prognosis.
TI  - Triplex PCR for the simultaneous detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Helicobacter hepaticus, and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The accurate and economical diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria is necessary for the microbiological control of laboratory animals. In this study, we developed a triplex PCR method for the direct detection of three common gastroenteric bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Helicobacter hepaticus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Targets were specifically amplified by conventional PCR assay using a genomic fragment from P. aeruginosa, 16S ribosomal RNA from H. hepaticus, and the invA gene from S. typhimurium. To investigate the specificity of our primers, they were tested against purified DNA from many other bacterial species. There were no amplification products from other bacteria. Under optimized conditions, the triplex assay simultaneously yielded a 726-bp product from P. aeruginosa, a 417-bp product from H. hepaticus, and a 246-bp product from S. typhimurium. The detection limits of this assay in pure culture were 10 pg for P. aeruginosa, and 0.1 pg for H. hepaticus and S. typhimurium. All three bacteria were successfully detected in the liver, cecum, and feces of experimentally infected mice. This method is a useful and convenient assay that allows the simultaneous identification of bacterial pathogens in mice. Our triplex method will be used to improve quality control in the detection of pathogenic bacterial infections in laboratory animal facilities.
TI  - The activity of bacteriocins from Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL307 against gram-negative bacteria in combination with EDTA treatment.
AB  - Bacteriocins from gram-positive bacteria are potent antimicrobial peptides that inhibit pathogenic and food-spoilage bacteria. They are usually ineffective against gram-negative bacteria because they cannot penetrate the outer membrane (OM). Disruption of the OM of some gram-negative bacteria was reported to sensitize them to certain bacteriocins. This study evaluates the activity of three purified bacteriocins [carnocyclin A (CclA), carnobacteriocin BM1 (CbnBM1) and piscicolin 126 (PisA)] produced by Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL307, which has been approved for preservation of food in United States and Canada, against three gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli DH5alpha, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 14207 and Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 23564). Their efficacy is compared with bacteriocins of other classes: the lantibiotics nisin A (positive control) and gallidermin, and the cyclic peptide subtilosin A (SubA). In combination with EDTA, CclA inhibited both E. coli and Pseudomonas. PisA inhibited Pseudomonas, but CbnBM1 showed weak activity toward Pseudomonas. In comparison, nisin and gallidermin inhibited the growth of all three strains, whereas SubA was active against E. coli and Pseudomonas only at high concentrations. The results reveal that UAL307 bacteriocins can inhibit gram-negative bacteria if the OM is weakened, and that the different classes of bacteriocins in this study exert unique modes of action toward such bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial sesquiterpene lactone glucoside from seed pods of Bauhinia retusa.
AB  - From the seed pods of Bauhinia retusa, a new eudesmane sesquiterpene glucoside, 1-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-9beta,15-dihydroxy-5alpha,6betaH-eudesma-3-ene-6alpha,1 2-olide (1), has been isolated together with three known compounds, 4'-hydroxy-7-methoxy flavane (2), beta-sitosterol (3), and stigmasterol (4). The structures of isolated compounds were verified with the help of 1D, 2D NMR, and HR-ESI-MS spectroscopies. Compound 1 showed moderate antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli when a disc diffusion method is used.
TI  - Evaluation of the immunogenicity and biological activity of the Citrobacter freundii Vi-CRM197 conjugate as a vaccine for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi.
AB  - Typhoid fever remains a major health problem in developing countries. Young children are at high risk, and a vaccine effective for this age group is urgently needed. Purified capsular polysaccharide from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Vi) is licensed as a vaccine, providing 50 to 70% protection in individuals older than 5 years. However, this vaccine is ineffective in infants. Vi conjugated to a carrier protein (i.e., an exoprotein A mutant from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [rEPA]) is highly immunogenic, provides long-term protection, and shows more than 90% protective efficacy in children 2 to 5 years old. Here, we describe an alternative glycoconjugate vaccine for S. Typhi, Vi-CRM(197), where Vi was obtained from Citrobacter freundii WR7011 and CRM(197), the mutant diphtheria toxin protein, was used as the carrier. We investigated the optimization of growth conditions for Vi production from C. freundii WR7011 and the immunogenicity of Vi-CRM(197) conjugates in mice. The optimal saccharide/protein ratio of the glycoconjugates was identified for the best antibody production. We also demonstrated the ability of this new vaccine to protect mice against challenge with Vi-positive Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
TI  - Medicinal plant extracts with efflux inhibitory activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - It was hypothesised that extracts from plants that are used as herbal medicinal products contain inhibitors of efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. Extracts from 21 plants were screened by bioassay for synergy with ciprofloxacin against Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, including mutants in which acrB and tolC had been inactivated. The most active extracts, fractions and purified compounds were further examined by minimum inhibitory concentration testing with five antibiotics for activity against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efflux activity was determined using the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342. Eighty-four extracts from 21 plants, 12 fractions thereof and 2 purified molecules were analysed. Of these, 12 plant extracts showed synergy with ciprofloxacin, 2 of which had activity suggesting efflux inhibition. The most active extract, from Levisticum officinale, was fractionated and the two fractions displaying the greatest synergy with the five antibiotics were further analysed. From these two fractions, falcarindiol and the fatty acids oleic acid and linoleic acid were isolated. The fractions and compounds possessed antibacterial activity especially for mutants lacking a component of AcrAB-TolC. However, no synergism was seen with the fractions or purified molecules, suggesting that a combination of compounds is required for efflux inhibition. These data indicate that medicinal plant extracts may provide suitable lead compounds for future development and possible clinical utility as inhibitors of efflux for various Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Control of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by FtsH-mediated proteolysis of LpxC is conserved in enterobacteria but not in all gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Despite the essential function of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria, it is largely unknown how the exact amount of this molecule in the outer membrane is controlled. The first committed step in LPS biosynthesis is catalyzed by the LpxC enzyme. In Escherichia coli, the cellular concentration of LpxC is adjusted by the only essential protease in this organism, the membrane-anchored metalloprotease FtsH. Turnover of E. coli LpxC requires a length- and sequence-specific C-terminal degradation signal. LpxC proteins from Salmonella, Yersinia, and Vibrio species carry similar C-terminal ends and, like the E. coli enzyme, were degraded by FtsH. Although LpxC proteins are highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, there are striking differences in their C termini. The Aquifex aeolicus enzyme, which is devoid of the C-terminal extension, was stable in E. coli, whereas LpxC from the alphaproteobacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhodobacter capsulatus was degraded by the Lon protease. Proteolysis of the A. tumefaciens protein required the C-terminal end of LpxC. High stability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LpxC in E. coli and P. aeruginosa suggested that Pseudomonas uses a proteolysis-independent strategy to control its LPS content. The differences in LpxC turnover along with previously reported differences in susceptibility against antimicrobial compounds have important implications for the potential of LpxC as a drug target.
TI  - Extreme antimicrobial peptide and polymyxin B resistance in the genus Burkholderia.
AB  - Cationic antimicrobial peptides and polymyxins are a group of naturally occurring antibiotics that can also possess immunomodulatory activities. They are considered a new source of antibiotics for treating infections by bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Members of the genus Burkholderia, which includes various human pathogens, are inherently resistant to antimicrobial peptides. The resistance is several orders of magnitude higher than that of other Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This review summarizes our current understanding of antimicrobial peptide and polymyxin B resistance in the genus Burkholderia. These bacteria possess major and minor resistance mechanisms that will be described in detail. Recent studies have revealed that many other emerging Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens may also be inherently resistant to antimicrobial peptides and polymyxins and we propose that Burkholderia sp. are a model system to investigate the molecular basis of the resistance in extremely resistant bacteria. Understanding resistance in these types of bacteria will be important if antimicrobial peptides come to be used regularly for the treatment of infections by susceptible bacteria because this may lead to increased resistance in the species that are currently susceptible and may also open up new niches for opportunistic pathogens with high inherent resistance.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of 4(5)-aryl-2-amino-1H-imidazoles, N1-substituted 2-aminoimidazoles and imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts as inhibitors of biofilm formation by Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A library of 112 4(5)-aryl-2-amino-1H-imidazoles, 4,5-diphenyl-2-amino-1H-imidazoles, and N1-substituted 4(5)-phenyl-2-aminoimidazoles was synthesized and tested for the antagonistic effect against biofilm formation by Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The substitution pattern of the 4(5)-phenyl group and the nature of the N1-substituent were found to have a major effect on the biofilm inhibitory activity. The most active compounds of this series were shown to inhibit the biofilm formation at low micromolar concentrations. Furthermore, the influence of 6 imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines and 18 imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts on the biofilm formation was tested. These compounds are the chemical precursors of the 2-aminoimidazoles in our synthesis pathway. A good correlation was found between the activity of the imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts and their corresponding 2-aminoimidazoles, supporting the hypothesis that the imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts are possibly cleaved by cellular nucleophiles to form the active 2-aminoimidazoles. However, the imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines did not show any biofilm inhibitory activity, indicating that these molecules are not susceptible to in situ degradation to 2-aminoimidazoles. Finally, we demonstrated the lack of biofilm inhibitory activity of an array of 37 2N-substituted 2-aminopyrimidines, which are the chemical precursors of the imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidinium salts in our synthesis pathway.
TI  - Transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involve Hfq regulation and reveal a role for oxygen.
AB  - Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.
TI  - Differential requirement for Caspase-1 autoproteolysis in pathogen-induced cell death and cytokine processing.
AB  - Activation of the cysteine protease Caspase-1 is a key event in the innate immune response to infections. Synthesized as a proprotein, Caspase-1 undergoes autoproteolysis within multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. Activated Caspase-1 is required for proteolytic processing and for release of the cytokines interleukin-1beta and interleukin-18, and it can also cause rapid macrophage cell death. We show that macrophage cell death and cytokine maturation in response to infection with diverse bacterial pathogens can be separated genetically and that two distinct inflammasome complexes mediate these events. Inflammasomes containing the signaling adaptor Asc form a single large "focus" in which Caspase-1 undergoes autoproteolysis and processes IL-1beta/IL-18. In contrast, Asc-independent inflammasomes activate Caspase-1 without autoproteolysis and do not form any large structures in the cytosol. Caspase-1 mutants unable to undergo autoproteolysis promoted rapid cell death, but processed IL-1beta/18 inefficiently. Our results suggest the formation of spatially and functionally distinct inflammasomes complexes in response to bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Molecular basis of bacterial defense against host lysozymes: X-ray structures of  periplasmic lysozyme inhibitors PliI and PliC.
AB  - Lysozymes play a key role in the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates by hydrolyzing peptidoglycan, a vital component of the bacterial cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria produce various types of lysozyme inhibitors that allow them to survive the bactericidal action of lysozyme when their outer membrane is permeabilized. So far, three lysozyme inhibitor families have been described: the Ivy (inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme) family, the MliC/PliC (membrane-associated/periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of C-type lysozyme) family, and the PliI (periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of I-type lysozyme) family. Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of Salmonella typhimurium PliC (PliC-St) and Aeromonas hydrophila PliI (PliI-Ah). The structure of PliI-Ah is the first in the recently discovered PliI family of lysozyme inhibitors, while the structure of PliC-St is the first structure of a periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor from the PliC/MliC family. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we demonstrate that both PliC-St and PliI-Ah form stable dimers in solution. The functional dimer architecture of PliC-St is very different from that of the recently described MliC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MliC-Pa), despite the close resemblance of their monomers. Furthermore, PliI-Ah has distinctly different monomer and dimer folds compared to PliC, MliC, and Ivy proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that the inhibitory action of PliI-Ah proceeds via an insertion of a loop containing the conserved SGxY motif into the active center of I-type lysozymes. This motif is related to the functional SGxxY motif found in the MliC/PliC family.
TI  - Vi-CRM 197 as a new conjugate vaccine against Salmonella Typhi.
AB  - An efficacious, low cost vaccine against typhoid fever, especially for young children, would make a major impact on disease burden in developing countries. The virulence capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella Typhi (Vi) coupled to recombinant mutant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein A (Vi-rEPA) has been shown to be highly efficacious. We investigated the use of carrier proteins included in infant vaccines, standardized the conjugation process and developed key assays required for routine lot release at production scale. Vi from a BSL1 organism, Citrobacter freundii, strain WR7011, was used as an alternative to Vi from S. Typhi. We showed that Vi conjugated to CRM(197), a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin, widely used in commercial vaccines, was produced at high yield. Vi-CRM(197) proved immunogenic in animal studies, even without adjuvant. Thus, Vi-CRM(197) appears to be a suitable candidate for the development of a commercially viable, effective typhoid vaccine for developing countries.
TI  - Use of inverse PCR for analysis of class 1 integrons carrying an unusual 3' conserved segment structure.
AB  - By using inverse PCR and DNA sequencing, 13 sul3-associated mutational integrons, 2 defective class 1 integrons, and 1 qnrB2-associated complex sul1-type class 1 integrons were identified in Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae, respectively. In addition, conjugation and Southern hybridization demonstrated that unusual class 1 integrons were located on plasmids or integrated into chromosomal DNA. Thus, an inverse PCR assay can be a valuable tool for the analysis of unusual structures of the 3' conserved region of class 1 integrons.
TI  - Comparison of microbial diversity of edible flowers and basil grown with organic  versus conventional methods.
AB  - The consumption and use of edible flowers as food is growing; however, no study has been conducted to evaluate their role in the cause of food-borne illness or in food safety. Recent food-borne outbreaks traced to fresh herbs have raised concern about their processing and handling. Basil, one of the most commonly used fresh herbs, has been identified as a source of food-borne illness. Baseline assessments of microflora were performed, and the microbial diversity between growing methods (organic vs. conventional) was compared. DNA sequencing was used to identify the microbial flora present on fresh edible flower and basil samples. The most predominant species identified were Enterobacter hormaechei (10%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10%), Enterobacter ludwigii (10%), Enterobacter asburiae (6%), and Enterobacter cowanii (6%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), Salmonella enterica (6%), and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (2%) were also isolated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most species of isolated bacteria belonged to the phyla Gammaproteobacteria (81.2%) and Firmicutes (18.8%). Statistical analysis, diversity index for species richness, and lineage-per-time plots showed that for basil, organically grown samples had a higher microbial diversity than conventionally grown samples. Edible flowers and basil are often grown using organic methods and are commonly consumed raw without any washing or cooking, to preserve aesthetic value, but these practices may pose a potential risk for food-borne illness. The baseline assessment, together with phylogenetic and statistical analyses, indicated possible microbial contamination in edible flowers and basil. The use of statistical estimation of molecular diversity based on the 16S rRNA sequences and lineage-per-time plots with phylogenetic analysis well served as a means for comparing microbial diversity in food samples between the growing methods (organic vs. conventional).
TI  - High-throughput characterization of lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins using mass spectrometry.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding proteins interact with LPS in human serum and mediate various immune responses. We describe a high-throughput LPS-binding protein profiling platform for discovering unknown LPS-binding proteins and potential inflammatory mediators. As a pull-down method, the LPS molecules were immobilized onto epoxy beads and then directly incubated with human serum to screen LPS-binding proteins. Through the "untargeted" mass spectrometric approach, potential LPS-binding proteins which elicit various immune responses in human serum were identified by a highly sensitive LTQ Orbitrap Hybrid Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap FT MS). Therefore, this mass spectrometry (MS)-based profiling method is straightforward for screening unknown LPS-binding proteins and provides physiologically relevant binding partners in human serum.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Type VI secretion regulation: crosstalk and intracellular communication.
AB  - Pathogens use type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to transport proteins into the environment or host cells in response to external stimuli. T6SSs are tightly regulated together with other virulence determinants such as type III secretion systems, quorum sensing (QS), and flagella synthesis. Five pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Edwardsiella tarda, Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are examined for crosstalk proteins (global regulators) that connect T6SSs to other virulence determinants. Common transcriptional regulators (TRs) include two component systems (i.e. PhoPQ), sigma(54) and sigma(54)-dependent TRs (i.e. VasH), and QS regulators. Greater understanding of this integral communication network will define what is essential for bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Fast detection of volatile organic compounds from bacterial cultures by secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry.
AB  - We propose a novel application of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) as a real-time clinical diagnostic tool for bacterial infection. It is known that volatile organic compounds (VOCs), produced in different combinations and quantities by bacteria as metabolites, generate characteristic odors for certain bacteria. These VOCs comprise a specific metabolic profile that can be used for species or serovar identification, but rapid and sensitive analytical methods are required for broad utility. In this study, the VOC profiles of five bacterial groups from four genera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Salmonella enterica serovar Pullorum, were characterized by SESI-MS. Thirteen compounds were identified from these bacterial cultures, and the combination of these VOCs creates a unique pattern for each genus. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for the purpose of species or serovar discrimination. The first three principal components exhibit a clear separation between the metabolic volatile profiles of these five bacterial groups that is independent of the growth medium. As a first step toward addressing the complexity of clinical application, in vitro tests for mixed cultures were conducted. The results show that individual species or serovars in a mixed culture are identifiable among a biological VOC background, and the ratios of the detected volatiles reflect the proportion of each bacterium in the mixture. Our data confirm the utility of SESI-MS in real-time identification of bacterial species or serovars in vitro, which, in the future, may play a promising clinical role in diagnosing infections.
TI  - Sensitization of microcin J25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  - Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by Escherichia coli. MccJ25 inhibits RNA polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. MccJ25 uptake into E. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor FhuA and the inner membrane proteins TonB, ExbB, ExbD, and SbmA. This peptide is active on some E. coli, Salmonella, and Shigella species strains, while other Gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, are completely resistant. In the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (KFF)(3)K made some resistant strains sensitive to MccJ25, among them S. Typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. The results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (KFF)(3)K allows MccJ25 penetration in an FhuA and SbmA-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic Salmonella strains.
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - A report from the 20th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious  Diseases (April 10-13, 2010 - Vienna, Austria).
AB  - Effective antimicrobials currently in use in Europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. Multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID). As extensively discussed in an oral session entitled Worldwide Dissemination of Resistances by 10 specialists from across Europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (Roede, B.M. et al., Abst O127; Huenger, F. et al., Abst O395; Mera, R.M. et al., Abst O483). While many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (Derde, L. et al., Abst O464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the Austria Center in Vienna. The war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. Treatments of the diseases caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by new research and population surveys. However, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in Vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central Argentina--isolation of an active principle from Achyrocline satureioides.
AB  - The great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. Extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central Argentina were therefore evaluated for their IN VITRO inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. The susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Extracts from Achyrocline satureioides, Flourensia oolepis, Lepechinia floribunda, and Lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/mL, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity-guided isolation of A. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-O-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. This compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the MIC and MBC were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/mL, respectively. The strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from A. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.
TI  - Susceptibility of complete bacteria and spheroplasts of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi to rolliniastatin-2.
AB  - Rolliniastatin-2 is an acetogenin with elevated cytotoxic activity whose effect on bacteria has not yet been analysed and was isolated by CC from the hexanic extract of Annona diversifolia Saff (Annonaceae) seeds. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi as well as spheroplasts of these bacteria to the compound, determining percent inhibition by turbidimetry. The complete bacteria were susceptible to rolliniastatin-2 (28-40% at 2 mg mL(-1)), while spheroplasts showed an increased susceptibility (55-58%, at 1 ng mL(-1)). The most susceptible bacterium was P. aeruginosa, while the spheroplasts of E. coli and S. typhi were most sensitive to the compound's effects.
TI  - The cyclotide cycloviolacin O2 from Viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. METHODS: Prototypic cyclotides, including the Mobius kalata B1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin O2 (cyO2), were isolated using reversed-phase HPLC. Initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (RDAs) and MIC assays with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as test strains. For the most active peptide, cyO2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species. Charged residues in cyO2 were chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. RESULTS: CyO2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 and E. coli in RDAs and MIC assays, while the other peptides were less active. In time-kill assays, cyO2 also had bactericidal activity against the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against S. aureus. Chemical masking of the charged Glu and Lys residues in cyO2 caused a near total loss of activity against Salmonella, while masking Arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. CONCLUSIONS: CyO2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The charged residues in cyO2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. In combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyO2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of prunin, a citric flavanone glucoside, and its prunin  6''-O-lauroyl ester.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the antimicrobial potential of prunin (P), a flavanone glucoside resulting from the hydrolysis of naringin present in grapefruit, and of its prunin 6''-O-lauroyl ester (PL), synthesized by enzymatic catalysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: P and its lauroyl ester were tested against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds. P showed no inhibitory effect against the micro-organisms assayed, but stimulated growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and different Bacilllus sp. However, 150 mug ml(-1) of PL inhibited Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, many Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Enterococcus avium DSMZ17511, and different Listeria monocytogenes strains. In the last case, L. monocytogenes, sensitive or bacteriocin-resistant cells, lost nearly 4-log reductions after 30 min of contact. A bactericidal mode of action was determined using both scanning and transmission electronic microscopies. CONCLUSIONS: PL could be used as a food additive, because at low concentration (150 mug ml(-1)) it exhibited antimicrobial activity against important food-borne pathogens. A bactericidal effect was also determined on L. monocytogenes sensitive and bacteriocin-resistant mutant strains. P did not show any antimicrobial property at all. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PL is a potential antimicrobial compound with a high anti-Listeria property.
TI  - Synthesis and Antimicrobial Activity of N,N'-Bis(2-hydroxylbenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine Derivatives.
AB  - A series of N,N'-Bis(2-hydroxylbenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine derivatives and its schiff bases were synthesized, characterized and screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica. Result indicated that the ethylenediamine derivatives, N,N'-Bis(2-hydroxy-5-bromobenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (21), and N,N'-Bis(2-hydroxy-5-chlorobenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (22) showed the most favorable antimicrobial activity exhibiting LC(50) of 11.6 and 8.79 muM against S.enterica, 86 and 138 muM against P. aeruginosa, and 140 and 287 muM against S. aureus, respectively. These compounds displayed highest level of resistance with S. aureus. Thus, the high level of activity seen with the compounds (21, 22) suggests that these compounds could serve as the leads for development of novel synthetic compounds with enhanced antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Specific and rapid enumeration of viable but nonculturable and viable-culturable  gram-negative bacteria by using flow cytometry.
AB  - An issue of critical concern in microbiology is the ability to detect viable but  nonculturable (VBNC) and viable-culturable (VC) cells by methods other than existing approaches. Culture methods are selective and underestimate the real population, and other options (direct viable count and the double-staining method using epifluorescence microscopy and inhibitory substance-influenced molecular methods) are also biased and time-consuming. A rapid approach that reduces selectivity, decreases bias from sample storage and incubation, and reduces assay time is needed. Flow cytometry is a sensitive analytical technique that can rapidly monitor physiological states of bacteria. This report outlines a method to optimize staining protocols and the flow cytometer (FCM) instrument settings for the enumeration of VBNC and VC bacterial cells within 70 min. Experiments were performed using the FCM to quantify VBNC and VC Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cells after staining with different fluorescent probes: SYTO 9, SYTO 13, SYTO 17, SYTO 40, and propidium iodide (PI). The FCM data were compared with those for specific standard nutrient agar to enumerate the number of cells in different states. By comparing results from cultures at late log phase, 1 to 64% of cells were nonculturable, 40 to 98% were culturable, and 0.7 to 4.5% had damaged cell membranes and were therefore theoretically dead. Data obtained using four different gram-negative bacteria exposed to heat and stained with PI also illustrate the usefulness of the approach for the rapid and unbiased detection of dead versus live organisms.
TI  - Asymmetrical distribution of the second messenger c-di-GMP upon bacterial cell division.
AB  - The bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) regulates cellular motility and the synthesis of organelles and molecules that promote adhesion to a variety of biological and nonbiological surfaces. These properties likely require tight spatial and temporal regulation of c-di-GMP concentration. We have developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors to monitor c-di-GMP concentrations within single bacterial cells by microscopy. Fluctuations of c-di-GMP were visualized in diverse Gram-negative bacterial species and observed to be cell cycle dependent. Asymmetrical distribution of c-di-GMP in the progeny correlated with the time of cell division and polarization for Caulobacter crescentus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, asymmetrical distribution of c-di-GMP was observed as part of cell division, which may indicate an important regulatory step in extracellular organelle biosynthesis or function.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of polyphenols extracted from almond skins.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from natural and blanched almond skins, the latter being a by-product from the almond processing industry. METHODS AND RESULTS: Almond skin extracts were tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus durans) and the yeast Candida albicans. Almond skin fractions were found to have antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes and Staph. aureus in the range 250-500 microg ml(-1), natural skins showing antimicrobial potential against the Gram-negative Salm. enterica. The interactions between three almond skin flavonoids were also evaluated with isobolograms. CONCLUSIONS: Pairwise combinations of protocatechuic acid, naringenin and epicatechin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions against Salm. enterica and Staph. aureus. Antagonism was observed against L. monocytogenes with all combinations tested. Further studies need to be performed to understand the mechanisms responsible for these interactions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Almond skins are a potential source of natural antimicrobials.
TI  - Identifying essential genes in bacterial metabolic networks with machine learning methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying essential genes in bacteria supports to identify potential drug targets and an understanding of minimal requirements for a synthetic cell. However, experimentally assaying the essentiality of their coding genes is resource intensive and not feasible for all bacterial organisms, in particular if they are infective. RESULTS: We developed a machine learning technique to identify essential genes using the experimental data of genome-wide knock-out screens from one bacterial organism to infer essential genes of another related bacterial organism. We used a broad variety of topological features, sequence characteristics and co-expression properties potentially associated with essentiality, such as flux deviations, centrality, codon frequencies of the sequences, co-regulation and phyletic retention. An organism-wise cross-validation on bacterial species yielded reliable results with good accuracies (area under the receiver-operator-curve of 75% - 81%). Finally, it was applied to drug target predictions for Salmonella typhimurium. We compared our predictions to the viability of experimental knock-outs of S. typhimurium and identified 35 enzymes, which are highly relevant to be considered as potential drug targets. Specifically, we detected promising drug targets in the non-mevalonate pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Using elaborated features characterizing network topology, sequence information and microarray data enables to predict essential genes from a bacterial reference organism to a related query organism without any knowledge about the essentiality of genes of the query organism. In general, such a method is beneficial for inferring drug targets when experimental data about genome-wide knockout screens is not available for the investigated organism.
TI  - The biofilm architecture of sixty opportunistic pathogens deciphered using a high throughput CLSM method.
AB  - This study proposes a high throughput method based on Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) combined with the use of 96-wells microtiter plates compatible with high resolution imaging for the study of biofilm formation and structure. As an illustration, the three-dimensional structures of biofilms formed by 60 opportunistic pathogens were thus observed and quantified. The results revealed the diversity of biofilm architectures. Specific spatial arrangement such as the mushroom-like structures already described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed. Other features, such as hollow voids in microcolonies of Salmonella enterica strain Agona, were identified for the first time. The combined use of microplates and confocal imaging proved to be a good alternative to the other high throughput methods commonly used as it enables the direct, insitu, qualitative and quantitative characterization of biofilm architecture. This high content method should lead to a clearer understanding of the structure-function relationships implicated in biofilms traits.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy using a highly pure chlorin e6.
AB  - The aim of the present study is to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a highly pure chlorin e(6) (Ce(6)), against various pathogenic bacteria. To examine the antimicrobial effect of Ce(6)-mediated PDT against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, inhibition zone formation, CFU quantification, and bacterial viability were evaluated. Inhibition zone analysis showed that Ce(6)-mediated PDT is very effective to inhibit the growth of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, but has only minor effect to E. coli and S. Typhimurium, which was dependent on the energy density of laser and dose of Ce(6). Ce(6)-mediated PDT also nearly inhibited the colony formation of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, and partially inhibited that of E. coli and S. Typhimurium. In addition, the number of viable bacteria decreased greatly after PDT application with LS-chlorin e6 of 10 microM and laser and energy density of 20 J/cm(2). These results show that Ce(6)-mediated PDT can be an effective alternative for antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the bioactive compound beauvericin produced by Fusarium proliferatum on solid medium of wheat.
AB  - To obtain the bioactive compound beauvericin (BEA), Fusarium proliferatum CECT 20569 was grown on a solid medium of wheat, utilizing the technique of the solid state fermentation (SSF), being this mycotoxin purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse phase semi-preparative column using as the mobile phase acetonitrile/water in gradient condition. The purity of the BEA was verified by analytical HPLC and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The pure fractions of BEA were utilized to determinate the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract as: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3J6.
AB  - Biofilm formation results in medical threats or economic losses and is therefore  a major concern in a variety of domains. In two-species biofilms of marine bacteria grown under dynamic conditions, Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3J6 formed mixed biofilms with Bacillus sp. strain 4J6 but was largely predominant over Paracoccus sp. strain 4M6 and Vibrio sp. strain D01. The supernatant of Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 liquid culture (SN(3J6)) was devoid of antibacterial activity against free-living Paracoccus sp. 4M6 and Vibrio sp. D01 cells, but it impaired their ability to grow as single-species biofilms and led to higher percentages of nonviable cells in 48-h biofilms. Antibiofilm molecules of SN(3J6) were able to coat the glass surfaces used to grow biofilms and reduced bacterial attachment about 2-fold, which might partly explain the biofilm formation defect but not the loss of cell viability. SN(3J6) had a wide spectrum of activity since it affected all Gram-negative marine strains tested except other Pseudoalteromonas strains. Biofilm biovolumes of the sensitive strains were reduced 3- to 530-fold, and the percentages of nonviable cells were increased 3- to 225-fold. Interestingly, SN(3J6) also impaired biofilm formation by three strains belonging to the human-pathogenic species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli. Such an antibiofilm activity is original and opens up a variety of applications for Pseudoalteromonas sp. 3J6 and/or its active exoproducts in biofilm prevention strategies.
TI  - [Construction of a promoter reporter array for antibiotic screening].
AB  - We designed and constructed an antibiotic screening system by using antibiotic responsive genes as reporters. Plasmid pCS26 carrying a promoterless luminescence reporter, luxCDABE, was used as the vector and the promoter regions of antibiotic responsive genes/operons from Escherichia coli were cloned upstream of the lux reporter to form the first part of the screening reporter array. Random promoter library of Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were screened for antibiotic responsive clones which consist of the second part of the screening array. The selected final reporter array responded to different antibiotics in distinct patterns and enabled in vivo high-throughput screening for antibiotics. Unknown antibiotics could, in general, be classified by analyzing the response patterns. This screening system is both sensitive and efficient and should prove to be a useful tool for screening new antibiotic compounds.
TI  - Peptidomic analysis of the skin secretions of the frog Pachymedusa dacnicolor.
AB  - High-resolution mass spectrometry-based peptidomics has been used to characterize several components in electro-stimulated skin secretions of the endemic Mexican frog Pachymedusa dacnicolor. Peptide mass screening performed in an Orbitrap-XL mass spectrometer showed that P. dacnicolor skin secretions possess 194 different components with molecular masses ranging mainly from 500 to 6,000 Da. Dozens of molecules were partially sequenced including two novel protease inhibitors. Additionally, one posttranslationally modified bradykinin and two novel dermaseptin-like antimicrobial peptides were fully sequenced. The novel peptide named here DMS-DA5 was fully characterized and showed potent antibacterial activity against various bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with minimal inhibitory concentrations from 3.10 to 25.0 microM.
TI  - Natural and synthetic compounds such as trimethoprim behave as inhibitors of efflux in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that small heterocyclic or nitrogen-containing compounds could act as RND efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs). To ascertain possible EPIs, we sought to identify compounds that synergized with substrates of RND efflux pumps for wild-type bacteria and those that overexpress an efflux pump, but had no synergistic activity against strains in which a gene encoding a component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump had been inactivated. METHODS: Twenty-six compounds plus L-phenylalanyl-L-arginyl-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were screened by bioassay to identify compounds that synergized with ciprofloxacin for a range of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The MICs of ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin and ethidium bromide+/-synergizing compounds were determined, and the ability to inhibit the efflux of Hoechst 33342 was measured. RESULTS: Two compounds, trimethoprim and epinephrine, consistently showed synergy with antibiotics for most strains. The combinations did not show synergy for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in which the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump was inactive. Both compounds inhibited the efflux of Hoechst 33342. CONCLUSIONS: Two compounds, trimethoprim and epinephrine, which are already licensed for use in man, may warrant further analysis as EPIs. The combination of trimethoprim with another antibiotic is a well-used combination in anti-infective chemotherapy, and so combination with another agent, such as a quinolone, may be a viable option and further studies are now required.
TI  - The role of potassium in inflammasome activation by bacteria.
AB  - Many Gram-negative bacteria possess a type III secretion system (TTSS( paragraph  sign)) that can activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, process caspase-1 and lead to secretion of mature IL-1beta. This is dependent on the presence of intracellular flagellin. Previous reports have suggested that this activation is independent of extracellular K(+) and not accompanied by leakage of K(+) from the cell, in contrast to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, non-flagellated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to activate NLRC4, suggesting that formation of a pore in the cell membrane by the TTSS apparatus may be sufficient for inflammasome activation. Thus, we set out to determine if extracellular K(+) influenced P. aeruginosa inflammasome activation. We found that raising extracellular K(+) prevented TTSS NLRC4 activation by the non-flagellated P. aeruginosa strain PA103DeltaUDeltaT at concentrations above 90 mm, higher than those reported to inhibit NLRP3 activation. Infection was accompanied by efflux of K(+) from a minority of cells as determined using the K(+)-sensitive fluorophore PBFI, but no formation of a leaky pore. We obtained exactly the same results following infection with Salmonella typhimurium, previously described as independent of extracellular K(+). The inhibitory effect of raised extracellular K(+) on NLRC4 activation thus reflects a requirement for a decrease in intracellular K(+) for this inflammasome component as well as that described for NLRP3.
TI  - Inhibitory mechanism of novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Bacterial UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) catalyzes the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolphyruvate (PEP) to uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG), which is the first step of bacterial cell wall synthesis. We identified thimerosal, thiram, and ebselen as effective inhibitors of Heamophilus influenzae MurA by screening a chemical library that consisted of a wide range of bioactive compounds. When MurA was preincubated with these inhibitors, their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were found to range from 0.1 to 0.7 microM. In particular, thimerosal suppressed the growth of several different Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium at a concentration range of 1-2 microg/ml. These inhibitors covalently modified the cysteine residue near the active site of MurA. This modification changed the open conformation of MurA to a more closed configuration, which may have prevented the necessary conformational change from occurring during the enzyme reaction.
TI  - Investigation of a community outbreak of typhoid fever associated with drinking water.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This report is about the investigation of an outbreak of typhoid fever claimed three human lives and left more than 300 people suffered within one week. The aim of this report is to draw the attention of global health community towards the areas that are still far from basic human essentialities. METHODS: A total of 250 suspected cases of typhoid fever were interviewed, out of which 100 were selected for sample collection on the basis of criteria included temperature > 38 degrees C since the onset of outbreak, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting and weakness. Food and water samples were also collected and analyzed microbiologically. RESULTS: Inhabitants of village lived in poor and unhygienic conditions with no proper water supply or sewage disposal facilities and other basic necessities of life. They consumed water from a nearby well which was the only available source of drinking water. Epidemiological evidences revealed the gross contamination of well with dead and decaying animal bodies, their fecal material and garbage. Microbiological analysis of household and well water samples revealed the presence of heavy bacterial load with an average total aerobic count 106-109 CFU/ml. A number of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Bacillus species, Staphylococcus species, Enterobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Lab investigations confirmed the presence of multidrug resistant strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in 100% well water, 65% household water samples and 2% food items. 22% of clinical stool samples were tested positive with Salmonella enterica serover Typhi CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated the possible involvement of well water in outbreaks. In order to avoid such outbreaks in future, we contacted the local health authorities and urged them to immediately make arrangements for safe drinking water supply.
TI  - Resistance development profiling of piperacillin in combination with the novel {beta}-lactamase inhibitor BLI-489.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate development of resistance to the piperacillin/BLI-489 combination. METHODS: BLI-489 was used at a constant concentration of 4 mg/L. Spontaneous mutation frequency was measured on piperacillin/BLI-489-containing agar plates. Five beta-lactamase-producing strains were exposed to a serial dilution of piperacillin/BLI-489, and the highest concentration allowing growth was used to inoculate subsequent serial passage for 10 days. Mutation stability was monitored in drug-free medium for 10 days. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (OXA-3, OXA-7, ACT-1, SHV-1 or none), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (CTX-M-5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (SHV-1 and SHV-5) and Enterobacter cloacae (AmpC) had a spontaneous mutation frequency of < or =1.0 x 10(-9). Two AmpC-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains had a mutation frequency of 6.52 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-7); a beta-lactamase-negative P. aeruginosa strain had a mutation frequency of 2.68 x 10(-8). The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) was < or =32 mg/L. During serial passages, the MIC increased 64- and 128-fold for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (CTX-M-5) and E. cloacae (AmpC), respectively, to > or =512 mg/L. The MIC reverted to < or =64 mg/L after serial passages in drug-free medium. The MICs increased only 4-fold for K. pneumoniae (SHV-1 and SHV-5), E. coli (OXA-3) and E. coli (SHV-1). CONCLUSIONS: Piperacillin/BLI-489 demonstrated a low probability of spontaneous resistance development in vitro for all of the strains tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The MPC value for all strains was < or =32 mg/L. Resistance developed during serial passage for two of the five strains tested; however, this resistance phenotype was unstable as MIC values reverted to < or =64 mg/L after propagation in drug-free medium.
TI  - Improving the AOAC use-dilution method by establishing a minimum log density value for test microbes on inoculated carriers.
AB  - The AOAC Use-Dilution methods, 955.14 (Salmonella enterica), 955.15 (Staphylococcus aureus), and 964.02 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), are used to measure the efficacy of disinfectants on hard inanimate surfaces. The methods do not provide procedures to assess log density of the test microbe on inoculated penicylinders (carrier counts). Without a method to measure and monitor carrier counts, the associated efficacy data may not be reliable and repeatable. This report provides a standardized procedure to address this method deficiency. Based on carrier count data collected by four laboratories over an 8 year period, a minimum log density value is proposed to qualify the test results. Carrier count data were collected concurrently with 242 Use-Dilution tests. The tests were conducted on products bearing claims against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus with and without an organic soil load (OSL) added to the inoculum (as specified on the product label claim). Six carriers were assayed per test for a total of 1452 carriers. All 242 mean log densities were at least 6.0 (geometric mean of 1.0 x 10(6) CFU/carrier). The mean log densities did not exceed 7.5 (geometric mean of 3.2 x 10(7) CFU/carrier). For all microbes and OSL treatments, the mean log density (+/- SEM) was 6.7 (+/- 0.07) per carrier (a geometric mean of 5.39 x 10(6) CFU/carrier). The mean log density for six carriers per test showed good repeatability (0.29) and reproducibility (0.32). A minimum mean log density of 6.0 is proposed as a validity requirement for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The minimum level provides for the potential inherent variability that may be experienced by a wide range of laboratories and the slight effect due to the addition of an OSL. A follow-up report is planned to present data to support the carrier count procedure and carrier counts for S. enterica.
TI  - Physical and chemical characterization and immunologic properties of Salmonella enterica serovar typhi capsular polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugates.
AB  - Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem in developing countries, especially among young children. Recent studies showed more than 50% of typhoid cases are in children under 5 years old. Licensed vaccines, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi capsular Vi, did not confer protection against typhoid fever for this age group. Vi conjugate, prepared by binding Vi to Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exoprotein A (rEPA), induces protective levels of antibody at as young as 2 years old. Because of the lack of regulatory precedent for rEPA in licensing vaccines, we employed diphtheria toxoid (DT) as the carrier protein to accommodate accessibility in developing countries. Five lots of Vi-DT conjugates were prepared using adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) as the linker. All 5 lots showed consistency in their physical and chemical characteristics and final yields. These Vi-DT conjugates elicited levels of IgG anti-Vi in young mice significantly higher than those in mice injected with Vi alone and induced a booster response upon reinjection. This booster effect was absent if the Vi replaced one of the two conjugate injections. Vi-DT was stable under repeated freeze-thaw (20 cycles). We plan to perform clinical evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of Vi-DT when added to the infant combination vaccines.
TI  - Inhibition of fungi and gram-negative bacteria by bacteriocin BacTN635 produced by Lactobacillus plantarum sp. TN635.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate 54 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains isolated from meat, fermented vegetables and dairy products for their capacity to produce antimicrobial activities against several bacteria and fungi. The strain designed TN635 has been selected for advanced studies. The supernatant culture of this strain inhibits the growth of all tested pathogenic including the four Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enterica ATCC43972, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189, Hafnia sp. and Serratia sp.) and the pathogenic fungus Candida tropicalis R2 CIP203. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the strain TN635 (1,540 pb accession no FN252881) and the phylogenetic analysis, we propose the assignment of our new isolate bacterium as Lactobacillus plantarum sp. TN635 strain. Its antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. Highest antimicrobial activity was found between pH 3 and 11 with an optimum at pH = 7. The BacTN635 was purified to homogeneity by a four-step protocol involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, centrifugal microconcentrators with a 10-kDa membrane cutoff, gel filtration Sephadex G-25, and C18 reverse-phase HPLC. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified BacTN635, revealed a single band with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 4 kDa. The maximum bacteriocin production (5,000 AU/ml) was recorded after a 16-h incubation in Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) medium at 30 degrees C. The mode of action of the partial purified BacTN635 was identified as bactericidal against Listeria ivanovii BUG 496 and as fungistatic against C. tropicalis R2 CIP203.
TI  - Integration of microfiltration and anion-exchange nanoparticles-based magnetic separation with MALDI mass spectrometry for bacterial analysis.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is powerful in characterizing and identifying bacterial isolates. However, sufficient quantities of bacterial cells are required for generating MALDI mass spectra and a procedure to isolate and enrich target bacteria from sample matrix prior to MALDI-MS analysis is often necessary. In this paper, anion-exchange superparamagnetic nanoparticles (NPs), i.e., fluidMAG-DEAE and fluidMAG-Q, were employed to capture Aeromonas, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Bacillus, Staphylococcus and Escherichia coli from aqueous solutions and fresh water. The magnetically isolated bacteria were then characterized by whole cell MALDI-MS. The capture efficiency was found to be dependent on bacterial species, medium pH, the functional group and concentration of the NPs. The experimental results demonstrated that fluidMAG-DEAE and fluidMAG-Q were broad spectrum probes for bacteria. Furthermore, both dead and live bacteria could be captured by the NPs, and the live bacteria captured remained viable. Membrane filtration prior to the magnetic isolation could increase enrichment factor and eliminate potential matrix interference. A detection limit of 1 x 10(3)cfu/ml was achieved for the bacteria spiked in tap water and reservoir water, and the analytical time was around 2h.
TI  - From small reads do mighty genomes grow.
AB  - This month's Genome Watch discusses the use of next-generation sequencing technologies to assemble draft genomes for two pseudomonad species.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis uncovers 3 novel loci encoding type six secretion systems differentially distributed in Salmonella serotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recently described Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) represents a new paradigm of protein secretion in bacteria. A number of bioinformatic studies have been conducted to identify T6SS gene clusters in the available bacterial genome sequences. According to these studies, Salmonella harbors a unique T6SS encoded in the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 6 (SPI-6). Since these studies only considered few Salmonella genomes, the present work aimed to identify novel T6SS loci by in silico analysis of every genome sequence of Salmonella available. RESULTS: The analysis of sequencing data from 44 completed or in progress Salmonella genome projects allowed the identification of 3 novel T6SS loci. These clusters are located in differentially-distributed genomic islands we designated SPI-19, SPI-20 and SPI-21, respectively. SPI-19 was identified in a subset of S. enterica serotypes including Dublin, Weltevreden, Agona, Gallinarum and Enteritidis. In the later, an internal deletion eliminated most of the island. On the other hand, SPI-20 and SPI-21 were restricted to S. enterica subspecies arizonae (IIIa) serotype 62:z4,z23:-. Remarkably, SPI-21 encodes a VgrG protein containing a C-terminal extension similar to S-type pyocins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This is not only the first evolved VgrG described in Salmonella, but also the first evolved VgrG including a pyocin domain described so far in the literature. In addition, the data indicate that SPI-6 T6SS is widely distributed in S. enterica and absent in serotypes Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Agona, Javiana, Paratyphi B, Virchow, IIIa 62:z4,z23:- and IIIb 61:1,v:1,5,(7). Interestingly, while some serotypes harbor multiple T6SS (Dublin, Weltvreden and IIIa 62:z4,z23:-) others do not encode for any (Enteritidis, Paratyphi B, Javiana, Virchow and IIIb 61:1,v:1,5,(7)). Comparative and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the 4 T6SS loci in Salmonella have a distinct evolutionary history. Finally, we identified an orphan Hcp-like protein containing the Hcp/COG3157 domain linked to a C-terminal extension. We propose to designate this and related proteins as "evolved Hcps". CONCLUSION: Altogether, our data suggest that (i) the Salmonella T6SS loci were acquired by independent lateral transfer events and (ii) evolved to contribute in the adaptation of the serotypes to different lifestyles and environments, including animal hosts. Notably, the presence of an evolved VgrG protein related to pyocins suggests a novel role for T6SS in bacterial killing. Future studies on the roles of the identified T6SS loci will expand our knowledge on Salmonella pathogenesis and host specificity.
TI  - Quinine is bactericidal.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial properties of Quinine dihydrochloride and its MIC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Quasi-Experimental study was conducted at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi from July 2006 to November 2006. Two hundred samples of pus, blood, sputum and ascitic fluid, from hospitalized adult patients from Medicine ward (W-7) having different Bacterial infections were studied. Proforma was filled to document the demographic details. Samples were collected from different sites, isolated, identified and checked for antimicrobial susceptibility of quinine dihydrochloride by standard methods. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi were inhibited at MIC of 125 g/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes was inhibited at MIC of 31.25 g/ml of quinine dihydrochloride (Dilution ranges from 31.25 g/ml to 1000 g/ml). CONCLUSION: The concomitant antimalarial and antibacterial action of Quinine dihydrochloride may be beneficial in developing countries adding to cost effectiveness of treatment provided to patients belonging to low socioeconomic group.
TI  - [Active efflux as the multidrug resistance mechanism].
AB  - Active efflux is a common resistance mechanism in a wide range of bacterial pathogens. It is responsible for the transport of such toxic compounds as drugs, toxins, and detergents. Pumps with broad substrate profiles promote the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens that are a particular threat to contemporary medicine, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enterica sv Typhimurium. One can distinguish five major class of transport systems on the basis of their structure and function: MFS (major facilitator superfamily), SMR (small multidrug-resistance family), MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family), ABC (ATP binding cassette superfamily), and RND (resistance nodulation cell division family). Substrate transport may include hydrogen proton exchange or energy generated via ATP hydrolysis. The transport is effectively regulated by local regulatory proteins.such as BmrR from Bacillus subtilis, or by the global bacterial regulatory system. Investigations into efflux pumps and their substrate profiles and regulatory mechanisms have led to the discovery of new therapeutics and pump inhibitors that could potentially become alternative and effective antimicrobial drugs. Additionally, some alternative therapies such as photodynamic inactivation could be more effective if the synergistic action of efflux pump inhibitors are used.Thus research into efflux transport systems seems to be an important element of contemporary medicine .
TI  - In vitro evaluation of a new cefixime-clavulanic acid combination for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The study was conducted to evaluate a new cefixime-clavulanic acid combination for in vitro susceptibility towards gram-negative bacteria. A total of 220 isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Acinetobacter spp, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were included in the study. The isolates were tested for susceptibility towards the new combination antimicrobial molecule cefixime with clavulanic acid by disk diffusion and Epsilometer strip (E-strip) Minimum Inhibitary Concentration (MIC) method. Of the 101 E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, 62.4% were found to be extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Almost half of these were from the community and 55.6% were hospital isolates. Of the ESBL isolates, 19% were AmpC (cephalosporinases that are poorly inhibited by beta lactamase inhibitor) producers while the remaining 81% were non AmpC ESBL producers. The AmpC producers were resistant to both cefixime and the combination, while the non-AmpC producers were sensitive to the combination. The addition of clavulanate to cefixime did not improve the sensitivities of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter isolates. There were no ESBL isolates among the S. Typhi isolates, all of which were sensitive to cefixime. Of the S. Typhimurium, 88.9% were ESBL producers and all of these were resistant to cefixime but sensitive to the combination. The combination of cefixime with clavulanic acid offers the advantage of oral administration and appears to be a viable option for the treatment of uncomplicated community acquired infections caused by non-AmpC ESBL producing gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A conserved alpha-helix essential for a type VI secretion-like system of Francisella tularensis.
AB  - Francisella tularensis harbors genes with similarity to genes encoding components of a type VI secretion system (T6SS) recently identified in several gram-negative bacteria. These genes include iglA and iglB encoding IglA and IglB, homologues of which are conserved in most T6SSs. We used a yeast two-hybrid system to study the interaction of the Igl proteins of F. tularensis LVS. We identified a region of IglA, encompassing residues 33 to 132, necessary for efficient binding to IglB, as well as for IglAB protein stability and intramacrophage growth. In particular, residues 103 to 122, overlapping a highly conserved alpha-helix, played an absolutely essential role. Point mutations within this domain caused modest defects in IglA-IglB binding in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae but markedly impaired intramacrophage replication and phagosomal escape, resulting in severe attenuation of LVS in mice. Thus, IglA-IglB complex formation is clearly crucial for Francisella pathogenicity. This interaction may be universal to type VI secretion, since IglAB homologues of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Escherichia coli were also shown to interact in yeast, and the interaction was dependent on preservation of the same alpha-helix. Heterologous interactions between nonnative IglAB proteins further supported the notion of a conserved binding site. Thus, IglA-IglB complex formation is clearly crucial for Francisella pathogenicity, and the same interaction is conserved in other human pathogens.
TI  - Quorum sensing in veterinary pathogens: mechanisms, clinical importance and future perspectives.
AB  - Under certain circumstances the individuals of a bacterial population may find advantages in acting together and making "collective decisions". This phenomenon is better known as quorum sensing. When the concentration of signal molecules produced by the surrounding bacteria exceeds a certain threshold, the bacterial population acts as a single organism, collectively expressing virulence genes, biofilm forming genes, etc. Several mechanisms of quorum sensing are discussed, each with its distinct signal molecules and respective receptors. Some of these mechanisms are restricted to sensing intraspecies signalling, but interspecies and even interkingdom signalling have also been described. Several veterinary pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella Typhimurium use quorum sensing as a means to optimize virulence gene expression and host colonization. Therefore, targeting of the QS mechanisms may provide a novel strategy for combating bacterial infections, also in veterinary medicine.
TI  - Free intracellular Ca2+ regulates bacterial lipopolysaccharide induction of iNOS  in human macrophages.
AB  - Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) reaction is of enormous significance in innate immune protective response of host to microbial challenges. We speculate that microbial challenges, by virtue of their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content, exert an effect on intracellular free Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)]i), which evokes cellular signaling in a manner that depends on LPS type. In this study, we investigated the effect of LPS from heterogeneous sources (Chlamydia pneumoniae [cLPS], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [pLPS], and Salmonella typhimurium [sLPS]) on nitric oxide (NO) release and iNOS expression in THP-1- and U937-derived macrophages, and determined the role of free [Ca(2+)]i on LPS-mediated generation of NO and iNOS expression in these cell types. The role of free [Ca(2+)]i oscillation and the probable input of extracellular Ca(2+) influx on Ca(2+)-signals was monitored in relation to iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages. There was a significant difference in the time course release of NO in both macrophage types when stimulated with cLPS, or pLPS, or sLPS. In all instances, LPS induced a significant release of NO compared with interferon-gamma. There was a difference in the pattern of basal iNOS reaction leading to NO release compared to iNOS expression observed at 24h post-stimulation. While a biphasic pattern was observed in the manner in which free [Ca(2+)]i affected iNOS expression, inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx resulted in a steady increase in iNOS expression. The implications of these findings are: moderate free [Ca(2+)]i affects macrophage release of NO and iNOS expression during LPS stimulation; also, LPS of heterogeneous sources differentially evokes macrophage iNOS reactions irrespective of macrophage types.
TI  - Discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - A number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-Trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. Eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two Gram-positive strains of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with LC(50) of 5.8 muM and 5.6 muM respectively. However, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-negative strains, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-Gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Citrate-mediated iron uptake in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: involvement of the citrate-inducible FecA receptor and the FeoB ferrous iron transporter.
AB  - In an attempt to identify components of a ferric citrate uptake system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a mutant library of a siderophore-deficient strain (IA614) was constructed and screened for defects in citrate-promoted growth in an Fe-restricted medium. A mutant disrupted in gene PA3901, encoding a homologue of the outer-membrane ferric citrate receptor, FecA, of Escherichia coli (FecA(E.c.)), was recovered and shown to be deficient in citrate-promoted growth and citrate-mediated Fe uptake. A mutant disrupted in gene PA4825, encoding a homologue of the MgtA/MgtB Mg2+ transporters in Salmonella enterica, was similarly deficient in citrate-promoted growth, though this was due to a citrate sensitivity of the mutant apparently resulting from citrate-promoted acquisition of Fe2+ and resultant oxidative stress. Consistent with citrate delivering Fe to cells as Fe2+, a P. aeruginosa mutant lacking the FeoB Fe2+ transporter homologue, PA4358, was compromised for citrate-promoted growth in Fe-restricted medium and showed markedly reduced citrate-mediated Fe uptake. Subsequent elimination of two Fe3+ transporter homologues, PA5216 and PA4687, in the feoB mutant failed to further compromise citrate-promoted growth or Fe uptake, though the additional loss of pcoA, encoding a periplasmic ferroxidase implicated in Fe2+ acquisition, completely abrogated citrate-mediated Fe uptake. Fe acquisition mediated by other siderophores (e.g. pyoverdine) was, however, unaffected in the quadruple knockout strain. These data indicate that Fe delivered to P. aeruginosa by citrate is released as Fe2+, probably in the periplasm, prior to its transport into cells via Fe transport components.
TI  - Mononuclear Ru(III) Schiff base complexes: synthesis, spectral, redox, catalytic  and biological activity studies.
AB  - An octahedral ruthenium(III) Schiff base complexes of the type [RuX(EPh(3))(L)] (where, X=Cl/Br; E=As/P; L=dianion of the Schiff bases derived from acetoacetanilide with o-phenylenediamine and salicylaldehyde/o-hydroxyacetophenone/o-vanillin/2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde) have been synthesized from the reactions of equimolar reactions of [RuX(3)(EPh(3))(3)] and Schiff bases in benzene. The new Ru(III) Schiff base complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, electronic, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectra, EPR spectral studies, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical studies. The new complexes were found to be effective catalysts for aryl-aryl coupling and the oxidation of alcohols into their corresponding carbonyl compounds, respectively, using molecular oxygen atmosphere at ambient temperature. Further, the new Ru(III) Schiff base complexes were screened for their antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholera, Salomonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureaus.
TI  - [Antagonistic properties of enterococci isolated from gastrointestinal tract of long-livers].
AB  - The strains with antagonistic activity against indicator strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella enterica were revealed among 58 Enterococcus strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of long-livers. The influence of different components of MRS medium on the antagonistic effect was established. Antagonistic activity remained on the medium without glucose in 36% of strains, on the medium without tween 80--in 60% of strains, on the medium without sodium acetate and ammonium citric acid--in 65% of strains. The activity both for the lack of K2HPO4, MgSO4 and MnSO4, and in the absence of complex nitrogen sources (peptone, beef extract, yeast extract and hepatic extract) was shown in 76% of strains.
TI  - Clubbed [1,2,3] triazoles by fluorine benzimidazole: a novel approach to H37Rv inhibitors as a potential treatment for tuberculosis.
AB  - A Novel Clubbed [1,2,3] triazoles with fluorine benzimidazole series of H37Rv strain inhibitors, potentially useful for the treatment of tuberculosis is disclosed on the basis of promising results of preliminary antimicrobial study. Evaluation of the SAR of substitution within these series has followed the identification of a range of compounds. Some of the derivatives are under further evaluation showing better considerable activity compared to rifampin.
TI  - Synthesis and recovery of high bioactive phenolics from table-olive brine process wastewater.
AB  - The generated wastewater of table-olive brine processing contains a high amount of polyphenols which are endowed with interesting biological activities. The ethyl acetate extract (EAE) of such wastewater shows high hydroxytyrosol (HT) and tyrosol concentrations of 690 and 98 mg g(-1) dry weight extract, respectively. Phenolic compounds analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-Azinobis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate] radicals. Total polyphenol content was estimated with the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Hydroxytyrosol has DPPH and ABTS radicals scavenging activities higher than 2,6-di-tert-butyl-hydroxytoluene (BHT), while triacetylated hydroxytyrosol (triAcHT) was devoid of any antioxidant activity. The assessment of these antioxidant compounds in biological systems was carried out by the determination of their in vitro cytotoxicity against two different human cancer cell lines (HeLa and DG75) and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using the MTT assay. The 50% cytotoxic concentrations were ranged between 27 and 210 microg mL(-1) for Hela and DG75. At the same concentration range, the EAE and the pure HT and triAcHT exhibited an insignificant cytotoxicity against PBL. Incubation of HeLa and DG75 cells with non-cytotoxic concentrations of EAE, HT or triAcHT resulted in a remarkable protection from the oxidative stress induced by Fe(2+). The antimicrobial activity evaluated by the broth dilution NCCL method using Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica) bacteria and (Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger) fungi showed a broad spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal effect of table-olives-EAE, HT and triAcHT. The MICs vary from 125 to 500 microg mL(-1) for bacteria and from 500 to 2000 microg mL(-1) for fungi.
TI  - Innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by neurons expressing NPR-1/GPCR.
AB  - A large body of evidence indicates that metazoan innate immunity is regulated by  the nervous system, but the mechanisms involved in the process and the biological importance of such control remain unclear. We show that a neural circuit involving npr-1, which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) related to mammalian neuropeptide Y receptors, functions to suppress innate immune responses. The immune inhibitory function requires a guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-gated ion channel encoded by tax-2 and tax-4 as well as the soluble guanylate cyclase GCY-35. Furthermore, we show that npr-1- and gcy-35-expressing sensory neurons actively suppress immune responses of nonneuronal tissues. A full-genome microarray analysis on animals with altered neural function due to mutation in npr-1 shows an enrichment in genes that are markers of innate immune responses, including those regulated by a conserved PMK-1/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These results present evidence that neurons directly control innate immunity in C. elegans, suggesting that GPCRs may participate in neural circuits that receive inputs from either pathogens or infected sites and integrate them to coordinate appropriate immune responses.
TI  - Determination of pyrophosphorylated forms of lipid A in Gram-negative bacteria using a multivaried mass spectrometric approach.
AB  - Lipid A isolated from several bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and various strains of Yersinia) showed abundant formation of pyrophosphate anions upon ion dissociation. Pyrophosphate [H(3)P(2)O(7)](-) and/or [HP(2)O(6)](-) anions were observed as dominant fragments from diphosphorylated lipid A anions regardless of the ionization mode (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization or electrospray ionization), excitation mode (collisional activation or infrared photoexcitation), or mass analyzer (time-of-flight/time-of-flight, tandem quadrupole, Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry). Dissociations of anions from model lipid phosphate, pyrophosphate, and hexose diphosphates confirmed that pyrophosphate fragments were formed abundantly only in the presence of an intact pyrophosphate group in the analyte molecule and were not due to intramolecular rearrangement upon ionization, ion-molecule reactions, or rearrangement following activation. This indicated that pyrophosphate groups are present in diphosphorylated lipid A from a variety of Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of the stability of cell-surface components of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF-MS following preservation on lenticule discs.
AB  - Strains representing the species Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus were randomly selected to assess the consistency of cells preserved on lenticule discs to those archived in traditional freeze-dried ampoules. Each matched pair was cultured using identical conditions and analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) to profile the surface-associated molecules of the cells. In addition, the cytosolic/membrane-bound proteins of C. coli and S. aureus strains were further analysed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS. The mass spectral profiles in all cases showed a high degree of concordance between cells preserved by both methods and suggest that the properties of cells preserved on lenticule disc are consistent with those archived by the traditional method of freeze-drying.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model microorganism for investigation of chemotactic  behaviors in ecosystem.
AB  - Motile bacteria sense changes in the concentration of chemicals in environments and respond in a behavioral manner. This behavioral response is called chemotaxis. Bacterial chemotaxis can be viewed as an important prelude to metabolism, prey-predator relationships, symbiosis, infections, and other ecological interactions in biological communities. Genome analysis reveals that a large number of environmental motile bacteria possess a number of genes involved in chemosensing and chemotatic signal transduction. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a very complex chemosensory system with more than 20 chemotaxis (che) genes in five distinct clusters and 26 chemoreceptor (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein [mcp]) genes. Among the 26 MCPs of P. aeruginosa, nine have been identified as MCPs for amino acids, inorganic phosphate, oxygen, ethylene, and volatile chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, whereas 3 MCPs were demonstrated to be involved in biofilm formation and biosynthesis of type IV pilus. Six che genes are essential for chemotactic responses, while genes in Pil-Chp cluster and Wsp cluster are involved in type IV pilus synthesis and twitching motility and biofilm formation, respectively. P. aeruginosa, with its complex chemotaxis system, is a better model microorganism for investigating ecological aspects of chemotaxis in environmental bacteria than Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which possess a relatively simpler chemotaxis system.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Synthesis of some novel imidazole-based dicationic carbazolophanes as potential antibacterials.
AB  - Synthesis of fluorescent imidazole-based dicationic carbazolophanes incorporating various spacer units is described. Interestingly, the cyclophanes 2a and 5a incorporating a pyridine moiety exhibited superior antibacterial activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria in the tested concentrations as compared to the other cyclophanes as well as the test control, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and tetracycline.
TI  - Skim milk enhances the preservation of thawed -80 degrees C bacterial stocks.
AB  - The results from bacterial strain recovery efforts following hurricanes Katrina and Rita are reported. Over 90% of strains frozen in 10% skim milk were recovered whereas various recovery rates were observed for glycerol-stored stocks (56% and 94% of Escherichia coli, depending upon the laboratory). These observations led to a viability comparison of Streptococcus pyogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Salmonella enterica subsp. Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli strains stored in glycerol or skim milk. In all bacteria examined, 10% skim milk resulted in significantly longer viability after thawing than 15% glycerol solutions currently used in most laboratories.
TI  - The PhoQ histidine kinases of Salmonella and Pseudomonas spp. are structurally and functionally different: evidence that pH and antimicrobial peptide sensing contribute to mammalian pathogenesis.
AB  - The PhoQ sensor kinase is essential for Salmonella typhimurium virulence for animals, and a homologue exists in the environmental organism and opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. S. typhimurium PhoQ (ST-PhoQ) is repressed by millimolar concentrations of divalent cations and activated by antimicrobial peptides and at acidic pH. ST-PhoQ has a periplasmic Per-ARNT-Sim domain, a fold commonly employed for ligand binding. However, substrate binding is instead accomplished by an acidic patch in the periplasmic domain that interacts with the inner membrane through divalent cation bridges. The DNA sequence encoding this acidic patch is absent from Pseudomonas phoQ (PA-PhoQ). Here, we demonstrate that PA-PhoQ binds and is repressed by divalent cations, and can functionally complement a S. typhimurium phoQ-null mutant. Mutational analysis and NMR spectroscopy of the periplasmic domains of ST-PhoQ and PA-PhoQ indicate distinct mechanisms of binding divalent cation. The data are consistent with PA-PhoQ binding metal in a specific ligand-binding pocket. PA-PhoQ was partially activated by acidic pH but not by antimicrobial peptides. S. typhimurium expressing PA-PhoQ protein were attenuated for virulence in a mouse model, suggesting that the ability of Salmonella to sense host environments via antimicrobial peptides and acidic pH is an important contribution to pathogenesis.
TI  - Copper and quaternary ammonium cations exert synergistic bactericidal and antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Biofilms are slimy aggregates of microbes that are likely responsible for many chronic infections as well as for contamination of clinical and industrial environments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent hospital pathogen that is well known for its ability to form biofilms that are recalcitrant to many different antimicrobial treatments. We have devised a high-throughput method for testing combinations of antimicrobials for synergistic activity against biofilms, including those formed by P. aeruginosa. This approach was used to look for changes in biofilm susceptibility to various biocides when these agents were combined with metal ions. This process identified that Cu(2+) works synergistically with quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs; specifically benzalkonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, myristalkonium chloride, and Polycide) to kill P. aeruginosa biofilms. In some cases, adding Cu(2+) to QACs resulted in a 128-fold decrease in the biofilm minimum bactericidal concentration compared to that for single-agent treatments. In combination, these agents retained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that also eradicated biofilms of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Cholerasuis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. To investigate the mechanism of action, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to show that Cu(2+) and QACs do not interact in aqueous solutions, suggesting that each agent exerts microbiological toxicity through independent biochemical routes. Additionally, Cu(2+) and QACs, both alone and in combination, reduced the activity of nitrate reductases, which are enzymes that are important for normal biofilm growth. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that Cu(2+) and QACs are effective combinations of antimicrobials that may be used to kill bacterial biofilms.
TI  - Grapefruit juice and its furocoumarins inhibits autoinducer signaling and biofilm formation in bacteria.
AB  - Cell-to-cell communications in bacteria mediated by small diffusible molecules termed as autoinducers (AI) are known to influence gene expression and pathogenicity. Oligopeptides and N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHL) are major AI molecules involved in intra-specific communication in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria respectively, whereas boronated-diester molecules (AI-2) are involved in inter-specific communication among both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Naturally occurring furocoumarins from grapefruit showed >95% inhibition of AI-1 and AI-2 activities based on the Vibrio harveyi based autoinducer bioassay. Grapefruit juice and furocoumarins also inhibited biofilm formation by Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that grape fruit juice and furocoumarins could serve as a source to develop bacterial intervention strategies targeting microbial cell signaling processes.
TI  - Probing structure-activity relationships in bactericidal peptide betapep-25.
AB  - Cationic peptides, known to disrupt bacterial membranes, are being developed as promising agents for therapeutic intervention against infectious disease. In the present study, we investigate structure-activity relationships in the bacterial membrane disruptor betapep-25, a peptide 33-mer. For insight into which amino acid residues are functionally important, we synthesized alanine-scanning variants of betapep-25 and assessed their ability to kill bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) and to neutralize LPS (lipopolysaccharide). Activity profiles were found to vary with the bacterial strain examined. Specific cationic and smaller hydrophobic alkyl residues were crucial to optimal bactericidal activity against the Gram-negative bacteria, whereas larger hydrophobic and cationic residues mediated optimal activity against Gram-positive Staph. aureus. Lysine-substituted norleucine (n-butyl group) variants demonstrated that both charge and alkyl chain length mediate optimal activity. In terms of LPS neutralization, activity profiles were essentially the same against four species of LPS (E. coli 055 and 0111, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae), and different for two others (Ps. aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens), with specific hydrophobic, cationic and, surprisingly, anionic residues being functionally important. Furthermore, disulfide-bridged analogues demonstrated that an anti parallel beta-sheet structure is the bioactive conformation of betapep-25 in terms of its bactericidal, but not LPS endotoxin neutralizing, activity. Moreover, betapep-25 variants, like the parent peptide, do not lyse eukaryotic cells. This research contributes to the development and design of novel antibiotics.
TI  - Investigation of four (99m)Tc-labeled bacteriophages for infection-specific imaging.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated radiolabeled bacteriophages for specific detection of infection through gamma imaging. Previously, a (99m)Tc-labeled M13 phage demonstrated specific binding for its host Escherichia coli in vitro and in mice through imaging. METHODS: This study was extended to phages P22, E79, VD-13 and phage 60. Each was radiolabeled with (99m)Tc using the chelator MAG(3), and were evaluated for binding to host and non-host bacteria in vitro and in a mouse infection model. RESULTS: In vitro, each (99m)Tc-phage bound to its host at least 4-fold higher than to non-host bacteria. For example, (99m)Tc-E79 showed 10- to 20-fold greater binding to host Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to non-host Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, and (99m)Tc-phage 60 showed 20-fold greater binding to host Klebsiella pneumoniae over non-hosts. Mice received host or non-host bacteria in one thigh, and 3 h later, the (99m)Tc-phages were administered intravenously. After a further 3 h, the tissues were counted. Liver accumulation was highest for (99m)Tc-E79, averaging 39% compared to an average of 13% for the other (99m)Tc-phages. Animals infected with host bacteria showed infected thigh/normal thigh ratios of 14.2 for (99m)Tc-E79, 2.9 for (99m)Tc-P22, 3.5 for (99m)Tc-VD-13 and 2.1 for (99m)Tc-phage 60. CONCLUSIONS: Although specific host binding was observed in vitro for each of these four (99m)Tc-phages, only (99m)Tc-E79 showed specificity for its host in an in vivo model.
TI  - A new family of lysozyme inhibitors contributing to lysozyme tolerance in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Lysozymes are ancient and important components of the innate immune system of animals that hydrolyze peptidoglycan, the major bacterial cell wall polymer. Bacteria engaging in commensal or pathogenic interactions with an animal host have evolved various strategies to evade this bactericidal enzyme, one recently proposed strategy being the production of lysozyme inhibitors. We here report the discovery of a novel family of bacterial lysozyme inhibitors with widespread homologs in gram-negative bacteria. First, a lysozyme inhibitor was isolated by affinity chromatography from a periplasmic extract of Salmonella Enteritidis, identified by mass spectrometry and correspondingly designated as PliC (periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of c-type lysozyme). A pliC knock-out mutant no longer produced lysozyme inhibitory activity and showed increased lysozyme sensitivity in the presence of the outer membrane permeabilizing protein lactoferrin. PliC lacks similarity with the previously described Escherichia coli lysozyme inhibitor Ivy, but is related to a group of proteins with a common conserved COG3895 domain, some of them predicted to be lipoproteins. No function has yet been assigned to these proteins, although they are widely spread among the Proteobacteria. We demonstrate that at least two representatives of this group, MliC (membrane bound lysozyme inhibitor of c-type lysozyme) of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also possess lysozyme inhibitory activity and confer increased lysozyme tolerance upon expression in E. coli. Interestingly, mliC of Salmonella Typhi was picked up earlier in a screen for genes induced during residence in macrophages, and knockout of mliC was shown to reduce macrophage survival of S. Typhi. Based on these observations, we suggest that the COG3895 domain is a common feature of a novel and widespread family of bacterial lysozyme inhibitors in gram-negative bacteria that may function as colonization or virulence factors in bacteria interacting with an animal host.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activities of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with 2-benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work we present the synthesis, structural and spectroscopic characterisation of a series of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with benzimidazole (bz) and its 2-benzimidazole derivatives: 2-aminobenzimidazole (2ab), albendazole (abz) and tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (ntb). The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Their cytotoxic activity was also evaluated using human cancer lines, HeLa, HCT-15 and SKLU-1. The halide tetrahedral compounds [Co(bz)2Br2] 3, [Zn(2ab)2Cl2].0.5H2O 11, [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14, [Co(abz)Br2(H2O)] 15, [Zn(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 17 and [Zn(abz)Br2(H2O)].H2O 18 displayed similar minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values against Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, comparable to those of amoxicillin and chloramphenicol. Additionally, 11 showed a wide range of activity towards Gram(+) and Gram(-) microorganisms. The tetradentate ntb and its trigonal bipyramidal cobalt(II) and zinc(II) compounds were active, regardless of the anion present in the complex. Compound [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14 showed promising activity in HeLa cells, while [Co(ntb)Br]Br.H2O 21 inhibited Hela and HCT-15 cell lines.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols.
AB  - A series of nine 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols 2a-2i were synthesized and their anti-fungal activity against pathogenic strains of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans, and antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains of Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumonae and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated using different assay systems. 1-Chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active anti-fungal compound against three pathogenic strains under study, i.e., A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. niger; the compound showed more than 90% inhibition of growth of A. fumigatus at a concentration of 5.85 microg/ml in disc diffusion assay. Interestingly, 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol did not show any toxicity up to a concentration of 4000 microg/ml. Although 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was about 8 times less active than the standard compound amphotericin B, its toxicity was many more fold less than the toxicity of amphotericin B. Further, 1-chloro-3-(2',6'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against C. albicans. In the anti-microbial assay, 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against Salmonella typhi and 1-chloro-3-(3',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active compound against P. aeruginosa. Although, the activities of 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol are about half the activity of the standard anti-bacterial compound tetracycline, these compounds also were many fold less toxic than the standard drug.
TI  - Vaccines and immunotherapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A number of different vaccines and several monoclonal antibodies have been developed in the last decades for active and passive vaccination against the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These approaches include vaccine antigens such as lipopolysaccharide, surface polysaccharides, polysaccharide-protein conjugates, flagella, outer membrane proteins, pili, whole formalin-killed P. aeruginosa cells, live-attenuated P. aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica strains expressing P. aeruginosa antigens and DNA sequences. While many of these experimental vaccines and monoclonal antibodies have been tested in preclinical trials, only a few have reached clinical phases and none of these vaccines has obtained market authorization. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief summary of the present state of the development of vaccines and immunotherapies against P. aeruginosa infections. According to the different types of infection caused by P. aeruginosa--localized on mucosal surfaces such as the airways or systemic infection in the blood stream--several potential routes suggesting optimal means to administer the experimental vaccines are presented. Finally, the inherent problem of testing P. aeruginosa candidate vaccines in patient populations is discussed.
TI  - Bioprotection of Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. Eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing and API 50CH. Most of them pertained to Leuconostoc spp. and Lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to Weissella spp. and Lactococcus lactis. Growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. The strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. Treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced the cell count of S. typhimurium and E .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of L. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. Results support the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.
TI  - The Salmonellae PhoQ sensor: mechanisms of detection of phagosome signals.
AB  - Sensor histidine kinases are widely used by prokaryotes to regulate gene expression in response to environmental signals, and such sensing is essential for virulence for plants and animals. PhoQ is one such sensor kinase that is conserved across a variety of Gram-negative pathogens and functions as part of a two-component system with its transcriptional regulator PhoP. Salmonella typhimurium PhoPQ is one of the most studied two-component systems and has been demonstrated to regulate hundreds of genes encoding the majority of virulence properties including intracellular survival, invasion, lipid A structure, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, and phagosome alteration. PhoQ is activated within acidified phagosomes and host tissues. PhoQ binds divalent cations to form bridges with the membrane that maintain the PhoQ repressed state. Antimicrobial peptides and acidic pH activate PhoQ and these signals, present within phagosomes and intestinal tissues, may serve as specific signatures of the host environment for Gram-negative pathogens. This review will focus on recent progress in the molecular details of PhoQ structure and sensing of defined signals. In addition, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium PhoQ are compared, providing evidence that a subset of PhoQ proteins of environmental organisms evolved more limited sensing capability using a different structural sensing mechanism.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activities of clay minerals against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The capacity to properly address the worldwide incidence of infectious diseases lies in the ability to detect, prevent and effectively treat these infections. Therefore, identifying and analysing inhibitory agents are worthwhile endeavours in an era when few new classes of effective antimicrobials have been developed. The use of geological nanomaterials to heal skin infections has been evident since the earliest recorded history, and specific clay minerals may prove valuable in the treatment of bacterial diseases, including infections for which there are no effective antibiotics, such as Buruli ulcer and multidrug-resistant infections. METHODS: We have subjected two iron-rich clay minerals, which have previously been used to treat Buruli ulcer patients, to broth culture testing of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria to assess the feasibility of using clay minerals as therapeutic agents. RESULTS: One specific mineral, CsAg02, demonstrated bactericidal activity against pathogenic Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium marinum, and a combined bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas another mineral with similar structure and bulk crystal chemistry, CsAr02, had no effect on or enhanced bacterial growth. The <0.2 microm fraction of CsAg02 and CsAg02 heated to 200 or 550 degrees C retained bactericidal activity, whereas cation-exchanged CsAg02 and CsAg02 heated to 900 degrees C no longer killed E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that specific mineral products have intrinsic, heat-stable antibacterial properties, which could provide an inexpensive treatment against numerous human bacterial infections.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Invasiveness and intracellular growth of multidrug-resistant salmonella and other pathogens in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens of human and animal origins is a major public health concern. For a better understanding of the health consequences of multidrug-resistant bacteria transmitted from animal products to humans, the host interaction of zoonotic Salmonella isolates along with other pathogenic and commensal bacteria was evaluated using a human intestinal Caco-2 cell system. Multidrug-resistant S. Agona, S. Heidelberg, and S. Typhimurium possessed plasmid-mediated class 1 integrons. The S. Typhimurium DT104 isolate from ground beef showed the well-known genotypic and phenotypic resistance characteristics of the species, and contained the chromosomally located class 1 integron. Among the multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates, the S. Heidelberg 219 had the highest invasion number at 1.0 x 10(4) CFU/mL, followed by the S. Typhimurium DT104 isolate at 7.7 x 10(3) CFU/mL. Listeria monocytogenes was the best performer among the tested species in invading the Caco-2 cell. Multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also able to invade the cells. The invasion of S. Heidelberg 219, S. Typhimurium DT104, L. monocytogenes, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa into the Caco-2 cells was not affected even in the presence of commensal E. coli. During the intracellular growth of S. Heidelberg 219, S. Typhimurium DT104, and L. monocytogenes, the bacterial counts increased 2 log cycles in 9 h in the Caco-2 cells. Therefore, these strains could rapidly proliferate after their invasion into the cells.
TI  - A female-specific pentraxin, CrOctin, bridges pattern recognition receptors to bacterial phosphoethanolamine.
AB  - Pathogen recognition and binding are crucial functions of innate immunity. It has been observed that the short pentraxin superfamily including C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P component are pathogen pattern recognition receptors (PRR) in the plasma. We isolated and characterized a novel and distinctive pentraxin from the plasma of horseshoe crab, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, henceforth named CrOctin, which binds to bacteria via phosphoethanolamine (PE), a chemical component present on lipid A and core polysaccharide moieties of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Infection enhances the formation of the PRR interactome constituting CrOctin, CRP and galactose-binding protein. In particular, infection increases the affinity of CRP to CrOctin by 1000-fold. Furthermore, we observed that by binding to PE, CrOctin acts as a linker that bridges the PRR interactome to the inner core of LPS. On the other hand, under normal physiological conditions, binding of CrOctin to PE appears to obscure other PRR from interacting directly with PE. Interestingly, the cluster of "CrOctin-interactive PRR" is sex specific. We report, for the first time, the change in PRR protein profiles with a distinctive gender difference during Pseudomonas infection.
TI  - Structural biology of membrane-intrinsic beta-barrel enzymes: sentinels of the bacterial outer membrane.
AB  - The outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are replete with integral membrane  proteins that exhibit antiparallel beta-barrel structures, but very few of these proteins function as enzymes. In Escherichia coli, only three beta-barrel enzymes are known to exist in the outer membrane; these are the phospholipase OMPLA, the protease OmpT, and the phospholipidColon, two colonslipid A palmitoyltransferase PagP, all of which have been characterized at the structural level. Structural details have also emerged for the outer membrane beta-barrel enzyme PagL, a lipid A 3-O-deacylase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lipid A can be further modified in the outer membrane by two beta-barrel enzymes of unknown structure; namely, the Salmonella enterica 3'-acyloxyacyl hydrolase LpxR, and the Rhizobium leguminosarum oxidase LpxQ, which employs O(2) to convert the proximal glucosamine unit of lipid A into 2-aminogluconate. Structural biology now indicates how beta-barrel enzymes can function as sentinels that remain dormant when the outer membrane permeability barrier is intact. Host immune defenses and antibiotics that perturb this barrier can directly trigger beta-barrel enzymes in the outer membrane. The ensuing adaptive responses occur instantaneously and rapidly outpace other signal transduction mechanisms that similarly function to restore the outer membrane permeability barrier.
TI  - Variable Number Of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) and its application in bacterial epidemiology.
AB  - Molecular epidemiology is the using of molecular techniques to study bacterial distribution in human populations. Recently molecular epidemiologist benefit from several techniques such as Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing method to typing bacterial strains. Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing is a tool for genotyping and provides data in a simple and numeric format based on the number of repetitive sequences. VNTR for first time identified in M. tuberculosis as Mycobacterial Interspersed Repeat Units (MIRUs). General terms of VNTR have now been reported in Bacillus anthracis, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - Effect of a simple chlorine dioxide method for controlling five foodborne pathogens, yeasts and molds on blueberries.
AB  - The effect of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) on controlling foodborne pathogens, yeasts, and molds on blueberries was studied. Five pathogens were spot-inoculated on the skin of blueberries. A sachet containing necessary chemicals for generation of ClO(2) was used to provide 320 ppm of ClO(2) in 7.5 l of water. The efficacy of different concentrations (1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 ppm) of ClO(2) and various contact times (10s; 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 min; and 1h and 2h) were studied. ClO(2) was most effective in reducing Listeria monocytogenes (4.88 log cfu/g) as compared to the other pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by 2.16 log cfu/g after 5 min when treated with 15 ppm of ClO(2). Relatively short treatment time was more effective in reducing Salmonella Typhimurium than longer treatment time for most concentrations. The highest reduction (4.56 log cfu/g) of Staphylococcus aureus was achieved with 15 ppm of ClO(2) for 30 min. When treated for 2h with 5 ppm of ClO(2), Yersinia enterocolitica was reduced by 3.49 log cfu/g. Fifteen ppm of ClO(2) reduced natural yeasts and molds by 2.82 log cfu/g after 1h. Concentrations of ClO(2) decreased over time. When exposed to blueberries, ClO(2) concentrations were further reduced, showing significant degradation.
TI  - Bacterial-induced hepoxilin A3 secretion as a pro-inflammatory mediator.
AB  - Bacterial infections at epithelial surfaces, such as those that line the gut and  the lung, stimulate the migration of neutrophils through the co-ordinated actions of chemoattractants secreted from pathogen-stimulated epithelial cells. One such factor involved in attracting polymorphonuclear leukocytes across the epithelium and into the lumen has until recently remained elusive. In 2004, we identified the eicosanoid, hepoxilin A(3), to be selectively secreted from the apical surface of human intestinal or lung epithelial cells stimulated with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. In this role, the function of hepoxilin A(3) is to guide neutrophils, via the establishment of a gradient, across the epithelial tight junction complex. Interestingly, interruption of the synthetic pathway of hepoxilin A(3) blocks the apical release of hepoxilin A(3)in vitro and the transmigration of neutrophils induced by S. typhimurium both in in vitro and in vivo models of inflammation. Such results have led to the discovery of a completely novel pathway that is not only critical for responses to bacterial pathogens but also has broad implications for inflammatory responses affecting mucosal surfaces in general. Thus, the objective of this review was to highlight the recent findings that implicate hepoxilin A(3) as a key regulator of mucosal inflammation.
TI  - Cutting edge: natural DNA repetitive extragenic sequences from gram-negative pathogens strongly stimulate TLR9.
AB  - Bacterial DNA exerts immunostimulatory effects on mammalian cells via the intracellular TLR9. Although broad analysis of TLR9-mediated immunostimulatory potential of synthetic oligonucleotides has been developed, which kinds of natural bacterial DNA sequences are responsible for immunostimulation are not known. This work provides evidence that the natural DNA sequences named repetitive extragenic palindromic (REPs) sequences present in Gram-negative bacteria are able to produce innate immune system stimulation via TLR9. A strong induction of IFN-alpha production by REPs from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis was detected in splenocytes from 129 mice. In addition, the involvement of TLR9 in immune stimulation by REPs was confirmed using B6.129P2-Tlr9(tm1Aki) knockout mice. Considering the involvement of TLRs in Gram-negative septic shock, it is conceivable that REPs play a role in its pathogenesis. This study highlights REPs as a potential novel target in septic shock treatment.
TI  - Characterization of the IncA/C plasmid pCC416 encoding VIM-4 and CMY-4 beta-lactamases.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the antibiotic resistance regions of pCC416, a VIM-4- and CMY-4-encoding plasmid from clinical enterobacteria, and to elucidate its relation with the CMY-encoding plasmids widely diffused in Salmonella. METHODS: The enterobacterial multiresistant plasmid pCC416 was derived from an Escherichia coli transconjugant and characterized. Conventional and long-range PCR assays were performed using primers specific for VIM-4- and CMY-4-encoding segments of pCC416. Amplicons were characterized by sequencing. blaVIM-4, blaCMY-4 and IntI1-specific probes were prepared from PCR products and used for the identification of various pCC416 clones. VIM- and CMY-positive BamHI and Sau3AI fragments of pCC416 were cloned into pACYC184 and their sequences were determined by gene walking. RESULTS: The pCC416 plasmid contained two distinct resistant loci carrying beta-lactamase genes. The blaVIM-4 gene was part of an integron located in a complex, multidrug-resistant region of novel structure, interspersed with mobile elements or remnants thereof and being similar to various regions of other resistance plasmids. Nevertheless, a region in the 3' end of this structure resembled the respective region found in a CMY-2-encoding plasmid from Salmonella. The blaCMY-4 gene was identified within an 11.3 kb region also related to the CMY-2-encoding plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: pCC416 probably evolved from an IncA/C2, CMY-encoding plasmid through acquisition of a VIM-encoding In4-type integron providing an example of accretion of resistance determinants in a single replicon.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Polyamine effects on antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria.
AB  - Biogenic polyamines (e.g., spermidine and spermine) are a group of essential polycationic compounds found in all living cells. The effects of spermine and spermidine on antibiotic susceptibility were examined with gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium bacteria and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Exogenous spermine exerted a dose-dependent inhibition effect on the growth of E. coli, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and S. aureus but not P. aeruginosa, as depicted by MIC and growth curve measurements. While the MICs of polymyxin and ciprofloxacin were in general increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine in P. aeruginosa, this adverse effect was not observed in enteric bacteria and S. aureus. It was found that spermine and spermidine can decrease the MICs of beta-lactam antibiotics in all strains as well as other types of antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. Significantly, the MICs of oxacillin for MRSA Mu50 and N315 were decreased more than 200-fold in the presence of spermine, and this effect of spermine was retained when assessed in the presence of divalent ions (magnesium or calcium; 3 mM) or sodium chloride (150 mM). The effect of spermine on the sensitization of P. aeruginosa and MRSA to antibiotics was further demonstrated by population analysis and time-killing assays. The results of checkerboard assays with E. coli and S. aureus indicated a strong synergistic effect of spermine in combination with beta-lactams and chloramphenicol. The decreased MICs of beta-lactams implied that the possible blockage of outer membrane porins by exogenous spermine or spermidine did not play a crucial role in most cases. In contrast, only the MIC of imipenem against P. aeruginosa was increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine, and this resistance effect was abolished in a mutant strain devoid of the outer membrane porin OprD. In E. coli, the MICs of carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were decreased in two acrA mutants devoid of a major efflux pump, AcrAB. However, retention of the spermine effect on antibiotic susceptibility in two acrA mutants of E. coli suggested that the AcrAB efflux pump was not the target for a synergistic effect by spermine and antibiotics and ruled out the hypothesis of spermine serving as an efflux pump inhibitor in this organism. In summary, this interesting finding of the effect of spermine on antibiotic susceptibility provides the basis for a new potential approach against drug-resistant pathogens by use of existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Computational and experimental analyses of mammalian arylamine N-acetyltransferase structure and function.
AB  - Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) play an important role in the metabolism of arylamine and hydrazine drugs and many arylamine procarcinogens. The two human N-acetyltransferases, NAT1 and NAT2, are widely distributed in human tissues and are highly polymorphic. Although many xenobiotic procarcinogens and drugs are known mammalian NAT substrates, it is unclear what physiological roles these enzymes might play, what endogenous substrates they primarily act upon, or the mechanisms underlying the functional effects of specific NAT gene coding region single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Analyses of mammalian NAT protein structures can greatly help to answer these questions. Homology modeling techniques can be used to approximate mammalian NAT structures using known bacterial NAT crystal structures as templates. In comparison to the bacterial template NATs used for homology modeling, mammalian NATs have a 17-residue insert of unknown structure and function. Homology modeling analyses yielded two different alignments (Modeler 8v1 or 3DCoffee algorithms) that placed this insert in two likely alternative locations. Secondary structure prediction techniques and experimental analyses of a series of human NAT2 mutants with artificial deletions/replacements of the insert region distinguished one of these alternatives as the most likely insert location and provided a better understanding of its structure and function. This study demonstrates both the utility and limitations of computational structural modeling with proteins that differ as much as the mammalian and bacterial NATs.
TI  - Intranasal immunization with heterologously expressed polysaccharide protects against multiple Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
AB  - Surface-expressed bacterial polysaccharides are often immunodominant, protective  antigens. However, these antigens are chemically and serologically highly heterogeneous, and conjugation to protein carriers is often necessary to enhance their immunogenicity. Here we show the efficacy of intranasal immunization of mice with attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing the O antigen portion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide. P. aeruginosa is an ideal model system because it can cause a myriad of localized and systemic infections. In particular, this bacterium is a leading cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia and is responsible for infections after burns and after eye injury. In addition, there are mouse models of infection that mimic the clinical manifestations of P. aeruginosa infections. Immunized mice were highly protected against infection, with long-lasting immunity to acute P. aeruginosa pneumonia, whereas mice immunized with Salmonella containing only the cloning vector or PBS were not. Prophylactic and therapeutic administration of sera from vaccinated animals protected naive mice. Intranasal vaccination also provided complete protection from infections after burns and reduced pathology after corneal abrasions. These results indicate that intranasal delivery of heterologously expressed polysaccharide antigens provides protection at distinct sites of infection. This approach for the expression and delivery of polysaccharide antigens as recombinant immunogens could be easily adapted to develop vaccines for many infectious agents, without the need for complicated purification and conjugation procedures.
TI  - DgrA is a member of a new family of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate receptors and controls flagellar motor function in Caulobacter crescentus.
AB  - Bacteria are able to switch between two mutually exclusive lifestyles, motile single cells and sedentary multicellular communities that colonize surfaces. These behavioral changes contribute to an increased fitness in structured environments and are controlled by the ubiquitous bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). In response to changing environments, fluctuating levels of c-di-GMP inversely regulate cell motility and cell surface adhesins. Although the synthesis and breakdown of c-di-GMP has been studied in detail, little is known about the downstream effector mechanisms. Using affinity chromatography, we have isolated several c-di-GMP-binding proteins from Caulobacter crescentus. One of these proteins, DgrA, is a PilZ homolog involved in mediating c-di-GMP-dependent control of C. crescentus cell motility. Biochemical and structural analysis of DgrA and homologs from C. crescentus, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated that this protein family represents a class of specific diguanylate receptors and suggested a general mechanism for c-di-GMP binding and signal transduction. Increased concentrations of c-di-GMP or DgrA blocked motility in C. crescentus by interfering with motor function rather than flagellar assembly. We present preliminary evidence implicating the flagellar motor protein FliL in DgrA-dependent cell motility control.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Emblica officinalis and Coriandrum sativum against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
AB  - Present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of Emblica officinalis (amla) and Coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of Gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. Aqueous infusion and decoction of Emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (270), Klebsiella pneumoniae (51), K. ozaenae (3), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), Salmonella typhi (1), S. paratyphi A (2), S. paratyphi B (1) and Serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
TI  - Biofilm formation by multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium phage type DT104 and other pathogens.
AB  - The biofilm-forming capability of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Heidelberg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from humans, animal farms, and retail meat products was evaluated by using a microplate assay. The tested bacterial species showed interstrain variation in their capabilities to form biofilms. Strong biofilm-forming strains of S. enterica serotypes, E. coli O157: H7, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii were resistant to at least four of the tested antibiotics. To understand their potential in forming biofilms in food-processing environments, the strong biofilm formers grown in beef, turkey, and lettuce broths were further investigated on stainless steel and glass surfaces. Among the tested strains, Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT104 (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104) isolated from retail beef formed the strongest biofilm on stainless steel and glass in beef and turkey broths. K. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, and P. aeruginosa were also able to form strong biofilms on the tested surface materials. Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 developed a biofilm on stainless steel in beef and turkey broths through (i) initial attachment to the surface, (ii) formation of microcolonies, and (iii) biofilm maturation. These findings indicated that Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 alongwith other bacterial pathogens could be a source of cross-contamination during handling and processing of food.
TI  - Exploitation of eukaryotic ubiquitin signaling pathways by effectors translocated by bacterial type III and type IV secretion systems.
AB  - The specific and covalent addition of ubiquitin to proteins, known as ubiquitination, is a eukaryotic-specific modification central to many cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and hormone signaling. Polyubiquitination is a signal for the 26S proteasome to destroy earmarked proteins, but depending on the polyubiquitin chain topology, it can also result in new protein properties. Both ubiquitin-orchestrated protein degradation and modification have also been shown to be essential for the host's immune response to pathogens. Many animal and plant pathogenic bacteria utilize type III and/or type IV secretion systems to inject effector proteins into host cells, where they subvert host signaling cascades as part of their infection strategy. Recent progress in the determination of effector function has taught us that playing with the host's ubiquitination system seems a general tactic among bacteria. Here, we discuss how bacteria exploit this system to control the timing of their effectors' action by programming them for degradation, to block specific intermediates in mammalian or plant innate immunity, or to target host proteins for degradation by mimicking specific ubiquitin/proteasome system components. In addition to analyzing the effectors that have been described in the literature, we screened publicly available bacterial genomes for mimicry of ubiquitin proteasome system subunits and detected several new putative effectors. Our understanding of the intimate interplay between pathogens and their host's ubiquitin proteasome system is just beginning. This exciting research field will aid in better understanding this interplay, and may also provide new insights into eukaryotic ubiquitination processes.
TI  - Characterization of a simple bacterial consortium for effective treatment of wastewaters with reactive dyes and Cr(VI).
AB  - A microbial consortia consisting of three bacteria isolated from tanning and textile wastewaters revealed high capacity to simultaneously bioaccumulate dye and Cr(VI). The identity of the bacteria were determined by 16S rRNA gene analysis to be closely related to Ochrobactrium sp., Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dependence of initial pH values and range of concentrations of the dye Reactive Black B (33.2-103.1 mg l(-1)) and Cr(VI) (19.9-127.6 mg l(-1)) were examined to find the effect of pH on the dye and Cr(VI) bioaccumulation. Optimal pH for growth of the consortia in media containing 35 mg l(-1) dye and 50 mg l(-1) Cr(VI) was determined to be around 8. The Cr(VI) bioaccumulation by the consortia was rapid in media containing molasses with or without reactive dye with a maximum Cr(VI) bioaccumulation yield ranging from 90% to 99% within a 2-4d period. A slightly lower yield for the dye bioaccumulation was measured with a maximum dye bioaccumulation of 80% at 59.3 mg l(-1) dye and 69.8 mg l(-1) Cr(VI). The highest specific Cr uptake value was obtained as 76.7 mg g(-1) at 117.1 mg l(-1) Cr(VI) and 50.8 mg l(-1) dye concentration. This ability to bioaccumulate dye and Cr(VI) was more efficient than the enriched sludge from which they were isolated.
TI  - GATA transcription factor required for immunity to bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - In the past decade, Caenorhabditis elegans has been used to dissect several genetic pathways involved in immunity; however, little is known about transcription factors that regulate the expression of immune effectors. C. elegans does not appear to have a functional homolog of the key immune transcription factor NF-kappaB. Here we show that that the intestinal GATA transcription factor ELT-2 is required for both immunity to Salmonella enterica and expression of a C-type lectin gene, clec-67, which is expressed in the intestinal cells and is a good marker of S. enterica infection. We also found that ELT-2 is required for immunity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Lack of immune inhibition by DAF-2, which negatively regulates the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, rescues the hypersusceptibility to pathogens phenotype of elt-2(RNAi) animals. Our results indicate that ELT-2 is part of a multi-pathogen defense pathway that regulates innate immunity independently of the DAF-2/DAF-16 signaling pathway.
TI  - Dual role of the MgtC virulence factor in host and non-host environments.
AB  - MgtC is required for intramacrophage replication of intracellular pathogens and growth in low Mg(2+) medium. A link between these two phenotypes has been proposed due to putative Mg(2+) deprivation inside phagosome. MgtC is part of a family of proteins that share a conserved N-terminal transmembrane domain and a variable C-terminal domain. A combination of predictive and experimental approaches indicates that the Salmonella MgtC C-terminal domain is cytoplasmic, adopts a fold also found in metal transporters and RNA interacting domain, and does not bind Mg(2+). MgtC homologues from diverse gamma-proteobacteria, including the extracellular pathogens Yersinia pestis, Photorhabdus luminescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been expressed in a SalmonellaDeltamgtC strain. The Y. pestis MgtC fully replaced the Salmonella MgtC whereas P. luminescens or P. aeruginosa MgtC complemented only in low Mg(2+) medium, thus dissociating for the first time the two MgtC-related phenotypes. In addition, we identified single amino acids changes that prevent or promote MgtC role in macrophages without affecting MgtC role in low Mg(2+) culture. A SalmonellaDeltamgtC strain showed elongated and autoaggregated bacteria in low Mg(2+) medium but not in macrophages. Taken together our results suggest that MgtC has a dual role when bacteria localize in macrophages or low Mg(2+) environment.
TI  - [Proteins with GGDEF and EAL domains: their role in bacterial metabolism].
AB  - The availability of multiple bacterial genome sequences has led to the discovery  of several conserved domains of proteins. Recently, GGDEF and EAL domains have been described as domains responsible for the synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP, a second messenger in bacteria. c-di-GMP has been involved in cellulose production and identified as a global regulator of several processes such as biofilm formation, motility and virulence, presumibly through a modification of the cell surface properties.
TI  - Phytochemical and antimicrobial study of an antidiabetic plant: Scoparia dulcis L.
AB  - The antimicrobial and antifungal effects of different concentrations of chloroform/methanol fractions of Scoparia dulcis were investigated. The isolated fractions were tested against different bacteria like Salmonella typhii, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris and fungal strains such as Alternaria macrospora, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and Fusarium oxysporum. The isolated fractions exhibited significant antimicrobial and antifungal activity against all the tested organisms compared with respective reference drugs. The isolated fractions of S. dulcis showed properties like antimicrobial and antifungal activities that will enable researchers in turn to look for application-oriented principles.
TI  - Mutant prevention concentration of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) is a new concept meant to face the increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance by using antibiotic concentrations able to prevent the selection of single-step resistant mutants. In the present study, the MPCs of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were evaluated against fully susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, representative single-step mutants arising after exposure to sub-MPC antibiotic concentrations were investigated for molecular basis of their fluoroquinolone resistance phenotypes. MPC value was recorded when more than 10(10) CFU/mL were spread on Mueller Hinton Agar supplemented with different antibiotic concentrations (from 1X to 16X MIC value). MICs of original strains as well as single-step mutants were determined in presence or absence of the Efflux Pump Inhibitor Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN). Moreover point mutations in the QRDR of the gyrA and parC genes were investigated by sequencing. The enrofloxacin MPC values were 4-16-fold higher than ciprofloxacin values. E. coli and S. Typhimurium representative single-step mutants showed reduced susceptibilities associated with point mutations in the QRDR of the gyrA gene or efflux pump system. P. aeruginosa mutants showed resistance phenotypes associated predominantly with efflux pump system activity. According to in vitro MPC data, ciprofloxacin showed a better efficacy than enrofloxacin, in preventing the selection of E. coli, S. Typhimurium and P. aeruginosa single-step mutants. However, in relation to AUC/MPC ratio, the MPC concept can be applied in vivo to ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin for E. coli and S. Typhimurium but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Type IV pilin structures: insights on shared architecture, fiber assembly, receptor binding and type II secretion.
AB  - Type IV pili are long, flexible filaments that extend from the surface of Gram-negative bacteria and are formed by the polymerization of pilin subunits. This review focuses on the structural information available for each pilin subclass, type IVa and type IVb, highlighting the contributions crystal and nuclear magnetic resonance structures have made in understanding pilus function and assembly. In addition, the type II secretion pseudopilus subunit structure and helical assembly is compared to that of the type IV pilus. The pilin subunits adopt an alphabeta-roll fold formed by the hydrophobic packing of the C-terminal half of a long alpha-helix against an antiparallel beta-sheet. The conserved N-terminal half of the same alpha-helix, as well as two sequence- and structurally-variable regions, protrude from this globular head domain. Filament models have a hydrophobic core formed by the signature long alpha-helices, with variable regions at the filament surface.
TI  - Some probiotic properties of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  - Lactobacilli have long been considered to be protective flora in the vagina. In this study, samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women, and 58 strains of Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from 10 of these women. The identification results revealed that Lactobacillus gasseri was the predominant lactobacilli in healthy women. The amounts of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) produced by Lactobacillus spp. were determined. The vaginal pH levels induced by Lactobacillus spp. strains ranged from 1.00 to 2.15. The titratable acidity of the strains ranged from 0.27 to 1.33%. The H(2)O(2) concentration produced in the lactobacilli strains ranged between 1.01 microg/ml and 15.50 microg/ml. The antimicrobial effects of the lactobacilli against the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2392, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 29212 and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis RSKK 171 were also determined by the agar diffusion methods.
TI  - Heat-shock transcription factor (HSF)-1 pathway required for Caenorhabditis elegans immunity.
AB  - Innate immunity comprises physical barriers, pattern-recognition receptors, antimicrobial substances, phagocytosis, and fever. Here we report that increased temperature results in the activation of a conserved pathway involving the heat-shock (HS) transcription factor (HSF)-1 that enhances immunity in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans. The HSF-1 defense response is independent of the p38 MAPK/PMK-1 pathway and requires a system of chaperones including small and 90-kDa inducible HS proteins. In addition, HSF-1 is needed for the effects of the DAF-2 insulin-like pathway in defense to pathogens, indicating that interacting pathways control stress response, aging, and immunity. The results also show that HSF-1 is required for C. elegans immunity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia pestis, and Enterococcus faecalis, indicating that HSF-1 is part of a multipathogen defense pathway. Considering that several coinducers of HSF-1 are currently in clinical trials, this work opens the possibility that activation of HSF-1 could be used to boost immunity to treat infectious diseases and immunodeficiencies.
TI  - Involvement of Toll-like receptor 5 in the recognition of flagellated bacteria.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the immune system that detect microbial infection and trigger antimicrobial host defense responses. TLR5 is a sensor for monomeric flagellin, which is a component of bacterial flagella known to be a virulence factor. In this study we generated TLR5-deficient mice and investigated the role of TLR5 signaling in the detection of flagellin and antibacterial immune responses to Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that TLR5 is essential for the recognition of bacterial flagellin both in vivo and ex vivo. TLR5 contribution to antibacterial host response to i.p. infection with S. typhimurium or intranasal administration of P. aeruginosa may be masked by TLR4 or other sensing mechanisms. By using radiation bone marrow chimera, we showed that upon i.p. injection of flagellin immune responses are mediated by lymphoid cells, whereas resident cells are required for the initiation of response upon intranasal flagellin administration. These results suggest that flagellin recognition in different organs is mediated by distinct TLR5-expressing cells and provide insights into the cooperation of the TLR5 and TLR4 signaling pathways used by the innate immune system in the recognition of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Bafoudiosbulbins A, and B, two anti-salmonellal clerodane diterpenoids from Dioscorea bulbifera L. var sativa.
AB  - Two clerodane diterpenoids, Bafoudiosbulbins A 1, and B 2, together with five known compounds: tetracosanoic acid, 1-(tetracosanoyl)-glycerol, trans-tetracosanylferulate, beta-sitosterol and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-sitosterol were isolated from the tubers of Dioscorea bulbifera L. var sativa. Their structures were established by spectroscopic methods (1D and 2D-NMR, MS) and X-ray crystallographic diffraction analysis of compound 1. The CH2Cl2-soluble portion of the crude extract and the two clerodanes were screened for anti-bacterial activity using both agar diffusion and broth dilution techniques against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A and Salmonella paratyphi B. They both showed significant activities against P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, S. paratyphi A and S. paratyphi B.
TI  - Multidrug-resistance efflux pumps - not just for resistance.
AB  - It is well established that multidrug-resistance efflux pumps encoded by bacteria can confer clinically relevant resistance to antibiotics. It is now understood that these efflux pumps also have a physiological role(s). They can confer resistance to natural substances produced by the host, including bile, hormones and host-defence molecules. In addition, some efflux pumps of the resistance nodulation division (RND) family have been shown to have a role in the colonization and the persistence of bacteria in the host. Here, I present the accumulating evidence that multidrug-resistance efflux pumps have roles in bacterial pathogenicity and propose that these pumps therefore have greater clinical relevance than is usually attributed to them.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a large subunit of Salmonella typhimurium glutamate synthase (GOGAT) gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Two pathways of ammonium assimilation and glutamate biosynthesis have been identified in microorganisms. One pathway involves the NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the amination of 2-oxoglutarate to form glutamate. An alternative pathway involves the combined activities of glutamine synthetase, which aminates glutamate to form glutamine, and glutamate synthase, which transfers the amide group of glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate to yield two molecules of glutamate. We have cloned the large subunit of the glutamate synthase (GOGAT) from Salmonella typhimurium by screening the expression of GOGAT and complementing the gene in E. coli GOGAT large subunit-deficient mutants. Three positive clones (named pUC19C12, pUC19C13 and pUC19C15) contained identical Sau3AI fragments, as determined by restriction mapping and Southern hybridization, and expressed GOGAT efficiently and constitutively using its own promoter in the heterologous host. The coding region expressed in Escherichia coli was about 170 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This gene spans 4,732 bases, contains an open reading frame of 4,458 nucleotides, and encodes a mature protein of 1,486 amino acid residues (Mr = 166,208). The FMN-binding domain of GOGAT contains 12 glycine residues, and the 3Fe-4S cluster has 3 cysteine residues. The comparison of the translated amino acid sequence of the Salmonella GOGAT with sequences from other bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia pestis, Vibrio vulnificus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows sequence identity between 87 and 95%.
TI  - Vi antigen biosynthesis in Salmonella typhi: characterization of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine C-6 dehydrogenase (TviB) and UDP-N-acetylglucosaminuronic acid C-4 epimerase (TviC).
AB  - Vi antigen, the virulence factor of Salmonella typhi, has been used clinically as a molecular vaccine. TviB and TviC are two enzymes involved in the formation of Vi antigen, a linear polymer consisting of alpha-1,4-linked N-acetylgalactosaminuronate. Protein sequence analysis suggests that TviB is a dehydrogenase and TviC is an epimerase. Both enzymes are expected to be NAD(+) dependent. In order to verify their functions, TviB and TviC were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized. The C-terminal His(6)-tagged TviB protein, purified from soluble cell fractions in the presence of 10 mM DTT, shows UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 6-dehydrogenase activity and is capable of catalyzing the conversion of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to UDP-N-acetylglucosaminuronic acid (UDP-GlcNAcA) with a k(cat) value of 15.5 +/- 1.0 min(-)(1). The K(m) values of TviB for UDP-GlcNAc and NAD(+) are 77 +/- 9 microM and 276 +/- 52 microM, respectively. TviC, purified as C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein, shows UDP-GlcNAcA 4-epimerase and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) 4-epimerase activities. The K(m) values of TviC for UDP-GlcNAcA and UDP-N-acetylgalactosaminuronic acid (UDP-GalNAcA) are 20 +/- 1 microM and 42 +/- 2 microM, respectively. The k(cat) value for the conversion of UDP-GlcNAcA to UDP-GalNAcA is 56.8 +/- 0.5 min(-)(1), while that for the reverse reaction is 39.1 +/- 0.6 min(-)(1). These results show that the biosynthesis of Vi antigen is initiated by the TviB-catalyzed oxidation of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc, followed by the TviC-catalyzed epimerization at C-4 to form UDP-GalNAcA, which serves as the building block for the formation of Vi polymer. These results set the stage for future in vitro biosynthesis of Vi antigen. These enzymes may also be drug targets to inhibit Vi antigen production.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of substituted flavones, 4-thioflavones and  4-iminoflavones.
AB  - Synthesis of flavones, 4-thioflavones and 4-iminoflavones was carried out with the substitution of variable halogens, methyl, methoxy and nitro groups in the A, B and AB rings of the respective compounds and we also report here their antibacterial activity. Most of the synthesized compounds were found to be active against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Shigella flexnari, Salmonella aureus, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Activity of 4-thioflavones and 4-iminoflavones was found to be higher than that of their corresponding flavone analogues. Investigated compounds having substituents like F, OMe and NO2 at 4'-position in ring-B exhibited enhanced activity and the presence of electronegative groups in the studied compounds showed a direct relationship to the antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Cloning, sequence analysis and expression of alanine racemase gene in Pseudomonas putida].
AB  - Two distinct alanine racemase genes from Pseudomonas putida 200 were cloned and sequenced. DadX encodes a peptide of 357 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 38.82kDa. The putative product of alr gene is a peptide of 409 amino acids with molecular weight of 44.182kDa. A homology comparison revealed identities of 96.64%, 71.99%, 44.88% and 47.37% of the DadX alanine racemase to those from P. putida KT2440, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, respectively. The amino acids sequence deduced from alr gene showed the homologies of 94.38%, 22.89%, 25.72% and 26.44% to those from the microorganisms above, respectively. Two motifs believed essential to the enzyme activity are found both in DadX and Alr, such as pyridoxal-5'-phosphate binding site. Both dadX and alr were expressed in E. coli TG1. Neither alanine racemase activity or serine racemase activity was detected in the host strain. Only alanine racemase activity was found in E. coli TG1/pCTD. But both E. coli TG1/pCTA and TG1/pCBA exhibit activity toward L-alanine and L-serine. Transcription of alr gene in E. coli is independent from extraneous promoter, a result confirmed by the significant enzyme activity observed in the E. coli TG1/pCBA, which indicates the presence of a possible promoter upstream the structure gene.
TI  - Bacterial endotoxin as inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of human thrombin.
AB  - Endotoxemia caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) deleteriously affects many aspects of hemostasis. Much of this effect is well characterized as being secondary to the LPS-mediated inflammatory response, but direct effects of LPS on coagulation factors may also contribute to disregulation of the hemostatic process. Spectrophotometric assays were used to investigate the effects of LPS from different bacteria on thrombin and plasmin activities. We found that enzymatic activity of purified thrombin, but not plasmin, decreases in the presence of endotoxin. LPS-mediated inhibition of thrombin activity can be reversed by plasma gelsolin and recombinant endotoxin-neutralizing protein. Preincubation of thrombin with LPS before platelet activation results in inhibition of aggregation and secretion. Additionally, a decrease of elastic shear moduli of fibrin gels was observed when their formation was induced with thrombin preincubated with LPS or when LPS was present in fibrinogen solutions during fibrin gel formation. When added to platelet-rich plasma, after activation with collagen, LPS-inhibited thrombin activity. LPS-mediated inhibition of thrombin activity may contribute to the hemostasis dysfunctions observed during endotoxemia.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Equisetum arvense L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of the sterile stems of Equisetum arvense L. (Equisetaceae) were investigated for the first time using GC, GC/MS and (13)C-NMR. Twenty-five compounds were identified. Hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (18.34%), cis-geranyl acetone (13.74%), thymol (12.09%) and trans-phytol (10.06%) were the major constituents. A disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of this oil against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enteritidis; fungi: Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). The 1:10 dilution of the essential oil of Equisetum arvense L. was shown to possess a broad spectrum of a very strong antimicrobial activity against all tested strains.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated high-level gentamicin resistance among enteric bacteria isolated from pet turtles in Louisiana.
AB  - The sale of small turtles is banned by the Food and Drug Administration from the  U.S. market due to concerns about their excretion of Salmonella spp. To produce a safe pet for the export market, the Louisiana pet turtle industry uses gentamicin sulfate baths (1,000 microg/ml) to eradicate Salmonella spp. from turtle eggs. In 1999, we analyzed bacterial samples recovered from turtle farms and found that strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae and other bacteria, such as Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were resistant to high concentrations of gentamicin (>2,000 microg/ml) and to other aminoglycosides. The goal of this study was to identify the gene(s) which contributes to the high-level gentamicin resistance phenotype observed in bacteria from environmental samples with turtle farming activity, particularly the salmonellae, and to estimate the incidence of such genes in these bacteria. R plasmids from gentamicin-resistant strains were transferred by conjugation and transformation to naive Escherichia coli cells. Cloning and sequencing of the gentamicin resistance determinants on these plasmids revealed the presence of the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase genes aac(3)-IIa and aac(3)-VIa; the latter was present as a gene cassette of a class 1 integron. Multiplex PCR assays showed that every gentamicin-resistant isolate carried one of these acetyltransferase genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of R plasmids carrying these genes revealed different restriction profiles and sizes, indicating a dissemination of the gentamicin resistance genes through mobile molecular elements. The data presented highlight the need to develop an alternate method for the eradication of Salmonella spp. from turtle eggs.
TI  - TLR4-dependent hepcidin expression by myeloid cells in response to bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide secreted by the liver during inflammation that plays a central role in mammalian iron homeostasis. Here we demonstrate the endogenous expression of hepcidin by macrophages and neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. These myeloid cell types produced hepcidin in response to bacterial pathogens in a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent fashion. Conversely, bacterial stimulation of macrophages triggered a TLR4-dependent reduction in the iron exporter ferroportin. In vivo, intraperitoneal challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced TLR4-dependent hepcidin expression and iron deposition in splenic macrophages, findings mirrored in subcutaneous infection with group A Streptococcus where hepcidin induction was further observed in neutrophils migrating to the tissue site of infection. Hepcidin expression in cultured hepatocytes or in the livers of mice infected with bacteria was independent of TLR4, suggesting the TLR4-hepcidin pathway is restricted to myeloid cell types. Our findings identify endogenous myeloid cell hepcidin production as a previously unrecognized component of the host response to bacterial pathogens.
TI  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipid A deacylase: selection for expression and loss within the cystic fibrosis airway.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major surface component of gram-negative bacteria, and a component of LPS, lipid A, is recognized by the innate immune system through the Toll-like receptor 4/MD-2 complex. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an environmental gram-negative bacterium that opportunistically infects the respiratory tracts of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), can synthesize various structures of lipid A. Lipid A from P. aeruginosa strains isolated from infants with CF has a specific structure that includes the removal of the 3 position 3-OH C10 fatty acid. Here we demonstrate increased expression of the P. aeruginosa lipid A 3-O-deacylase (PagL) in isolates from CF infants compared to that in environmental isolates. PagL activity was increased in environmental isolates by growth in medium limited for magnesium and decreased by growth at low temperature in laboratory-adapted strains of P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa PagL was shown to be an outer membrane protein by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation. Heterologous expression of P. aeruginosa pagL in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli resulted in removal of the 3-OH C14 fatty acid from lipid A, indicating that P. aeruginosa PagL recognizes either 3-OH C10 or 3-OH C14. Finally, deacylated lipid A species were not observed in some clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with severe pulmonary disease, suggesting that loss of PagL function can occur during long-term adaptation to the CF airway.
TI  - A slow, tight-binding inhibitor of the zinc-dependent deacetylase LpxC of lipid A biosynthesis with antibiotic activity comparable to ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The zinc-dependent enzyme LpxC catalyzes the deacetylation of UDP-3-O-acyl-GlcNAc, the first committed step of lipid A biosynthesis. Lipid A is an essential component of the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making LpxC an attractive target for antibiotic design. The inhibition of LpxC by a novel N-aroyl-l-threonine hydroxamic acid (CHIR-090) from a recent patent application (International Patent WO 2004/062601 A2 to Chiron and the University of Washington) is reported here. CHIR-090 possesses remarkable antibiotic activity against both E. coli and P. aeruginosa, comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. The biological activity of CHIR-090 is explained by its inhibition of diverse LpxC orthologues at low nanomolar concentrations, including that of Aquifex aeolicus, for which structural information is available. The inhibition of A. aeolicus LpxC by CHIR-090 occurs in two steps. The first step is rapid and reversible, with a K(i) of 1.0-1.7 nM, depending upon the method of assay. The second step involves the conversion of the EI complex with a half-life of about a minute to a tightly bound form. The second step is functionally irreversible but does not result in the covalent modification of the enzyme, as judged by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. CHIR-090 is the first example of a slow, tight-binding inhibitor for LpxC and may be the prototype for a new generation of LpxC inhibitors with therapeutic applicability.
TI  - Solution structure of YggX: a prokaryotic protein involved in Fe(II) trafficking.
AB  - We report the three-dimensional structure of YggX from Salmonella enterica, determined by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy from protein labeled with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 produced by Escherichia coli cells. The protein has a beta1beta2alpha1alpha2alpha3 fold that is unique to YggX and one of its homologs, a protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 45% sequence identity whose X-ray structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1T07] was determined by a structural genomics center. The NMR structure, which revealed that the C-terminal region of YggX is dynamically disordered, explains why electron density from the corresponding region was missing in the X-ray structure of the Pseudomonas protein. Because it has been hypothesized that YggX has a role in iron trafficking, we investigated the influence of Fe(II) on the (1)H-(15)N NMR fingerprint region of nitrogen-15-labeled YggX. Several signals shifted or broadened upon the addition of excess Fe(II) under anoxic conditions, with His81 showing the largest effect. These results indicate that Fe(II) binds weakly to this protein at a region of the sequence conserved only in the subset of the YggX proteins from organisms similar to Salmonella. The finding that iron binds only weakly to YggX, and not to a highly conserved region of the structure, suggests that the role of this protein in iron homeostasis is more complex than previously thought.
TI  - Identification of core and variable components of the Salmonella enterica subspecies I genome by microarray.
AB  - We have performed microarray hybridization studies on 40 clinical isolates from 12 common serovars within Salmonella enterica subspecies I to identify the conserved chromosomal gene pool. We were able to separate the core invariant portion of the genome by a novel mathematical approach using a decision tree based on genes ranked by increasing variance. All genes within the core component were confirmed using available sequence and microarray information for S. enterica subspecies I strains. The majority of genes within the core component had conserved homologues in Escherichia coli K-12 strain MG1655. However, many genes present in the conserved set which were absent or highly divergent in K-12 had close homologues in pathogenic bacteria such as Shigella flexneri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genes within previously established virulence determinants such as SPI1 to SPI5 were conserved. In addition several genes within SPI6, all of SPI9, and three fimbrial operons (fim, bcf, and stb) were conserved within all S. enterica strains included in this study. Although many phage and insertion sequence elements were missing from the core component, approximately half the pseudogenes present in S. enterica serovar Typhi were conserved. Furthermore, approximately half the genes conserved in the core set encoded hypothetical proteins. Separation of the core and variant gene sets within S.enterica subspecies I has offered fundamental biological insight into the genetic basis of phenotypic similarity and diversity across S. enterica subspecies I and shown how the core genome of these pathogens differs from the closely related E. coli K-12 laboratory strain.
TI  - Antimicrobial constituents from fruits of Ailanthus altissima SWINGLE.
AB  - A new naturally occurring sterol, compound 5, and six known stigmasterols were isolated from fruits of Ailanthus altissima Swingle by repeated column chromatography and RP-HPLC. Their structures were identified as, 5alpha-stigmastane-3,6-dione (1), 3beta-hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one (2), stigmast-5-ene-3beta, 7alpha-diol (3), 6alpha-hydroxystigmast-4-en-3-one (4), 5alpha-stigmastane-3beta, 6beta-diol (5), stigmast-4-ene-3beta, 6alpha-diol (6), stigmast-5-ene-3beta, 7alpha, 20xi-triol (7) by spectral analysis and comparison with the published data. These compounds have not been reported from genus Ailanthus, whereas compound 7 was identified by NMR for the first time. In addition, the 95% ethanol extract and compounds from the fruits of Ailanthus altissima SWINGLE were assayed for in vitro antimicrobial activity. The extract was potent active against the assayed bacteria while compounds 3 and 7 exhibited moderate activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial action of tea: the commonest beverage of Asia.
AB  - The methanolic extract of leaves of Camellia sinensis (L) O. KUNTZE was screened  for antimicrobial property against 111 bacteria comprising 2 genera of Gram positive and 7 genera of Gram negative bacteria. Most of these strains were inhibited by the compound at 10-50 microg/ml level and few strains were sensitive even at lower concentrations (5 microg/ml). The bacteria could be arranged in the decreasing order of sensitivity towards the compound in the following manner: Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibacterial activity of compound could also be confirmed in vivo. When it was given to Swiss strain of white mice at different dosages (30, 60 microg/mouse), it could significantly protect the animals challenged with 50 MLD of Salmonella typhimurium NCTC 74. According to Chi square test the in vivo data were highly significant (p<0.001).
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - Flagellar filaments of the deep-sea bacteria Idiomarina loihiensis belong to a family different from those of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The helical filaments of the bacterial flagella so far studied seem to be universal in the bacterial kingdom. Despite the variation in flagellin molecular masses, which range from 24 kDa to 62 kDa in different species, there are only two forms: either the so-called Normal (left-handed) or the Curly (right-handed). The Normal and Curly helical forms are asymmetric; the two characteristic helical parameters, which are the pitch and diameter, of Normal filaments are twice those of Curly filaments. Both the universality of these two helical forms and their asymmetry are biological puzzles. We found that the marine bacteria Idiomarina loihiensis have flagella with left-handed Curly-like filaments. Analysis of the polymorphic forms under different pH conditions showed that the Curly-like filaments are actually Normal filaments having a smaller pitch and diameter than those of Salmonella typhimurium. A minor modification of Calladine's model for a filament lattice can explain the variant helical forms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa filaments also belong to the family of I.loihiensis filaments. Thus, there are at least two families of flagella filaments.
TI  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of bacteria and pollen.
AB  - A technique for distinguishing biological material based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is reported in this work. Of particular interest is biological material that can be airborne. Silver colloidal particles with diameters in the range 10 to 20 nm and with a characteristic ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) absorption band at 400 nm were used to obtain SERS spectra of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria and a number of tree and grass pollens (Cupressus arizonica (cypress), Sequoia sempervirens (redwood), Populus deltoides (cottonwood), Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), and Anthoxanthum odoratum (sweet vernal grass)). While differences in the SERS spectra among the bacteria were small, we found that the pollen spectra we analyzed could readily be distinguished from the bacteria spectra, and there were significant differences between pollen from different families. In order to obtain reproducible results, we studied the parameters controlling the interaction between the analyte and the nanoscale metallic surface. Our results show that the volume ratio of analyte to colloidal particles must be within a narrow range of values to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the SERS spectra and minimize the fluorescence from the analyte. Also, we found that the time-dependent behavior of colloidal/bacterial suspensions (or adsorption rate of the silver colloid particles on the bacteria) is strongly dependent on pH, density of bacteria in solution, and even, to some extent, the type of bacteria.
TI  - The nematode Panagrellus redivivus is susceptible to killing by human pathogens at 37 degrees C.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a host for the study of bacteria that cause disease in mammals. However, a significant limitation of the model is that C. elegans is not viable at 37 degrees C. We report that the gonochoristic nematode Panagrellus redivivus survives at 37 degrees C and maintains its life cycle at temperatures up to and including 31.5 degrees C. The C. elegans pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, but not Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, reduced P. redivivus lifespan. Of four strains of Burkholderia multivorans tested, one reduced P. redivivus lifespan at both temperatures, one was avirulent at both temperatures and two strains reduced P. redivivus lifespan only at 37 degrees C. The mechanism by which one of these strains killed P. redivivus at 37 degrees C, but not at 25 degrees C, was investigated further. Killing required viable bacteria, did not involve bacterial invasion of tissues, is unlikely to be due to a diffusible, bacterial toxin and was not associated with increased numbers of live bacteria within the intestine of the worm. We believe B. multivorans may kill P. redivivus by a temperature-regulated mechanism similar to B. pseudomallei killing of C. elegans.
TI  - Peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. We used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive NTHi strain R2866 (also called Int1). Over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward R2866 in a dose-dependent manner. Five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (KQRTSIRATEGCLPS; clone hi3/17), while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. All of the bactericidal phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. Clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of clinical NTHi isolates and H. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica) bacteria. These data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north India.
AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India, over a period of 1 year from August 2003 to July 2004. Among the 567 qualifying samples, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), Escherichia coli (15.17%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria other than Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. Staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and Enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria other than other Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. Among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of Gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against Enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. However, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all Gram-negative isolates. For Gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus spp. Combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for Gram-negative pathogens. Hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Binding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AlgZ to sites upstream of the algZ promoter leads to repression of transcription.
AB  - Mucoid variants of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce the  exopolysaccharide alginate and colonize the respiratory tracts of cystic fibrosis patients. The genes encoding the alginate biosynthetic enzymes are clustered in a single operon, which is under tight transcriptional control. One essential activator of the alginate operon is AlgZ, a proposed ribbon-helix-helix DNA binding protein that shares 30% amino acid identity with the Mnt repressor of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium bacteriophage P22. In the current study, we examined the role of AlgZ as an autoregulator. Using single-copy algZ-lacZ transcription fusions, an increase in algZ transcription was observed in an algZ mutant compared to the isogenic wild-type strain, suggesting that AlgZ may have an additional role as a repressor. To identify the AlgZ binding site, overlapping regions upstream of algZ were incubated with AlgZ and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Specific binding activity was localized to a region spanning from 66 to 185 base pairs upstream of the algZ transcriptional start site. Two AlgZ binding sites were defined using copper-phenanthroline footprinting and deletion analyses, with one site centered at 93 base pairs and the other centered at 161 base pairs upstream of the algZ promoter. Deletion of both binding sites resulted in the loss of AlgZ binding. These results indicate that AlgZ represses algZ transcription, and this activity is mediated by multiple AlgZ-DNA interactions.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of saponins from Acacia auriculiformis.
AB  - Acaciaside A and B, two acylated bisglycoside saponins originally isolated from the funicles of Acacia auriculiformis, are known to have antihelminthic activity. Their antifungal and antibacterial activities were investigated. Complete inhibition of conidial germination of Aspergillus ochraceous and Curvularia lunata was recorded at 300 microg/ml or less whereas to inhibit the growth of Bacillus megaterium, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 700 microg/ml or higher concentrations of the mixture was required. Two catabolic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, responded differentially in fungi and bacteria against sublethal concentrations of the compound when assayed from their cell free extracts. An increased specific activity of the enzymes in bacteria and a decrease activity in fungi indicate a possible different mechanism of inhibition of saponins on the organisms tested.
TI  - Nauplathizine, a new unusual O-heteroside from Nauplius aquaticus (L).
AB  - A novel O-heteroside, (3RS,4RS)-3,4-dihydroxy-4-(2-hydroxy-5-acetylphenyl)-2-[(beta-O-glucopyranosyl)me thyl]-but-1-ene (1), named nauplathizine, and a previously known compound, acetophenone-4-O-glucoside (2), were isolated from the antibacterial acetone extract of the aerial parts of Nauplius aquaticus (L) (Asteraceae, Inulae). The structure of 1 was established via its acetylated derivative by means of spectroscopic and chemical data.
TI  - Genetic environment and expression of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase blaPER-1 gene in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The genetic location of the gene coding for the expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase  PER-1 was analyzed in a series of gram-negative isolates. It was identified as part of a composite transposon bracketed by two novel insertion elements, ISPa12 and ISPa13, belonging to the IS4 family that possess transposases that share 63% amino acid identity and that are chromosomally located in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia stuartii, and Acinetobacter baumannii. On the contrary, the bla(PER-1) gene was identified just downstream of an ISPa12 element but not within a composite transposon when it was located on a plasmid in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and A. baumannii isolates. In both cases, expression of the bla(PER-1) gene was driven by promoter sequences located in ISPa12.
TI  - Functional characterization of WaaL, a ligase associated with linking O-antigen polysaccharide to the core of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa B-band lipopolysaccharide is synthesized  by assembling O-antigen-repeat units at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane by nonprocessive glycosyltransferases, followed by polymerization on the periplasmic face. The completed chains are covalently attached to lipid A core by the O-antigen ligase, WaaL. In P. aeruginosa the process of ligating these O-antigen molecules to lipid A core is not clearly defined, and an O-antigen ligase has not been identified until this study. Using the sequence of waaL from Salmonella enterica as a template in a BLAST search, a putative waaL gene was identified in the P. aeruginosa genome. The candidate gene was amplified and cloned, and a chromosomal knockout of PAO1 waaL was generated. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from this mutant is devoid of B-band O-polysaccharides and semirough (SR-LPS, or core-plus-one O-antigen). The mutant PAO1waaL is also deficient in the production of A-band polysaccharide, a homopolymer of D-rhamnose. Complementation of the mutant with pPAJL4 containing waaL restored the production of both A-band and B-band O antigens as well as SR-LPS, indicating that the knockout was nonpolar and waaL is required for the attachment of O-antigen repeat units to the core. Mutation of waaL in PAO1 and PA14, respectively, could be complemented with waaL from either strain to restore wild-type LPS production. The waaL mutation also drastically affected the swimming and twitching motilities of the bacteria. These results demonstrate that waaL in P. aeruginosa encodes a functional O-antigen ligase that is important for cell wall integrity and motility of the bacteria.
TI  - Biotinylation facilitates the uptake of large peptides by Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli can normally only take up small peptides less than 650 Da, or five to six amino acids, in size. We have found that biotinylated peptides up to 31 amino acids in length can be taken up by E. coli and that uptake is dependent on the biotin transporter. Uptake could be competitively inhibited by free biotin or avidin and blocked by the protonophore carbonyl m-chlorophenylhydrazone and was abolished in E. coli mutants that lacked the biotin transporter. Biotinylated peptides could be used to supplement the growth of a biotin auxotroph, and the transported peptides were shown to be localized to the cytoplasm in cell fractionation experiments. The uptake of biotinylated peptides was also demonstrated for two other gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This finding may make it possible to create new peptide antibiotics that can be used against gram-negative pathogens. Researchers have used various moieties to cause the illicit transport of compounds in bacteria, and this study demonstrates the illicit transport of the largest known compound to date.
TI  - Mouse paneth cell secretory responses to cell surface glycolipids of virulent and attenuated pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Mouse Paneth cells respond to bacteria and bacterial cell surface antigens by discharging secretory granules into the lumen of small intestinal crypts (T. Ayabe et al., Nat. Immunol. 1:113-118, 2000). To investigate mechanisms regulating these responses, purified surface glycolipid molecules with known acyl chain modifications and attenuated properties were tested for the ability to stimulate Paneth cell secretion. The antigens included lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from wild-type and msbB-null Escherichia coli and phoP-null and phoP-constitutive Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains, as well as LPS, lipid A, and lipoteichoic acid from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes grown in Mg2+-limited media. Measurements of total secreted protein, secreted lysozyme, and the bactericidal peptide activities of collected secretions showed that the purified antigens elicited similar secretory responses from Paneth cells in mouse crypts ex vivo, regardless of glycolipid acyl chain modification. Despite their impaired Tlr4 pathway, Paneth cells in ex vivo C3H/HeJ mouse crypts released equivalent amounts of bactericidal peptide activity in response to purified bacterial antigens, including lipid A. Thus, mouse Paneth cells respond equivalently to purified bacterial cell envelope glycolipids, regardless of functional Tlr4, the structural properties of glycolipid acyl chains, or their association with virulence in humans.
TI  - Serum amyloid A protein binds to outer membrane protein A of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid A (SAA) is the major acute phase protein in man and most mammals. We observed SAA binding to a surprisingly large number of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The binding was found to be high affinity and rapid. Importantly, this binding was not inhibited by high density lipoprotein with which SAA is normally complexed in serum. Binding was also observed when bacteria were offered serum containing SAA. Ligand blots following SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gels revealed two major ligands of 29 and 35 kDa that bound SAA when probing with radiolabeled SAA or SAA and monoclonal anti-SAA. Following fractionation the ligand was found in the outer membrane fraction of E. coli and was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to be outer membrane protein A (OmpA). OmpA-deficient E. coli did not bind SAA, and following purification of OmpA the protein retained binding activity. The ligands on other bacteria were likely to be homologues of OmpA because wild type, but not OprF-deficient, P. aeruginosa bound SAA.
TI  - REP code: defining bacterial identity in extragenic space.
AB  - Through the analysis of 57 bacterial genomes we have detected repetitive extragenic palindromic DNA sequences (REPs) in 11 species. For a sequence to be considered as REP, the following criteria should be met: (i) It should be extragenic, (ii) palindromic, (iii) of a length between 21 and 65 bases and (iv) should constitute more than 0.5% of the total extragenic space. Species-specific REPs have been found in human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Neisseria meningitidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia conorii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the soil bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Pseudomonas putida and Sinorhizobium meliloti.
TI  - Dissemination of lipid A deacylases (pagL) among gram-negative bacteria: identification of active-site histidine and serine residues.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the main constituents of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane. It usually consists of a highly variable O-antigen, a less variable core oligosaccharide, and a highly conserved lipid moiety, designated lipid A. Several bacteria are capable of modifying their lipid A architecture in response to external stimuli. The outer membrane-localized lipid A 3-O-deacylase, encoded by the pagL gene of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, removes the fatty acyl chain from the 3 position of lipid A. Although a similar activity was reported in some other Gram-negative bacteria, the corresponding genes could not be identified. Here, we describe the presence of pagL homologs in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Although the overall sequence similarity is rather low, a conserved domain could be distinguished in the C-terminal region. The activity of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bordetella bronchiseptica pagL homologs was confirmed upon expression in Escherichia coli, which resulted in the removal of an R-3-hydroxymyristoyl group from lipid A. Upon deacylation by PagL, E. coli lipid A underwent another modification, which was the result of the activity of the endogenous palmitoyl transferase PagP. Furthermore, we identified a conserved histidine-serine couple as active site residues, suggesting a catalytic mechanism similar to serine hydrolases. The biological function of PagL remains unclear. However, because PagL homologs were found in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic species, PagL-mediated deacylation of lipid A probably does not have a dedicated role in pathogenicity.
TI  - Wzx proteins involved in biosynthesis of O antigen function in association with the first sugar of the O-specific lipopolysaccharide subunit.
AB  - One of the most common pathways for the export of O-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) across the plasma membrane requires the participation of the Wzx protein. Wzx belongs to a family of integral membrane proteins that share little conservation in their primary amino acid sequence, making it difficult to delineate functional domains. This paper reports the cloning and expression in Escherichia coli K-12 of various Wzx homologues from different bacteria as FLAG epitope-tagged protein fusions. A reconstitution system for O16 LPS synthesis was used to assess the ability of each Wzx protein to complement an E. coli K-12 Deltawzx mutant. The results demonstrate that Wzx proteins from O-antigen systems that use N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine for the initiation of the biosynthesis of the O repeat can fully complement the formation of O16 LPS. Partial complementation was seen with Wzx from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a system that uses N-acetylfucosamine in the initiation reaction. In contrast, there was negligible complementation with the Wzx protein from Salmonella enterica, a system in which galactose is the initiating sugar. These results support a model whereby the first sugar of the O repeat can be recognized by the O-antigen translocation machinery.
TI  - A rapid microplate method for quantifying inhibition of bacterial adhesion to eukaryotic cells.
AB  - Adhesion of bacteria to the mucosal epithelial cell surface is the first step in  infection, and studies have shown that inhibition of this step may be useful therapeutically. To test compounds that may prevent bacterial binding to a number of epithelial cell lines, we have developed a high-throughput adhesion assay using a microtitre plate system and bacteria that have been modified to express firefly luciferase. This method has proved to be a sensitive, rapid, and reproducible system for screening antiadhesive agents for their effects on bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Oral vaccination of BALB/c mice with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing Pseudomonas aeruginosa O antigen promotes increased survival in an acute fatal pneumonia model.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial pneumonia. We compared the efficacies of oral and intraperitoneal (i.p.) vaccinations of BALB/c mice with attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL3261 expressing P. aeruginosa serogroup O11 O antigen to protect against P. aeruginosa infection in an acute fatal pneumonia model. Oral and i.p. vaccines elicited O11-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, but IgA was observed only after oral immunization. Challenge of orally vaccinated mice with an O11 strain (9882-80) at 6 and 12 times the 50% lethal dose showed increased survival in mice that received the vaccine compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)- and vector-treated controls; no difference in survival was seen with a heterologous strain, 6294 (serogroup O6). In addition, significant protection against 9882-80 was not observed in i.p. vaccinated animals. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from immunized mice harbored O11-specific IgA and IgG in orally immunized mice but only modest levels of IgG in i.p. vaccinated mice. To correlate protection, opsonophagocytosis assays were performed with pooled sera from orally immunized animals. Efficient killing of five O11 clinical isolates was observed, while no killing was noted with 6294, indicating that the recombinant SL3261 oral vaccine induces an O11-specific reaction. We next determined the ability of orally vaccinated animals to clear bacteria from their lungs. Following P. aeruginosa challenge, the numbers of viable bacteria were significantly fewer in orally vaccinated animals than in PBS- and vector-treated controls. Our results suggest that oral immunization with recombinant SL3261 is efficacious in protection against pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Transferable antibiotic resistance elements in Haemophilus influenzae share a common evolutionary origin with a diverse family of syntenic genomic islands.
AB  - Transferable antibiotic resistance in Haemophilus influenzae was first detected in the early 1970s. After this, resistance spread rapidly worldwide and was shown to be transferred by a large 40- to 60-kb conjugative element. Bioinformatics analysis of the complete sequence of a typical H. influenzae conjugative resistance element, ICEHin1056, revealed the shared evolutionary origin of this element. ICEHin1056 has homology to 20 contiguous sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Systematic comparison of these homologous sequences resulted in identification of a conserved syntenic genomic island consisting of up to 33 core genes in 16 beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria. These diverse genomic islands shared a common evolutionary origin, insert into tRNA genes, and have diverged widely, with G+C contents ranging from 40 to 70% and amino acid homologies as low as 20 to 25% for shared core genes. These core genes are likely to account for the conjugative transfer of the genomic islands and may even encode autonomous replication. Accessory gene clusters were nestled among the core genes and encode the following diverse major attributes: antibiotic, metal, and antiseptic resistance; degradation of chemicals; type IV secretion systems; two-component signaling systems; Vi antigen capsule synthesis; toxin production; and a wide range of metabolic functions. These related genomic islands include the following well-characterized structures: SPI-7, found in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi; PAP1 or pKLC102, found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and the clc element, found in Pseudomonas sp. strain B13. This is the first report of a diverse family of related syntenic genomic islands with a deep evolutionary origin, and our findings challenge the view that genomic islands consist only of independently evolving modules.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa protease IV degrades surfactant proteins and inhibits surfactant host defense and biophysical functions.
AB  - Pulmonary surfactant has two distinct functions within the lung: reduction of surface tension at the air-liquid interface and participation in innate host defense. Both functions are dependent on surfactant-associated proteins. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is primarily responsible for respiratory dysfunction and death in cystic fibrosis patients and is also a leading pathogen in nosocomial pneumonia. P. aeruginosa secretes a number of proteases that contribute to its virulence. We hypothesized that P. aeruginosa protease IV degrades surfactant proteins and results in a reduction in pulmonary surfactant host defense and biophysical functions. Protease IV was isolated from cultured supernatant of P. aeruginosa by gel chromatography. Incubation of cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with protease IV resulted in degradation of surfactant proteins (SP)-A, -D, and -B. SPs were degraded in a time- and dose-dependent fashion by protease IV, and degradation was inhibited by the trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor Nalpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl ketone (TLCK). Degradation by protease IV inhibited SP-A- and SP-D-mediated bacterial aggregation and uptake by macrophages. Surfactant treated with protease IV was unable to reduce surface tension as effectively as untreated surfactant, and this effect was inhibited by TLCK. We speculate that protease IV may be an important contributing factor to the development and propagation of acute lung injury associated with P. aeruginosa via loss of surfactant function within the lung.
TI  - Effect of dosage on immunogenicity of a Vi conjugate vaccine injected twice into  2- to 5-year-old Vietnamese children.
AB  - In a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled previous trial, the efficacy of Vi-rEPA for typhoid fever in 2- to 5-year-olds was 89.0% for 46 months. Vi-rEPA contained 25 microg of Vi and induced a greater-than-eightfold rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-Vi in all of the vaccinees tested. In this investigation, we conducted a dosage-immunogenicity study of 5, 12.5, and 25 microg of Vi-rEPA in this age group. Two doses of Vi-rEPA were injected 6 weeks apart. Blood samples were taken before and at 10 weeks (4 weeks after the second injection) and 1 year later. All postimmunization geometric mean (GM) levels were higher than the preimmune levels (P < 0.0001). At 10 weeks, the GM IgG anti-Vi level elicited by 25 microg (102 EU/ml) was higher than those elicited by 12.5 microg (74.7 EU/ml) and 5 microg (43 EU/ml) (P < 0.004): all of the children had > or = 3.52 EU/ml (estimated minimum protective level). One year later, the levels declined about sevenfold (13.3 and 11.3 versus 6.43 EU/ml, P < 0.0001) but remained significantly higher than the preimmune levels (P < 0.0001), and >96% of the children had a greater-than-eightfold rise. This study also confirmed the safety and consistent immunogenicity of the four lots of Vi-rEPA used in this and previous trials.
TI  - Enhanced immunogenicity in the murine airway mucosa with an attenuated Salmonella live vaccine expressing OprF-OprI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - We constructed an oral live vaccine based on the attenuated aroA mutant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL3261 expressing outer membrane proteins F and I (OprF-OprI) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and investigated it in a mouse model. Strains with in vivo inducible protein expression with the PpacC promoter showed good infection rates and immunogenicity but failed to engender detectable antibodies in the lung. However, a systemic booster vaccination following an oral primary immunization yielded high immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibody levels in both upper and lower airways superior to conventional systemic or mucosal booster vaccination alone. In addition, the proportion of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies suggested that the systemic booster does not alter the more TH1-like type of response induced by the oral Salmonella primary vaccination. We conclude that an oral primary systemic booster vaccination strategy with an appropriate mucosal vector may be advantageous in diseases with the risk of P. aeruginosa airway infection, such as cystic fibrosis.
TI  - The art of serendipity: killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by human pathogens as a model of bacterial and fungal pathogenesis.
AB  - The nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, has been used to develop a facile model system of host-pathogen interactions to identify basic evolutionarily conserved pathways associated with microbial pathogenesis. The model involves the killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by a variety of human pathogens. Several virulence-related genes in a variety of pathogens previously shown to be involved in mammalian infection have also been shown to play a role in Caenorhabditis elegans killing. Screening of large numbers of microbial mutants for attenuation in a mammalian model would require thousands of mice, rats or rabbits. In contrast, the Caenorhabditis elegans model allows rapid identification of mutants in microbial genes associated with pathogenesis and then these phenotypes can be confirmed in a relevant mammalian model.
TI  - Modulation of AraC family member activity by protein ligands.
AB  - A number of AraC family transcriptional activators bind low-molecular-weight ligands that modulate the activity of these proteins. Recently, it has become clear that the activity of several virulence-related AraC family members is regulated through the direct interaction of protein ligands. These interactions, in general, function to activate or repress the transcription of virulence genes in response to specific extracellular stimuli. The identification and characterization of several protein ligands that modify the activity of AraC family members in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica are discussed herein.
TI  - Detection of low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  - Biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. An antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. The principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture Listeria cells on the fiber. Capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, C11E9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by launching a 635-nm laser light from an Analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. This immunosensor was specific for L. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other Listeria species or other microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Lactobacillus plantarum, Carnobacterium gallinarum, Hafnia alvei, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. Fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. The sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) CFU/ml for a pure culture of L. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees C. When L. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees C with 3.5% NaCl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively. In less than 24 h, this method could detect L. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 CFU/g after enrichment in buffered Listeria enrichment broth.
TI  - A rapid method for determining the antimicrobial activity of novel natural molecules.
AB  - Preservatives used in the Agro-food industries may be of natural origin or obtained chemically. Because of the increasing interest of consumers in food products that contain only natural ingredients, studies on preservative molecules of natural origin, such as organic acids or peptides, have been reported in the past several years. Such studies, which require numerous assays, may be limited by the large amount of molecules required. Microscale assays provide an opportunity for testing natural components available in low quantity. This study examined a rapid method that used microplates for the evaluation of anti-microbial substances. The method was validated using five foodborne pathogens. It required a low amount of product and was convenient for the determination of correlations between the bacterial growth inhibition and concentration of the antimicrobial substance.
TI  - Expression, purification, characterization and structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa arylamine N-acetyltransferase.
AB  - The gene for NAT (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (panat) has been cloned from genomic DNA, and the gene product (PANAT) expressed as an N-terminal histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli and purified via nickel ion affinity chromatography. The specific activities of PANAT against a broad range of substrates have been investigated and compared with those of other prokaryotic NAT enzymes. For most arylamine substrates identified, PANAT exhibits in vitro specific activities typically one order of magnitude greater than those of recombinant NAT enzymes from Mycobacterium smegmatis or Salmonella typhimurium. Among the substrates of PANAT so far identified are the anti-tubercular drug isoniazid, 5-aminosalicylate (a drug used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease), as well as important environmental pollutants such as 3,4-dichloroaniline and 2-aminofluorene. As well as acetylating common NAT substrates, PANAT is unique among the prokaryotic NATs so far studied in acetylating the folate precursor 4-aminobenzoic acid and the folate catabolite 4-aminobenzoylglutamate. The recombinant protein has been expressed in sufficient quantity to allow protein crystallization, and we have subsequently determined the 1.95 A structure of PANAT by X-ray crystallography.
TI  - Validation of a PCR for diagnosis of typhoid fever and salmonellosis by amplification of the hilA gene in clinical samples from Colombian patients.
AB  - Validation of a PCR test to detect hilA gene sequences of Salmonella spp. was performed in blood and faeces samples from typhoid fever and salmonellosis patients. Sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR in blood samples were performed by testing: 37 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever, 34 of them confirmed by isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures; 35 patients infected with other pathogens corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4 and Enterobacter cloacae, 4) and blood samples from 150 healthy volunteers. To evaluate S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in faeces samples we studied: 34 patients with enteritis due Salmonella spp. (S. Typhimurium, 21; S. Enteritidis, 9; S. Choleraesuis, 3 and S. Agona, 1); faeces samples from 35 patients with enteric infection due to Shigella sonnei (8), Shigella flexneri (10), enteropathogenic E. coli (12), Aeromonas hydrophila (5) and faeces samples from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in blood samples were all 100 %. PCR detected three patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever and negative blood cultures. In faeces samples, S was 97 %, SP 100 %, PPV 100 % and NPV 99 %. The lowest number of c.f.u. ml(-1) detected by PCR in blood samples was 1 x 10(1) and in faeces samples 4 x 10(2).
TI  - GGDEF and EAL domains inversely regulate cyclic di-GMP levels and transition from sessility to motility.
AB  - Cyclic nucleotides represent second messenger molecules in all kingdoms of life.  In bacteria, mass sequencing of genomes detected the highly abundant protein domains GGDEF and EAL. We show here that the GGDEF and EAL domains are involved in the turnover of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) in vivo whereby the GGDEF domain stimulates c-di-GMP production and the EAL domain c-di-GMP degradation. Thus, most probably, GGDEF domains function as c-di-GMP cyclase and EAL domains as phosphdiesterase. We further show that, in the pathogenic organism Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the commensal species Escherichia coli, GGDEF and EAL domains mediate similar phenotypic changes related to the transition between sessility and motility. Thus, the data suggest that c-di-GMP is a novel global second messenger in bacteria the metabolism of which is controlled by GGDEF and EAL domain proteins.
TI  - Relationship between antibacterial activity of chitosan and surface characteristics of cell wall.
AB  - AIM: Five representative waterborne pathogens were used to illustrate the relationship between chitosan's antibacterial activity and the surface characteristics of the bacterial cell wall. METHODS: Chitosan was prepared with averaged 75% or 95% deacetylated degree to examine its antibacterial activity against waterborne pathogens. Fresh microbial inoculants for the antibacterial assessment were prepared on nutrient agar at 37 degrees for 24 h. The evaluation items of antibacterial mechanism included hydrophilicity and negative charge analysis of cell surface, and adsorptive characteristics of chitosan to bacterial cell. All the experiments were applied in triplicate tests at least. RESULTS: Although cell wall hydrophilicity was similar among Gram-negative bacteria, the distribution of negative charge on their cell surfaces was quite different. More negatively charged cell surfaces had a greater interaction with chitosan, a phenomenon further confirmed by transmission electron micrography (TEM). CONCLUSION: Results showed the hydrophilicity in Gram-negative bacteria was much higher than in Gram-positive ones. The correlation coefficient 0.988 between the amount of absorbed chitosan and its inhibition efficiency indicated a close relationship.
TI  - Phenoxazine compounds produced by the reactions with bovine hemoglobin show antimicrobial activity against non-tuberculosis mycobacteria.
AB  - We studied the anti-microbial effects of phenoxazines produced by the reaction of o-aminophenol or its derivatives with bovine hemoglobin, on seven species of mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium smegmatis and some bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogeneses. These phenoxazines, including 2-amino-4, 4alpha-dihydro-4alpha, 7-dimethyl-3H-phenoxzine-3-one (Phx-1), 3-amino-1, 4alpha-dihydro-4alpha, 8-dimethyl-2H-phenoxazine-2-one (Phx-2), and 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one (Phx-3), prevented the proliferation of four non-tuberculosis mycobacteria including M. scrofulaceum, M. kansasii, M. marinum, and M. intracellulare dose-dependently, though the inhibitory effects of these phenoxazines differed according to the species of mycobacteria. However these phenoxazines failed to prevent the proliferation of M. tuberculosis, M. fortuitum, and M. smegmatis, and the concerned bacteria other than mycobacteria. The present results may contribute to development of novel antibiotics against non-tuberculolsis mycobacteria.
TI  - Age influences resistance of Caenorhabditis elegans to killing by pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans has previously been proposed as an alternative host for models of infectious disease caused by human pathogens. When exposed to some human pathogenic bacteria, the life span of nematodes is significantly reduced. We have shown that mutations in the age-1, and/or age-2 genes of C. elegans, that normally enhance life expectancy, can also increase resistance to killing by the bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica var. Typhimurium, Burkholderia cepacia or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. We also found that the rate at which wild-type C. elegans was killed by the bacterial pathogens tested increased as nematodes aged. In the case of P. aeruginosa infection, the difference in life span of wild type and age-1 mutants of C. elegans was not due to differences in the level of bacterial colonisation of the gut.
TI  - Degradation of pulmonary surfactant protein D by Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase  abrogates innate immune function.
AB  - The alveolar epithelium is lined by surfactant, a lipoprotein complex that both reduces surface tension and mediates several innate immune functions including bacterial aggregation, alteration of alveolar macrophage function, and regulation of bacterial clearance. Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in several of these immune functions, and specifically it enhances the clearance of the pulmonary pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa secretes a variety of virulence factors including elastase, a zinc-metalloprotease, which degrades both SP-A and SP-D. Here we show that SP-D is cleaved by elastase to produce a stable 35-kDa fragment in a time-, temperature-, and dose-dependent manner. Degradation is inhibited by divalent metal cations, a metal chelator, and the elastase inhibitor, phosphoramidon. Sequencing the SP-D degradation products localized the major cleavage sites to the C-terminal lectin domain. The SP-D fragment fails to bind or aggregate bacteria that are aggregated by intact SP-D. SP-D fragment is observed when normal rat bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is treated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase, and SP-D fragments are present in the BAL of CF lung allograft patients. These data show that degradation of SP-D occurs in the BAL environment and that degradation eliminates many normal immune functions of SP-D.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Genome-wide cloning and characterization of microbial esterases.
AB  - We have isolated putative esterase genes from various bacterial chromosomes. Thirty open reading frames predicted to encode esterases were randomly selected from 13 sequenced bacterial chromosomes and were cloned into an expression vector. The esterase activity of the resulting clones was tested on a tributyrin plate at different pH values and temperatures. Nine out of thirty tested clones exhibited significant tributyrin hydrolyzing activity. The enzyme S5 from the gene b0494 of Escherichia coli, the enzyme S12 from the gene STM0506 of Salmonella typhimurium, and the enzyme S28 from the gene AF1716 of Archaeoglobus fulgidus exhibited high activity at an alkaline pH range. The esterase S11 encoded by the gene PA3859 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and the esterase S21 from the gene SMc01033 of Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, both showed a sharp increase in enzyme activity above pH 8.0. Furthermore, the enzymes S5, S12, S21, and S28 retained the esterase activity when they were incubated at 50 degrees C, suggesting that these enzymes are thermostable. Subsequent pH vs. activity and temperature vs. activity experiments with selected enzymes in a solution assay system confirmed the validity of the above data. The genome-wide exploration strategy of proteins provided valuable information on the esterases by revealing subtle biochemical differences between the esterases of different sources.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  - A water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against Escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. This 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (LMWC), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kDa, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. LMWC has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does LMWC. Accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against E. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of LMWC.
TI  - Inhibition of foodborne bacteria by the lactoperoxidase system in a beef cube system.
AB  - Biopreservatives are being developed to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens and thus improve food safety. The lactoperoxidase system (LPS) is a naturally occurring system that has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in foods. Growth of single strains of the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and beef microflora were assessed on LPS-treated meat surfaces in an experimental system. Beef cubes inoculated with approximately 10(4) cfu cm(-2) of bacteria were treated with the LPS and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h, 12 degrees C for 7 days or in a chilling regime: 12 to -1 degrees C over 1 week and held at -1 degrees C for 4 weeks. Treatment with LPS was more effective at storage temperatures non-permissive for rapid bacterial growth with strong inhibition of growth achieved on LPS-treated cubes at 12 degrees C and reduction in pathogen viable counts at chilling temperatures. At chilling temperatures, the LPS inhibited the growth of native pseudomonads but did not prevent the development of native lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - PmrAB, a two-component regulatory system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that modulates resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and addition of aminoarabinose to lipid A.
AB  - Spontaneous polymyxin-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated.  The mutations responsible for this phenotype were mapped to a two-component signal transduction system similar to PmrAB of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Lipid A of these mutants contained aminoarabinose, an inducible modification that is associated with polymyxin resistance. Thus, P. aeruginosa possesses a mechanism that induces resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides in response to environmental conditions.
TI  - Neutrophil serine proteinases cleave bacterial flagellin, abrogating its host response-inducing activity.
AB  - After bacterial infection, neutrophils dominate the cellular infiltrate. Their main function is assumed to be killing invading pathogens and resolving the inflammation they cause. Activated neutrophils are also known to release a variety of molecules, including the neutrophil serine proteinases, extracellularly. The release of these proteinases during inflammation creates a proteolytic environment where degradation of different molecules modulates the inflammatory response. Flagellin, the structural component of flagella on many bacterial species, is a virulence factor with a strong proinflammatory activity on epithelial cells and other cell types. In this study we show that both human and mouse neutrophil serine proteinases cleave flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacterial species. More important, cleavage of P. aeruginosa flagellin by the neutrophil serine proteinases neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G resulted in loss of the biological activity of this virulence factor, as evidenced by the lack of innate host defense gene expression in human epithelial cells. The finding that flagellin is susceptible to cleavage by neutrophil serine proteinases suggests a novel role for these enzymes in the inflammatory response to infection. Not only can these enzymes kill bacteria, but they also degrade their virulence factors to halt the inflammatory response they trigger.
TI  - Bacterial responses to neutrophil phagocytosis.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on adaptive bacterial interactions with neutrophils, emphasizing information communicated within the past year about bacterial factors that respond to contact with or phagocytosis by PMN. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the discovery of type III and IV secretion, progress in the analysis of bacterial interactions with host phagocytes has been extensive but largely focused on the macrophage. The remarkable growth of information about bacterial subversion of macrophage metabolism has been summarized in several excellent reviews. The scope of progress on neutrophil-bacteria interactions is more limited and dominated by recent studies of the granulocyte pathogen, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis. SUMMARY: For many pathogens, contact with or ingestion by phagocytes elicits a vigorous but varied microbial response. The response repertoire includes activation of type III and type IV secretion systems that inject effector molecules into the host cell. Effectors modify host cell signaling and metabolic pathways to favor survival of the microbe. Whereas microbial secretory structures are few in kind and relatively conserved, effector molecules are numerous and variable. Effectors may promote phagocytosis by nonphagocytic cells or suppress phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. They may suppress assembly or misdirect localization of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase that is responsible for generating toxic oxidants, and they may suppress phagosome-lysosome fusion. Phagocytosed bacteria may also up-regulate the expression of defensive proteins that attenuate the effects of phagocyte-derived antimicrobial toxins. These pathogenic stratagems probably have their origins in the competition among single-celled organisms, eukaryotes versus prokaryotes, that arose early in evolution.
TI  - PcrH of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is essential for secretion and assembly of the type III translocon.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbors a type III secretion system that translocates antihost effectors into an infected eukaryotic cell. PcrH is a key component of type III secretion in this essential virulence strategy. In the absence of PcrH, P. aeruginosa is translocation deficient because of a specific reduction in presecretory stability and subsequent secretion of PopB and PopD, 2 proteins essential for the translocation process. PcrH exerts this chaperone function by binding directly to PopB and PopD. Consistent with the genetic relatedness of PcrH with LcrH of pathogenic Yersinia species, these proteins are functionally interchangeable with respect to their ability to complement the translocation defect associated with either a lcrH or pcrH null mutant, respectively. Thus, the translocator class of chaperones performs a critical function in ensuring the assembly of a translocation competent type III secreton. Finally, unlike the regulatory roles of other translocator-class chaperones (e.g., LcrH, SicA of Salmonella enterica, and IpgC of Shigella species), in vitro regulation of P. aeruginosa type III secretion does not involve PcrH.
TI  - Viable cell detection by the combined use of fluorescent glucose and fluorescent  glycine.
AB  - The combined use of a fluorescent glucose (2NBDG) and a fluorescent glycine (NBD-Gly) was tried for the detection of viable cells of significant foodborne pathogenic strains in addition to several Escherichia coli strains and coliforms. Thirty-five out of 41 strains showed marked uptake of 2NBDG but 6 strains were not able to take in 2NBDG. Five out of these 6 strains showed NBD-Gly uptake.
TI  - Antimicrobial performance of alkaline ionic fluid (GC-100X) and its ability to remove Escherichia coli O157:H7 from the surface of tomatoes.
AB  - An efficacy test of GC-100X, a noncorrosive alkaline ionic fluid (pH 12) composed of free radicals and supplemented with xylitol, was carried out against six major foodborne pathogens-Staphylococcus aureus FRI 913, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 13076, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 Korean isolate, Vibrio parahaemolyticus ATCC 17803, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43894, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa KCTC 1637-at three different temperatures (4, 25, and 36 degrees C) with or without organic load (2% yeast extract). Results revealed a more than 4-log10 (CFU/ml) reduction (1.0 x 10(4) CFU/ml reduction) against all pathogens reacted at 37 degrees C for 3 h in the absence of organic material. GC-100X solution diluted with an equal volume of distilled or standard hard water (300 ppm CaCO3) showed effective bactericidal activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria. Washing efficacy of GC-100X solution was compared against E. coli O157:H7 on cherry tomato surfaces with those of a commercially used detergent and chlorine water (100 ppm). Viable cell counts of E. coli O157:H7 that had penetrated to the cores of tomatoes after sanitizing treatment revealed that GC-100X stock and its 5% diluted solutions had similar washing effects to 100-ppm chlorine water and were more effective than the other kitchen detergent. These results indicate that GC-100X has good bactericidal and sanitizing activities and is useful as a new sanitizer for food safety and kitchen hygiene.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of OXA-45, an extended-spectrum class  2d' beta-lactamase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - As part of the CANCER Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in North America, a clinical strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain 07-406, isolated in Texas was found to be resistant to all antimicrobials except polymyxin B. Genetic analysis of this isolate identified two unique extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. One, bla(VIM-7), encoded a metallo-beta-lactamase (unpublished data), and the other, bla(OXA-45), described here, encoded a class D extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. bla(OXA-45) was isolated on a Sau3A1 genomic fragment of 1.8 kb and encodes a protein of 264 amino acids with the highest identities to OXA-18 (65.9%), OXA-9 (42.8%), OXA-22 (40.2%), OXA-12 (38.6%), and OXA-29 (35.2%) but weak identities with other class D beta-lactamases. bla(OXA-45) was found to be harbored on a 24-kb plasmid in a region that displays high identities with a section of the 43-kb genomic island of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104. Biochemically OXA-45 is most similar to OXA-18 in its substrate profile and inhibition by clavulanic acid and is a member of the 2d' class of beta-lactamases.
TI  - Sensitization of outer-membrane mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to antimicrobial peptides under high pressure.
AB  - High pressure can sensitize gram-negative bacteria to antimicrobial peptides or proteins through the permeabilization of their outer membranes; however, the range of compounds to which sensitivity is induced is species and strain dependent. We studied the role of outer-membrane properties in this sensitization by making use of a series of rough and deep rough mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that show an increased degree of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) truncation, along with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhoP and PhoQ mutants with altered outer-membrane properties. The outer-membrane properties of P. aernginosa were also modulated through the use of different Mg2- concentrations in the growth medium. Each of these strains was challenged under high pressure (15 min at 270 MPa for Salmonella Typhimurium and 15 min at 100 MPa for P. aerttginosa) in phosphate buffer with lysozyme (100 microg/ml), nisin (100 IU/ml), lactoferricin (20 microg/ml), and HEL96-116 (100 microg/ml), a synthetic lysozyme-derived peptide, and sensitization levels were compared. The results obtained indicated that outer-membrane properties affected high-pressure sensitization differently for different compounds. LPS truncation in Salmonella Typhimurium was correlated with increased sensitization to lysozyme (up to 1.5 log10 units) and nisin (up to 1.2 log10 units) but with decreased sensitization to lactoferricin under pressure. For P. aeruginosa, the pattern of sensitization to lactoferricin and nisin resembled that of polymyxin B at atmospheric pressure, suggesting that pressure induces the self-promoted uptake of both peptides. Sensitization to HEL96-116 was not affected by outer-membrane properties for either organism. Hence, outer-membrane permeabilization by high pressure cannot be explained by a single unifying mechanism and is dependent on the organism, the outer-membrane properties, and the nature of the antimicrobial compound. On the basis of these findings, the use of antimicrobial cocktails targeting different bacteria and fractions of bacterial populations may enhance the efficacy of high pressure as a preservation treatment.
TI  - Composition, acquisition, and distribution of the Vi exopolysaccharide-encoding Salmonella enterica pathogenicity island SPI-7.
AB  - Vi capsular polysaccharide production is encoded by the viaB locus, which has a limited distribution in Salmonella enterica serovars. In S. enterica serovar Typhi, viaB is encoded on a 134-kb pathogenicity island known as SPI-7 that is located between partially duplicated tRNA(pheU) sites. Functional and bioinformatic analysis suggests that SPI-7 has a mosaic structure and may have evolved as a consequence of several independent insertion events. Analysis of viaB-associated DNA in Vi-positive S. enterica serovar Paratyphi C and S. enterica serovar Dublin isolates revealed the presence of similar SPI-7 islands. In S. enterica serovars Paratyphi C and Dublin, the SopE bacteriophage and a 15-kb fragment adjacent to the intact tRNA(pheU) site were absent. In S. enterica serovar Paratyphi C only, a region encoding a type IV pilus involved in the adherence of S. enterica serovar Typhi to host cells was missing. The remainder of the SPI-7 islands investigated exhibited over 99% DNA sequence identity in the three serovars. Of 30 other Salmonella serovars examined, 24 contained no insertions at the equivalent tRNA(pheU) site, 2 had a 3.7-kb insertion, and 4 showed sequence variation at the tRNA(pheU)-phoN junction, which was not analyzed further. Sequence analysis of the SPI-7 region from S. enterica serovar Typhi strain CT18 revealed significant synteny with clusters of genes from a variety of saprophytic bacteria and phytobacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri. This analysis suggested that SPI-7 may be a mobile element, such as a conjugative transposon or an integrated plasmid remnant.
TI  - Duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. Here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. Using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. RESULTS: It is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. Furthermore, the GC3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. CONCLUSIONS: The results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. The importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. Therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.
TI  - The role of mutators in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that maintain genome stability. However, strains exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS predominating. MMR-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator hosts. MMR is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. Removal of this barrier, as in the case of MMR defective mutators, also enhances the frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of acquired drug resistance in bacteria. Permanent global mutator status is associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations more frequently than non-mutators. Fitness limitations of mutators may be overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. Mutators are a risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance determinants.
TI  - Structural study of binding of flagellin by Toll-like receptor 5.
AB  - In order to predict the binding regions within the complex formed by Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR-5) and flagellin, a complementary hydropathy between the two proteins was sought. A region common to the flagellins of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes was shown to be hydropathically complementary to the 552-to-561 fragment of TLR-5, whose sequence is EILDISRNQL. The hydrophobicity profile of this region is shared with flagellins of 377 bacterial species out of a total of 723 publicly available sequences. A conformational analysis of the predicted binding site of TLR-5, whose structure is still unknown, was carried out with a methodology already applied to similar problems. To sample the conformations available to the peptide chain, a plot of the number of conformations per unit energy interval (density of states) versus energy was built. Following a theoretical argument, conformations belonging to maxima in this plot were selected. The most stable structure obtained in this search, an alpha-helical conformation, was shown to form the electrostatic interactions Glu552-Gln89, Asp555-Arg92, and Arg558-Glu93 with the predicted binding site of the flagellin of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, formed by the 88-to-97 chain fragment (LQRVRELAVQ), which is likewise alpha helical.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Capsicum extract against Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculated in raw beef meat.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of the extract of Capsicum annuum bell pepper type was evaluated against Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, inoculated in minced beef meat mixed with different concentrations of the extract, and stored at 7 degrees C for 7 days. The combined effect of C. annuum extract and sodium chloride on the bacterial growth was evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the extract to prevent the growth of S. typhimurium in minced beef was 1.5 ml/100 g of meat; the addition of 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% w/w of sodium chloride did not have any additional inhibitory effect on Salmonella. In the case of P. aeruginosa, a concentration of 0.3 ml of the extract/100 g of meat showed a bacteriostatic effect, while a concentration of 3 ml/100 g of meat showed a bactericidal effect. When 1% w/w of sodium chloride was added to the meat together with the extract, the concentration needed to kill P. aeruginosa was reduced.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiprotozoal and antioxidant activity of five plants used in Izabal for infectious diseases.
AB  - Methanol and aqueous extracts from fi ve plant species, used in traditional medicine in Guatemala for the treatment of microbial infections, were tested in vitro for their ability to scavenge DPPH, OH(.) and O(2) (-) radicals and to inhibit lipoperoxidation (LPO) in order to establish a relationship between their antioxidant activities and their effects against infectious agents. Acalypha guatemalensis, Ocimum micranthum and Smilax spinosa possessed a significant activity against both the three free radicals assayed and LPO; Guazuma ulmifolia showed effects against DPPH and OH(.). Piper auritum showed no activity. These extracts were also evaluated for antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities. A. guatemalensis showed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; S. spinosa was active against Salmonella typhi, and A. guatemalensis, and S. spinosa against Trypanosoma cruzi or Leishmania spp.
TI  - Electrophoretic analysis of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria.
AB  - A comparative study involving SDS-PAGE of Salmonella typhi and other Bacteria was conducted. Protoplasmic antigens of Salmonella typhi. Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus sp, Klebsiellas sp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus were separated and compared on SDS-PAGE followed by checking of their cross reactivity by gel diffusion using antisera raised against whole cell and lysates of Salmonella typhi. Lines of identity between Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A and Salmonella typhimurium were observed. No lines of identity were seen among Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Sfaphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Synergistic effect of ayurvedic pearl preparation on enhancing effectiveness of antibiotics.
AB  - Studies were carried out with ayurvedic preparations derived from pearl, which include preparations bhasma and pishti. The synergistic effect to reduce the dose of antibiotic was tested against E. coli the test bacterium with ampicillin antibiotic by bore well and disks diffusion methods. It was observed that pearl preparations do not show any antibacterial activity but when used at 200 microg/ml concentration with antibiotics, then even at sub-lethal dose, the antibiotic has effectively shown the results with reduced contact time. The protocol was also tested with the other bacteria like, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vibrio cholarae, Salmonella typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus and has shown similar results. The pearl bhasma synergistic effect was also tested with other antibiotics such as erythromycin, kanamycin, and ampicillin.
TI  - Eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  - This study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. The electrophoretic profile of SDS-PAGE showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. Three bacteria species, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/mL). On the other hand, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. The present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from different bacterial sources elicit disparate cytokine responses in whole blood assays.
AB  - The stimulatory effects of different purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations from E. coli, S. typhosa, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae on cytokine and chemokine production were measured in whole blood assays by ELISA. Incubation of 0.5 ml whole blood with 10 ng/ml E. coli and S. typhosa resulted in a time-dependent production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, IL-10 and MCP-1. K. pneumoniae, however, showed preferential effects on IL-1beta, IL-10 and MCP-1 production with less potent effects on TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. LPS derived from P. aeruginosa showed a similar potency to other LPS preparations on MCP-1 production, yet completely failed to elicit the production of other cytokines. To further investigate potencies of the different LPS preparations, mediator production was determined following stimulation with agonist concentrations of 0.1 ng and 1000 ng per ml over a 24 h time period. Dose-response curves were obtained with LPS derived from E. coli, S. typhosa and K. pneumoniae on all mediators apart from IL-1beta and MCP-1. Most strikingly though, was the ability of LPS derived from P. aeruginosa to selectively elicit a significant dose-response effect on MCP-1 production, despite its very weak stimulatory effects on all other cytokines. These data imply that the bacterial origin of different LPS preparations can exhibit disparate effects on inflammatory mediator production. Furthermore, the potent, selective dose-response effect of P. aeruginosa LPS on MCP-1 production could help to explain the preponderance of a relentless inflammatory cellular infiltrate in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF).
TI  - The Salmonella enterica subspecies I specific centisome 7 genomic island encodes  novel protein families present in bacteria living in close contact with eukaryotic cells.
AB  - We have determined the genetic structure of the Salmonella enterica centisome 7 genomic island (SCI) located at the aspV loci in S. enterica subspecies I strains. The 47-kb long genomic island encodes 37 putative proteins, including the previously described saf fimbrial operon and the sinR transcriptional regulator. Other open reading frames (designated sci A to Z) in the island encode putative proteins with homologies to virulence-associated proteins in a number of gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pestis and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, bacteria that have the ability to interact with and manipulate eukaryotic cells. The Sci proteins have putative cytoplasmic, periplasmic and outer membrane localizations pointing to a role in extracellular processes such as secretion or organelle biosynthesis. The genes encoding Sci-like proteins are clustered in all sequenced bacterial genomes available in the databases and a core set can be defined by the presence of genes encoding proteins with similarity to the SciB, C, G, H, I, O proteins. The SCI genomic island DNA sequences are restricted to Salmonella strains belonging to S. enterica subspecies I and deletion of the entire island affects the ability of the organisms to enter eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Molecular characterization of SPM-1, a novel metallo-beta-lactamase isolated in Latin America: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  - The gene encoding the metallo-beta-lactamase SPM-1 was cloned from a genomic library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 48-1997 A. The insert carrying spm-1 possessed a GC content of 47%, indicating that it is of non-Pseudomonas origin. Upstream of spm-1 there is a small open reading frame (ORF), which is homologous to the LysR family of proteins (69% identity to the LysR protein from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Downstream of spm-1 there is the start of an ORF, the product of which shows close homology with the GroEL-type proteins from Xanthomonas campestris. No transmissible element could be identified upstream or downstream of spm-1. The spm-1 gene is carried on a plasmid that can transform both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime resistance. SPM-1 contains the classic metallo-beta-lactamase zinc-binding motif HXHXD and shows the highest identity (35.5%) to IMP-1. SPM-1 is a distinctly different metallo-beta-lactamase from VIM and IMP and, accordingly, represents a new subfamily of mobile metallo-beta-lactamases. The predicted molecular weight of the protein was 27 515 Da, significantly higher than that of IMP (25 041 Da) or VIM (25 322 Da). SPM-1 possesses a unique loop of 23 residues that accounts for the higher molecular mass.
TI  - Characterization of serracin P, a phage-tail-like bacteriocin, and its activity against Erwinia amylovora, the fire blight pathogen.
AB  - Serratia plymithicum J7 culture supernatant displayed activity against many pathogenic strains of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of the most serious bacterial disease of apple and pear trees, fire blight, and against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. This activity increased significantly upon induction with mitomycin C. A phage-tail-like bacteriocin, named serracin P, was purified from an induced culture supernatant of S. plymithicum J7. It was found to be the only compound involved in the antibacterial activity against sensitive strains. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the two major subunits (23 and 43 kDa) of serracin P revealed high homology with the Fels-2 prophage of Salmonella enterica, the coliphages P2 and 168, the phiCTX prophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a prophage of Yersinia pestis. This strongly suggests a common ancestry for serracin P and these bacteriophages.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of disinfectants against some gramnegative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of 11 new commercially manufactured disinfectants on clinical isolates of Salmonella typhimurium DT104, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. The substances tested represented six pure quaternary ammonium substances (QAS) and five QAS combined with other ingredients. The antibacterial efficacy was characterized by influencing the growth of bacterial cells expressed by MIC and ED50 values. The disinfectants are divided into three groups according to their efficacy. The antibacterial efficacy of disinfectants on S. typhimurium DT104 in the study is the highest in comparison with S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa strains. The highest inhibition of growth was caused by Diesen forte on S. typhimurium DT 104 and by Benzalkonium chloride on both S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa strains.
TI  - Multidrug pump inhibitors uncover remarkable activity of plant antimicrobials.
AB  - Plant antimicrobials are not used as systemic antibiotics at present. The main reason for this is their low level of activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria. The reported MIC is often in the range of 100 to 1,000 micro g/ml, orders of magnitude higher than those of common broad-spectrum antibiotics from bacteria or fungi. Major plant pathogens belong to the gram-negative bacteria, which makes the low level of activity of plant antimicrobials against this group of microorganisms puzzling. Gram-negative bacteria have an effective permeability barrier, comprised of the outer membrane, which restricts the penetration of amphipathic compounds, and multidrug resistance pumps (MDRs), which extrude toxins across this barrier. It is possible that the apparent ineffectiveness of plant antimicrobials is largely due to the permeability barrier. We tested this hypothesis in the present study by applying a combination of MDR mutants and MDR inhibitors. A panel of plant antimicrobials was tested by using a set of bacteria representing the main groups of plant pathogens. The human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were also tested. The results show that the activities of the majority of plant antimicrobials were considerably greater against the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus megaterium and that disabling of the MDRs in gram-negative species leads to a striking increase in antimicrobial activity. Thus, the activity of rhein, the principal antimicrobial from rhubarb, was potentiated 100- to 2,000-fold (depending on the bacterial species) by disabling the MDRs. Comparable potentiation of activity was observed with plumbagin, resveratrol, gossypol, coumestrol, and berberine. Direct measurement of the uptake of berberine, a model plant antimicrobial, confirmed that disabling of the MDRs strongly increases the level of penetration of berberine into the cells of gram-negative bacteria. These results suggest that plants might have developed means of delivering their antimicrobials into bacterial cells. These findings also suggest that plant antimicrobials might be developed into effective, broad-spectrum antibiotics in combination with inhibitors of MDRs.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. Recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill C. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. We examined C. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. We demonstrate that S. pyogenes kills C. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. Unlike P. aeruginosa and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the killing by S. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. Killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. Major exotoxins of S. pyogenes are not involved in the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout mutants. Moreover, no accumulation of S. pyogenes in C. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. Preliminary results show that S. pneumoniae can also kill C. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. Hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill C. elegans.
TI  - Screening of some Siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 Siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. Of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. The most active antimicrobial plants were Bergenia crassifolia, Chelidonium majus, Rhaponticum carthamoides, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Tussilago farfara.
TI  - Inorganic polyphosphate is essential for long-term survival and virulence factors in Shigella and Salmonella spp.
AB  - The importance of inorganic polyphosphate (poly P) and poly P kinase (PPK), the enzyme principally responsible for its synthesis, has been established previously for stationary-phase survival of Escherichia coli and virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The gene (ppk) that encodes PPK is highly conserved among many bacterial pathogens, including Shigella and Salmonella spp. In view of the phylogenetic similarity of the enteropathogens and the frequency with which virulence factors are expressed in stationary phase, the ppk gene of pathogenic Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin, and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium have been cloned and deleted. In some of these mutants lacking ppk, the phenotypes included features indicative of decreased virulence such as: (i) growth defects, (ii) defective responses to stress and starvation, (iii) loss of viability, (iv) polymyxin sensitivity, (v) intolerance to acid and heat, and (vi) diminished invasiveness in epithelial cells. Thus PPK may prove, as it has with P. aeruginosa, to be an attractive target for antibiotics, with low toxicity because PPK is not found in higher eukaryotes.
TI  - Various bacterial pathogens and symbionts infect the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.
AB  - The haploid soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a suitable model organism to  study host-pathogen interactions with Legionella pneumophila. In this study we show that D. discoideum AX2 is also susceptible to infection with other important human pathogens and obligate intracellular symbionts. Infection assays demonstrated that Legionella-like amoebal pathogens (LLAP K62), Mycobacterium avium and the obligate intracellular endosymbionts of Acanthamoeba sp. strains TUME1, UWE25 and UWC6 were able to multiply within Dictyostelium. Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa also invaded Dictyostelium, however were degraded shortly after uptake. Comitin-minus host cells were more permissive to infections with L. pneumophila and LLAP K62. Furthermore, this mutation significantly delayed the degradation of S. typhimurium. Accompanying electron and fluorescence microscopy of infected AX2 cells revealed that L. pneumophila and M. avium replicate within vacuoles, while LLAP K62, TUME1 and UWE25 were tightly enclosed by membranous structures within the cytoplasm. The beta-proteobacterium UWC6 was found to persist in the cytoplasm. The observed subcellular locations which correspond to the locations within the respective natural hosts suggest that D. discoideum is a representative model system for these pathogens and symbionts.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Harungana madagascariensis leaf extracts.
AB  - Aqueous extracts of the leaf of Harungana madagascariensis were analysed phytochemically and evaluated for antimicrobial activity against strains of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Glycosides, tannins, saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids were detected in the plant material. B. subtilis, E. coli and S. typhi, but not Ps. aeruginosa, showed susceptibility at MICs of 2.0 and 15.6 mg/mL; and MBCs of 2.0-3.9 mg/mL and 15.6-31.3 mg/mL, respectively, for the cold and hot extracts. Staph. aureus showed susceptibility only to the hot extract. Concentrations of 2.5-10.0 mg/mL of the cold extract killed over 7 log(10) of the test bacterial population within 30-60 min of exposure. The hot extract needed higher concentrations and longer treatment to achieve similar levels of bacterial cell killing. The results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of H. madagascariensis leaf extracts for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Determination of growth rate of microorganisms in broth from oxygen-sensitive fluorescence plate reader measurements.
AB  - A novel method utilizing the BD Oxygen Biosensor System has been developed to rapidly, simply, and accurately determine the growth rate of microorganisms in broth, with no needfor plate counts, standardized inocula, or technically difficult manipulations. The BD Oxygen Biosensor System incorporates an oxygen-sensitive material into the wells of standard Falcon microplates. The time response of this sensor monitored in afluorescence plate reader can be used to quantitate microbe growth. The method entails seeding a dilution series of microorganism onto the plate and reading at regular intervals for 3-10 h. As the organisms grow and consume oxygen, thefluorescence intensities increase over time to form a family of sigmoidal growth curves. A simple mathematical analysis of the time intervals between the curves yields the doubling time, which is independent of the initial concentration of organism. The method is ideally suited as a screening tool for assessing the impact of culture conditions, media composition, or added compounds on growth kinetics.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - Immunization of mice against Salmonella typhimurium using different DNA preparations.
AB  - Groups of female BALB/c mice were given primary and booster injections of whole genomic DNA extracted from S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, or S. aureus. Other groups of mice were immunized in a similar manner with the 1.57kb fragment of the mouse virulence gene (mviA), pTargeT vector (plasmid DNA)/1.57kb construct, pTargeT vector, or saline. Mice in all groups were challenged intraperitoneally with 100 LD50 of S. typhimurium. The bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using the Pure Gene extraction kit. Specific primers were used to amplify the 1.57kb fragment by PCR. The pTargeT Mammalian Expression Vector System was used to prepare the plasmid/ 1.57kb construct. Bacterial genomic DNA extracted from P. aeruginosa and S. aureus appeared to induce non-specific resistance in mice. Specific, in addition to non-specific resistance appeared to be induced when genomic DNA from S. typhimurium was used. There was a prolongation of survival in the groups of mice that received either the 1.57kb fragment or the pTargeT vector/1.57kb construct and 16.67% and 33.34% respectively, of mice in each group survived at 40 days post challenge. None of the mice in the saline control group survived by day 7 post challenge. It is suggested that the non-specific resistance observed in this study might have been due to the adjuvant effect of the non-methylated CpG and other immunostimulatory motifs in bacterial DNA. Specific resistance obtained when genomic DNA from S. typhimurium was used might have been due to minute antigenic contamination, or virulence factor genes other than the mviA gene, might have been expressed in the host, which induced specific immunity.
TI  - Crystal structure of the Yersinia pestis GTPase activator YopE.
AB  - Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, evades the immune response of the infected organism by using a type III (contact-dependent) secretion system to deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of mammalian cells, where they interfere with signaling pathways that regulate inflammation and cytoskeleton dynamics. The cytotoxic effector YopE functions as a potent GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTP-binding proteins, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Down-regulation of these molecular switches results in the loss of cell motility and inhibition of phagocytosis, enabling Y. pestis to thrive on the surface of macrophages. We have determined the crystal structure of the GAP domain of YopE (YopE(GAP); residues 90-219) at 2.2-A resolution. Apart from the fact that it is composed almost entirely of alpha-helices, YopE(GAP) shows no obvious structural similarity with eukaryotic RhoGAP domains. Moreover, unlike the catalytically equivalent arginine fingers of the eukaryotic GAPs, which are invariably contained within flexible loops, the critical arginine in YopE(GAP) (Arg144) is part of an alpha-helix. The structure of YopE(GAP) is strikingly similar to the GAP domains from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ExoS(GAP)) and Salmonella enterica (SptP(GAP)), despite the fact that the three amino acid sequences are not highly conserved. A comparison of the YopE(GAP) structure with those of the Rac1-ExoS(GAP) and Rac1-SptP complexes indicates that few, if any, significant conformational changes occur in YopE(GAP) when it interacts with its G protein targets. The structure of YopE(GAP) may provide an avenue for the development of novel therapeutic agents to combat plague.
TI  - Epithelial cell contact-induced alterations in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi  lipopolysaccharide are critical for bacterial internalization.
AB  - The invasion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi into epithelial cells depends on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein as an epithelial receptor. In the case of P. aeruginosa, the bacterial ligand for CFTR is the outer core oligosaccharide portion of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To determine whether serovar Typhi LPS is also a bacterial ligand mediating internalization, we used both P. aeruginosa and serovar Typhi LPS as a competitive inhibitor of serovar Typhi invasion into the epithelial cell line T84. P. aeruginosa LPS containing a complete core efficiently inhibited serovar Typhi invasion. However, neither killed wild-type Typhi cells nor purified LPS were effective inhibitors. LPS from mutant Typhi strains defective in O side-chain synthesis, but with an apparently normal core, was capable of inhibiting invasion, but LPS obtained from a deeper rough mutant strain with alterations in fast-migrating core oligosaccharide failed to inhibit invasion. Lastly, exposure of wild-type serovar Typhi to T84 cultures before heat killing resulted in a structural alteration in its LPS that allowed the heat-killed cells to inhibit invasion of wild-type serovar Typhi. These data indicate that the serovar Typhi LPS core, like the P. aeruginosa LPS core, is a ligand mediating internalization of bacteria by epithelial cells, and that exposure of this ligand on wild-type Typhi is induced by the bacteria's interaction with host cells.
TI  - PCR detection of Salmonella typhimurium in pharmaceutical raw materials and products contaminated with a mixed bacterial culture using the BAX system.
AB  - The BAX system, a PCR-based assay, was evaluated for detecting Salmonella typhimurium in pharmaceutical raw materials and products contaminated with mixed bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Artificially contaminated samples were preenriched in lactose broth with and without Tween 20. After preenrichment, samples were analyzed by PCR and standard methods. Ten of 25 samples did not show presence of the specific Salmonella spp. 740-base pair DNA fragment. However, S. typhimurium was isolated and identified by standard methods from all 25 samples. To optimize S. typhimurium detection in PCR negative samples, lactose broth was replaced by buffered peptone water (BPW) as the preenrichment broth. When BPW was used, all 10 samples were PCR positive. BPW enrichments increased S. typhimurium growth resulting in rapid PCR detection. The presence of non-Salmonella bacteria influenced the performance of the PCR-based assay. Optimization of S. typhimurium PCR detection in mixed culture required the use of different preenrichment broths. However, the BAX system detected S. typhimurium within 27 hours while standard methods required 5-7 days.
TI  - Family of class 1 integrons related to In4 from Tn1696.
AB  - The class 1 integron In28, found in the multidrug resistance transposon Tn1403, was found to be located in the res site of the backbone transposon and is flanked by a 5-bp direct duplication, indicating that it reached this position by transposition. In28 has a backbone structure related to that of In4, but has lost internal sequences, including the sul1 gene, due to an IS6100-mediated deletion. In28 also lacks the partial copy of IS6100 found in In4 and contains different gene cassettes, blaP1, cmlA1, and aadA1. In1, the class 1 integron found in the multidrug resistance plasmid R46, is also located in a putative res site and belongs to the In4 group. In1 has a shorter internal deletion than In28 and has also lost one end. Additional integrons with structures related to In4 were also found in databases, and most of them had also lost either one end or internal regions or both. Tn610 belongs to this group.
TI  - Molecular mechanisms of bacteria induced apoptosis.
AB  - Interaction of mammalian cells with pathogenic bacteria results in a whole variety of responses in the infected cells including internalization or phagocytosis of the bacterium, release of cytokines, secretion of defensins or production of oxygen radicals. However, recent studies pointed out that many bacteria are able to trigger apoptosis in the host cell. The induction of apoptosis upon infection results from a complex interaction of bacterial proteins with cellular proteins finally mediating apoptosis. Thus, bacteria are able to activate several pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. caspases, to inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. NF(kappa)B or MAP-kinases, or to upregulate endogenous receptor/ligand systems, that induce apoptosis, on the surface of the infected cell. Host cell apoptosis very often serves the bacteria to attack the host and to gain access to the tissue. However, in some infections, apoptosis of mammalian cells significantly contributes to the host defense against the bacteria further indicating the role of apoptosis in host-pathogen interactions.
TI  - Temperature shock, injury and transient sensitivity to nisin in Gram negatives.
AB  - AIMS: The effect of thermal stresses on survival, injury and nisin sensitivity was investigated in Salmonella Enteritidis PT4, PT7 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS AND RESULTS: Heating at 55 degrees C, rapid chilling to 0.5 degrees C or freezing at -20 degrees C produced transient sensitivity to nisin. Cells were only sensitive if nisin was present during stress. Resistance recovered rapidly afterwards, though some cells displayed residual injury. Injury was assessed by SDS sensitivity, hydrophobicity changes, lipopolysaccharide release and NPN uptake. LPS release and hydrophobicity were not always associated with transient nisin sensitivity. Uptake of NPN correlated better but persisted longer after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Thermal shocks produce transient injury to the outer membrane, allowing nisin access. After treatment, the permeability barrier is rapidly restored by a process apparently involving reorganization rather than biosynthetic repair. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Inclusion of nisin during food treatments that impose sub-lethal stress on Gram negatives could increase process lethality, enhancing microbiological safety and stability.
TI  - An inner membrane enzyme in Salmonella and Escherichia coli that transfers 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose to lipid A: induction on polymyxin-resistant mutants and role of a novel lipid-linked donor.
AB  - Attachment of the cationic sugar 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) to lipid A is required for the maintenance of polymyxin resistance in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The enzymes that synthesize l-Ara4N and transfer it to lipid A have not been identified. We now report an inner membrane enzyme, expressed in polymyxin-resistant mutants, that adds one or two l-Ara4N moieties to lipid A or its immediate precursors. No soluble factors are required. A gene located near minute 51 on the S. typhimurium and E. coli chromosomes (previously termed orf5, pmrK, or yfbI) encodes the l-Ara4N transferase. The enzyme, renamed ArnT, consists of 548 amino acid residues in S. typhimurium with 12 possible membrane-spanning regions. ArnT displays distant similarity to yeast protein mannosyltransferases. ArnT adds two l-Ara4N units to lipid A precursors containing a Kdo disaccharide. However, as shown by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, it transfers only a single l-Ara4N residue to the 1-phosphate moiety of lipid IV(A), a precursor lacking Kdo. Proteins with full-length sequence similarity to ArnT are present in genomes of other bacteria thought to synthesize l-Ara4N-modified lipid A, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Yersinia pestis. As shown in the following article (Trent, M. S., Ribeiro, A. A., Doerrler, W. T., Lin, S., Cotter, R. J., and Raetz, C. R. H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 43132-43144), ArnT utilizes the novel lipid undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-l-Ara4N as its sugar donor, suggesting that l-Ara4N transfer to lipid A occurs on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane.
TI  - The emerging periplasm-localized subclass of AroQ chorismate mutases, exemplified by those from Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chorismate mutases of the AroQ homology class are widespread in the Bacteria and the Archaea. Many of these exist as domains that are fused with other aromatic-pathway catalytic domains. Among the monofunctional AroQ proteins, that from Erwinia herbicola was previously shown to have a cleavable signal peptide and located in the periplasmic compartment. Whether or not this might be unique to E. herbicola was unknown. RESULTS: The gene coding for the AroQ protein was cloned from Salmonella typhimurium, and the AroQ protein purified from both S. typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to have a periplasmic location. The periplasmic chorismate mutases (denoted *AroQ) are shown to be a distinct subclass of AroQ, being about twice the size of cytoplasmic AroQ proteins. The increased size is due to a carboxy-terminal extension of unknown function. In addition, a so-far novel aromatic aminotransferase was shown to be present in the periplasm of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis has detected a number of additional *aroQ genes. The joint presence of *AroQ, cyclohexadienyl dehydratase and aromatic aminotransferase in the periplasmic compartment of P. aeruginosa comprises a complete chorismate-to-phenylalanine pathway and accounts for the "hidden overflow pathway" to phenylalanine described previously.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - Protective effect of OK-432 on mice against endotoxemia and infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - OK-432 has been used clinically as a biological response modifier for cancer therapy. We investigated here the protective effects of OK-432 against endotoxic shock and infectious death caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enteritidis in mice and proposed a possible mechanism. Pretreatment of OK-432 reduced the lethality of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock in D-(+)-galactosamine-sensitized C3H/HeN mice. OK-432 did not affect the TNFalpha production in blood, but it did decrease the susceptibility to TNFalpha. Furthermore, an acceleration of LPS clearance from blood was detected. The pretreatment of OK-432 also decreased the lethality of mice in bacterial infection caused by P. aeruginosa and S. enteritidis. The rapid decrease of the viable bacteria from the circulating blood and in spleen and liver in mice was observed in a manner similar to LPS clearance. These findings indicate that the protective effect of OK-432 against the endotoxemia and bacteremia may depend on an up-regulation of clearance of LPS and bacteria and the augmented resistance to TNFalpha.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Molecular diagnosis of microbial contamination in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products: a review.
AB  - Molecular methodologies such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence and  polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays provide rapid quality control analysis of cosmetic and pharmaceutical finished products and raw materials. Using a single enrichment broth for bacteria, yeast, and mold, ATP bioluminescence detected microbial contamination within 27 h. Samples were automatically lysed to release microbial ATP and light production was quantitated using the Celsis Optocomp. However, to maintain the detection time to within 27 h, different enrichment broths were required for neutralization of antimicrobial ingredients in finished products and to provide specific nutrients for growth optimization. To perform the PCR reaction, bacterial DNA was extracted using a Tris-EDTA-Tween 20-proteinase K buffer at 35 degrees C while yeast and mold DNA were extracted using a Tris-EDTA-SDS buffer at 95 degrees C. Extracted microbial DNA was added to Ready-To-Go PCR beads and specific DNA primers. The primers were targeted to amplify specific regions within Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Burkholderia cepacia, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Furthermore, conserved bacterial ribosomal DNA sequences have also been used for sterility testing of samples. The results from these studies indicate that both ATP bioluminescence and PCR assays provide rapid, reliable, and cost effective methods for quality evaluation. This will ultimately result in faster product release and production optimization.
TI  - Identification and functional characterization of arylamine N-acetyltransferases  in eubacteria: evidence for highly selective acetylation of 5-aminosalicylic acid.
AB  - Arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity has been described in various bacterial species. Bacterial N-acetyltransferases, including those from bacteria of the gut flora, may be involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, thereby exerting physiopathological effects. We characterized these enzymes further by steady-state kinetics, time-dependent inhibition, and DNA hybridization in 40 species, mostly from the human intestinal microflora. We report for the first time N-acetyltransferase activity in 11 species of Proteobacteriaceae from seven genera: Citrobacter amalonaticus, Citrobacter farmeri, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella ozaenae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Shigella flexneri, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Vibrio cholerae. We estimated apparent kinetic parameters and found that 5-aminosalicylic acid, a compound efficient in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, was acetylated with a catalytic efficiency 27 to 645 times higher than that for its isomer, 4-aminosalicylic acid. In contrast, para-aminobenzoic acid, a folate precursor in bacteria, was poorly acetylated. Of the wild-type strains studied, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the best acetylator in terms of both substrate spectrum and catalytic efficiency. DNA hybridization with a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-derived probe suggested the presence of this enzyme in eight proteobacterial and four gram-positive species. Molecular aspects together with the kinetic data suggest distinct functional features for this class of microbial enzymes.
TI  - The efficacy of a Salmonella typhi Vi conjugate vaccine in two-to-five-year-old children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. The licensed typhoid vaccines confer only about 70 percent immunity, do not protect young children, and are not used for routine vaccination. A newly devised conjugate of the capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi, Vi, bound to nontoxic recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (rEPA), has enhanced immunogenicity in adults and in children 5 to 14 years old and has elicited a booster response in children 2 to 4 years old. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized trial, we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the Vi-rEPA vaccine in children two to five years old in 16 communes in Dong Thap Province, Vietnam. Each of the 11,091 children received two injections six weeks apart of either Vi-rEPA or a saline placebo. Cases of typhoid, diagnosed by the isolation of S. typhi from blood cultures after 3 or more days of fever (a temperature of 37.5 degrees C or higher), were identified by active surveillance over a period of 27 months. We estimated efficacy by comparing the attack rate of typhoid in the vaccine group with that in the placebo group. RESULTS: S. typhi was isolated from 4 of the 5525 children who were fully vaccinated with Vi-rEPA and from 47 of the 5566 children who received both injections of placebo (efficacy, 91.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 77.1 to 96.6; P<0.001). Among the 771 children who received only one injection, there was 1 case of typhoid in the vaccine group and 8 cases in the placebo group. Cases were distributed evenly among all age groups and throughout the study period. No serious adverse reactions were observed. In all 36 children studied four weeks after the second injection of the vaccine, levels of serum IgG Vi antibodies had increased by a factor of 10 or more. CONCLUSIONS: The Vi-rEPA conjugate typhoid vaccine is safe and immunogenic and has more than 90 percent efficacy in children two to five years old. The antibody responses and the efficacy suggest that this vaccine should be at least as protective in persons who are more than five years old.
TI  - Bap, a Staphylococcus aureus surface protein involved in biofilm formation.
AB  - Identification of new genes involved in biofilm formation is needed to understand the molecular basis of strain variation and the pathogenic mechanisms implicated in chronic staphylococcal infections. A biofilm-producing Staphylococcus aureus isolate was used to generate biofilm-negative transposon (Tn917) insertion mutants. Two mutants were found with a significant decrease in attachment to inert surfaces (early adherence), intercellular adhesion, and biofilm formation. The transposon was inserted at the same locus in both mutants. This locus (bap [for biofilm associated protein]) encodes a novel cell wall associated protein of 2,276 amino acids (Bap), which shows global organizational similarities to surface proteins of gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi) and gram-positive (Enteroccocus faecalis) microorganisms. Bap's core region represents 52% of the protein and consists of 13 successive nearly identical repeats, each containing 86 amino acids. bap was present in a small fraction of bovine mastitis isolates (5% of the 350 S. aureus isolates tested), but it was absent from the 75 clinical human S. aureus isolates analyzed. All staphylococcal isolates harboring bap were highly adherent and strong biofilm producers. In a mouse infection model bap was involved in pathogenesis, causing a persistent infection.
TI  - Identification of a non-haem catalase in Salmonella and its regulation by RpoS (sigmaS).
AB  - We report the identification and functional analysis of katN, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. katN, which is not present in Escherichia coli, is located between the yciGFE and yciD E. coli homologues in the Salmonella genome. Its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 Da and is similar to the Mn-catalases of Lactobacillus plantarum and Thermus spp. Its product, KatN, was visualized as a 37 kDa protein in E. coli maxicells. A KatN recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its C-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. KatN was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. Its expression was shown to be regulated by growth phase and rpoS. Northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream yciGFE genes. A putative rpoS-regulated promoter was identified upstream of yciG. Southern blotting revealed that katN is conserved within Salmonella serovars. katN homologues were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. A katN mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) response of Salmonella. However, the expression of katN increased the H2O2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpoS mutants in stationary phase. Thus, KatN may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in Salmonella in certain environmental conditions.
TI  - SirA orthologs affect both motility and virulence.
AB  - The sirA gene of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes a two-component  response regulator of the FixJ family that has a positive regulatory influence on the expression of type III secretion genes involved with epithelial cell invasion and the elicitation of bovine gastroenteritis. SirA orthologs in Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and Erwinia control the expression of distinct virulence genes in these genera, but an evolutionarily conserved target of SirA regulation has never been identified. In this study we tested the hypothesis that sirA may be an ancient member of the flagellar regulon. We examined the effect of a sirA mutation on transcriptional fusions to flagellar promoters (flhD, fliE, fliF, flgA, flgB, fliC, fliD, motA, and fliA) while using fusions to the virulence gene sopB as a positive control. SirA had only small regulatory effects on all fusions in liquid medium (less than fivefold). However, in various types of motility agar plates, sirA was able to activate a sopB fusion by up to 63-fold while repressing flagellar fusions by values exceeding 100-fold. Mutations in the sirA orthologs of Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa result in defects in either motility or motility gene regulation, suggesting that control of flagellar regulons may be an evolutionarily conserved function of sirA orthologs. The implications for our understanding of virulence gene regulation in the gamma Proteobacteria are discussed.
TI  - Caenorhabditis elegans is a model host for Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The idea of using simple, genetically tractable host organisms to study the virulence mechanisms of pathogens dates back at least to the work of Darmon and Depraitere [1]. They proposed using the predatory amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum as a model host, an approach that has proved to be valid in the case of the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila [2]. Research from the Ausubel laboratory has clearly established the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an attractive model host for the study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis [3]. P. aeruginosa is a bacterium that is capable of infecting plants, insects and mammals. Other pathogens with a similarly broad host range have also been shown to infect C. elegans [3,4]. Nevertheless, the need to determine the universality of C. elegans as a model host, especially with regards pathogens that have a naturally restricted host specificity, has rightly been expressed [5]. We report here that the enterobacterium Salmonella typhimurium, generally considered to be a highly adapted pathogen with a narrow range of target hosts [6], is capable of infecting and killing C. elegans. Furthermore, mutant strains that exhibit a reduced virulence in mammals were also attenuated for their virulence in C. elegans, showing that the nematode may constitute a useful model system for the study of this important human pathogen.
TI  - Salmonella typhimurium proliferates and establishes a persistent infection in the intestine of Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - Genetic analysis of host-pathogen interactions has been hampered by the lack of genetically tractable models of such interactions. We showed previously that the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa kills Caenorhabditis elegans, that P. aeruginosa and C. elegans genes can be identified that affect this killing, and that most of these P. aeruginosa genes are also important for mammalian pathogenesis. Here, we show that Salmonella typhimurium as well as other Salmonella enterica serovars including S. enteritidis and S. dublin can also kill C. elegans. When C. elegans is placed on a lawn of S. typhimurium, the bacteria accumulate in the lumen of the worm intestine and the nematodes die over the course of several days. This killing requires contact with live bacterial cells. The worms die with similar kinetics when placed on a lawn of S. typhimurium for a relatively short time (3-5 hours) before transfer to a lawn of E. coli. After the transfer to E. coli, a high titer of S. typhimurium persists in the C. elegans intestinal lumen for the rest of the worms' life. Furthermore, feeding for 5 hours on a 1:1000 mixture of S. typhimurium and E. coli followed by transfer to 100% E. coli, also led to death after several days. This killing correlated with an increase in the titer of S. typhimurium in the C. elegans lumen, which reached 10,000 bacteria per worm. These data indicate that, in contrast to P. aeruginosa, a small inoculum of S. typhimurium can proliferate in the C. elegans intestine and establish a persistent infection. S. typhimurium mutated in the PhoP/PhoQ signal transduction system caused significantly less killing of C. elegans.
TI  - Characterization of chloramphenicol and florfenicol resistance in Escherichia coli associated with bovine diarrhea.
AB  - Florfenicol, a veterinary fluorinated analog of thiamphenicol, is approved for treatment of bovine respiratory pathogens in the United States. However, florfenicol resistance has recently emerged among veterinary Escherichia coli isolates incriminated in bovine diarrhea. The flo gene, which confers resistance to florfenicol and chloramphenicol, has previously been identified in Photobacterium piscicida and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104. The flo gene product is closely related to the CmlA protein identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cmlA gene confers nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance via an efflux mechanism. Forty-eight E. coli isolates recovered from calves with diarrhea, including 41 that were both chloramphenicol and florfenicol resistant, were assayed for the presence of both flo and cmlA genes. Forty-two of the 44 isolates for which florfenicol MICs were > or =16 microg/ml were positive via PCR for the flo gene. All E. coli isolates for which florfenicol MICs were < or =8 microg/ml were negative for the flo gene (n = 4) Twelve E. coli isolates were positive for cmlA, and chloramphenicol MICs for all 12 were > or =32 microg/ml. Additionally, eight isolates were positive for both flo and cmlA, and both florfenicol and chloramphenicol MICs for these isolates were > or =64 microg/ml. DNA sequence analysis of the E. coli flo gene demonstrated 98% identity to the published GenBank sequences of both serovar Typhimurium flo(St) and P. piscicida pp-flo. The flo gene was identified on high-molecular-weight plasmids of approximately 225 kb among the majority of florfenicol-resistant E. coli isolates. However, not all of the florfenicol-resistant E. coli isolates tested contained the large flo-positive plasmids. This suggests that several of the E. coli isolates may possess a chromosomal flo gene. The E. coli flo gene specifies nonenzymatic cross-resistance to both florfenicol and chloramphenicol, and its presence among bovine E. coli isolates of diverse genetic backgrounds indicates a distribution much wider than previously thought.
TI  - Purification and characterization of WaaP from Escherichia coli, a lipopolysaccharide kinase essential for outer membrane stability.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the waaP (rfaP) gene product is required for the addition of phosphate to O-4 of the first heptose residue of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inner core region. This phosphate substitution is particularly important to the biology of these bacteria; it has previously been shown that WaaP is necessary for resistance to hydrophobic and polycationic antimicrobials in E. coli and that it is required for virulence in invasive strains of S. enterica. WaaP function is also known to be essential for the viability of P. aeruginosa. The predicted WaaP protein shows low levels of similarity (10-15% identity) to eukaryotic protein kinases, but its kinase activity has never been tested. Here we report the purification of WaaP and the reconstitution of its enzymatic activity in vitro. The purified enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of 33P from [gamma-33P]ATP into acceptor LPS purified from a defined E. coli waaP mutant. Enzymatic activity is dependent upon the presence of Mg2+ and is maximal from pH 8.0 to 9.0. The apparent Km (determined at saturating concentrations of the second substrate) is 0.13 mm for ATP and 76 microm for LPS. These data are the first proof that WaaP is indeed an LPS kinase. Further, site-directed mutagenesis of a predicted catalytic residue suggests that WaaP shares a common mechanism of action with eukaryotic protein kinases.
TI  - Bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria, a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium SL1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice. Antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice infected by the lethal S typhimurium C5 strain. RESULTS: Fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were examined for antimicrobial activity. Two strains (CA1 and F9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular S typhimurium SL1344 in Caco-2 cells. An antibacterial component(s) produced by CA1 and F9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. In the axenic C3/He/Oujco mice, CA1 and F9 strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against S typhimurium C5 lethal infection. CONCLUSION: Several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.
TI  - Permeability barrier of the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane with special reference to nisin.
AB  - The effect of nisin pretreatment on organic acid-induced permeability increase in strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. marginalis, and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium was investigated, using assays based on the uptake of a fluorescent dye 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) and on the bacterial susceptibility to detergent-induced bacteriolysis. The outer membrane of bacteria which had been pretreated with nisin was shown to be less stable against 1 mM EDTA, as indicated by their significantly higher NPN uptake levels as compared to untreated bacteria. Upon challenge with a tenfold lower concentration of EDTA (0.1 mM) some nisin-treated strains (Typhimurium, P. marginalis) exhibited, however, NPN uptake levels which were lower than those seen in control bacteria, suggesting that nisin had stabilized their outer membrane. Nisin pretreatment also decreased the NPN uptake induced by citric or lactic acid or both in E. coli, P. marginalis, and Typhimurium, whereas in P. aeruginosa the pretreatment resulted in increased NPN uptake in response to citric and lactic acid. These results suggest that, with the exception of P. aeruginosa, nisin could protect bacteria from the outer membrane-disrupting effect caused by the acids. P. aeruginosa was, however, shown to be protected against bacteriolysis induced by the detergents sodium dodecylsulfate and Triton X-100. With a pair of isogenic mutants of Typhimurium differing in their cell surface charge it was shown that the NPN uptake response to I mM EDTA of the abnormally cationic strain was not significantly affected by nisin, whereas in the normal anionic strain nisin strongly strengthened the uptake. Our hypothesis based on these findings is that the normally anionic cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria has a tendency to bind the cationic nisin. The binding of nisin to the surface does not proceed to the cytoplasmic membrane, but in the outer membrane the bound nisin actually stabilizes its structure through electrostatic interactions. With the exception of EDTA, the organic acids at pH 4 did not cause leakage of cell contents from Typhimurium, indicating that these acids do not permeabilize the outer membrane to an extent required for cytoplasmic pore formation by nisin.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some 5-guanylhydrazone/thiocyanato-6-arylimidazo[2,1-b]-1,3, 4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide derivatives.
AB  - 6-Arylimidazo[2,1-b]-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamides 3 on Vilsmeier-Haak reaction produced 5-formyl-6-arylimidazo[2,1-b]-1,3, 4-thiadiazole-2-[N-(dimethylaminomethino)]sulfonamides 4, while 3 on treatment with potassium thiocyanate in the presence of bromine in acetic acid produced 5-thiocyanato-2-sulfonamides 6. Interaction of 4 with aminoguanidine hydrochloride in ethanol produced the corresponding 5-guanylhydrazone derivatives 5. Compounds 5 and 6 showed a high degree of antibacterial activity against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus comparable to that of sulfamethoxazole and Norfloxacin. However, they were found to show moderate activity against Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pneumococci.
TI  - High-affinity interaction between gram-negative flagellin and a cell surface polypeptide results in human monocyte activation.
AB  - Flagella from diverse gram-negative bacteria induce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) synthesis by human monocytes (F. Ciacci-Woolwine, P. F. McDermott, and S. B. Mizel, Infect. Immun. 67:5176-5185, 1999). In this study, we establish that purified flagellin (FliC or FljB), the major filament protein from Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an extremely potent inducer of TNF-alpha production by human monocytes and THP-1 myelomonocytic cells. Fifty percent of maximal TNF-alpha production (EC(50)) was obtained with 1.5 x 10(-11) M flagellin (0.75 ng/ml). Mutagenesis studies revealed that the central hypervariable region of flagellin is essential for the TNF-alpha-inducing activity of the protein. Although less active than the wild-type protein, a Salmonella flagellin mutant composed of only the central hypervariable region retained substantial TNF-alpha-inducing activity at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, the conserved amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are inactive. Mutational analysis of the hypervariable region revealed that it contains two equally active TNF-alpha-inducing domains. The ability of THP-1 cells to respond to purified flagellins is dramatically reduced by mild trypsin treatment of the cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the cytokine-inducing activity of flagellins from gram-negative bacteria results from the interaction of these proteins with high-affinity cell surface polypeptide receptors on monocytes.
TI  - Hadrurin, a new antimicrobial peptide from the venom of the scorpion Hadrurus aztecus.
AB  - A new antimicrobial peptide, hadrurin, was isolated from the venom of the Mexican scorpion Hadrurus aztecus, by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column, followed by high performance liquid chromatography. It is a basic peptide composed of 41 amino-acid residues with a molecular mass of 4436 Da, and contains no cysteines. A model of the three-dimensional folding of hadrurin is compatible with that of an amphipatic molecule with two alpha-helical segments. Hadrurin demonstrates antimicrobial activity at low micromolar concentration, inhibiting the growth of bacteria such as: Salmonella thyphi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Serratia marscences. It also shows cytolytic activity when tested in human erythrocytes. Hadrurin and two analogs (C-terminal amidated, and all D-enantiomer) were chemically synthesized. They were used to study the possible molecular mechanism of action by testing their ability to dissipate the diffusion potential of liposomes of different compositions. The results obtained indicate that there are no specific receptor molecules for the action of hadrurin, and the most probable mechanism is through a membrane destabilization activity. It is surmised that hadrurin is used by the scorpion as both an attack and defense element against its prey and putative invasive microorganisms. It is a unique peptide among all known antimicrobial peptides described, only partially similar to the N-terminal segment of gaegurin 4 and brevinin 2e, isolated from frog skin. It would certainly be a model molecule for studying new antibiotic activities and peptide-lipid interactions.
TI  - Role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in innate immunity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
AB  - Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection occurs in 75-90% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is the foremost factor in pulmonary function decline and early mortality. A connection has been made between mutant or missing CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in lung epithelial cell membranes and a failure in innate immunity leading to initiation of P. aeruginosa infection. Epithelial cells use CFTR as a receptor for internalization of P. aeruginosa via endocytosis and subsequent removal of bacteria from the airway. In the absence of functional CFTR, this interaction does not occur, allowing for increased bacterial loads in the lungs. Binding occurs between the outer core of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide and amino acids 108-117 in the first predicted extracellular domain of CFTR. In experimentally infected mice, inhibiting CFTR-mediated endocytosis of P. aeruginosa by inclusion in the bacterial inoculum of either free bacterial lipopolysaccharide or CFTR peptide 108-117 resulted in increased bacterial counts in the lungs. CFTR is also a receptor on gastrointestinal epithelial cells for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the etiologic agent of typhoid fever. There was a significant decrease in translocation of this organism to the gastrointestinal submucosa in transgenic mice that are heterozygous carriers of a mutant DeltaF508 CFTR allele, suggesting heterozygous CFTR carriers may have increased resistance to typhoid fever. The identification of CFTR as a receptor for bacterial pathogens could underlie the biology of CF lung disease and be the basis for the heterozygote advantage for carriers of mutant alleles of CFTR.
TI  - TrfA-dependent inner membrane-associated plasmid RK2 DNA synthesis and association of TrfA with membranes of different gram-negative hosts.
AB  - TrfA, the replication initiator protein of broad-host-range plasmid RK2, was tested for its ability to bind to the membrane of four different gram-negative hosts in addition to Escherichia coli: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Cells harboring TrfA-encoding plasmids were fractionated into soluble, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions. The fractions were subjected to Western blotting, and the blots were probed with antibody to the TrfA proteins. TrfA was found to fractionate with the cell membranes of all species tested. When the two membrane fractions of these species were tested for their ability to synthesize plasmid DNA endogenously (i.e., without added template or enzymes), only the inner membrane fraction was capable of extensive synthesis that was inhibited by anti-TrfA antibody in a manner similar to that of the original host species, E. coli. In addition, although DNA synthesis did occur in the outer membrane fraction, it was much less extensive than that exhibited by the inner membrane fraction and only slightly affected by anti-TrfA antibody. Plasmid DNA synthesized by the inner membrane fraction of one representative species, P. aeruginosa, was characteristic of supercoil and intermediate forms of the plasmid. Extensive DNA synthesis was observed in the soluble fraction of another representative species, R. sphaeroides, but it was completely unaffected by anti-TrfA antibody, suggesting that such synthesis was due to repair and/or nonspecific chain extension of plasmid DNA fragments.
TI  - Oxygen requirement for the biosynthesis of the S-2-hydroxymyristate moiety in Salmonella typhimurium lipid A. Function of LpxO, A new Fe2+/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase homologue.
AB  - Lipid A molecules of certain Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, may contain secondary S-2-hydroxyacyl chains. S. typhimurium has recently been shown to synthesize its S-2-hydroxymyristate-modified lipid A in a PhoP/PhoQ-dependent manner, suggesting a possible role for the 2-OH group in pathogenesis. We postulated that 2-hydroxylation might be catalyzed by a novel dioxygenase. Lipid A was extracted from a PhoP-constitutive mutant of S. typhimurium grown in the presence or absence of O(2). Under anaerobic conditions, no 2-hydroxymyristate-containing lipid A was formed. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of lipid A from cells grown in the presence of (18)O(2) confirmed the direct incorporation of molecular oxygen into 2-hydroxyacyl-modified lipid A. Using several well characterized dioxygenase protein sequences as probes, tBLASTn searches revealed unassigned open reading frame(s) with similarity to mammalian aspartyl/asparaginyl beta-hydroxylases in bacteria known to make 2-hydroxyacylated lipid A molecules. The S. typhimurium aspartyl/asparaginyl beta-hydroxylase homologue (designated lpxO) was cloned into pBluescriptSK and expressed in Escherichia coli K-12, which does not contain lpxO. Analysis of the resulting construct revealed that lpxO expression is sufficient to induce O(2)-dependent formation of 2-hydroxymyristate-modified lipid A in E. coli. LpxO very likely is a novel Fe(2+)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of lipid A (or of a key precursor). The S. typhimurium lpxO gene encodes a polypeptide of 302 amino acids with predicted membrane-anchoring sequences at both ends. We hypothesize that 2-hydroxymyristate chains released from lipopolysaccharide inside infected macrophages might be converted to 2-hydroxymyristoyl coenzyme A, a well characterized, potent inhibitor of protein N-myristoyl transferase.
TI  - Functional analysis of genes in the rfb locus of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo subtype Hardjobovis.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key antigen in immunity to leptospirosis. Its biosynthesis requires enzymes for the biosynthesis and polymerization of nucleotide sugars and the transport through and attachment to the bacterial membrane. The genes encoding these functions are commonly clustered into loci; for Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo subtype Hardjobovis, this locus, named rfb, spans 36.7 kb and contains 31 open reading frames, of which 28 have been assigned putative functions on the basis of sequence similarity. Characterization of the function of these genes is hindered by the fact that it is not possible to construct isogenic mutant strains in Leptospira. We used two approaches to circumvent this problem. The first was to clone the entire locus into a heterologous host system and determine if a "recombinant" LPS or polysaccharide was synthesized in the new host. The second approach used putative functions to identify mutants in other bacterial species whose mutations might be complemented by genes on the leptospiral rfb locus. This approach was used to investigate the function of three genes in the leptospiral rfb locus and demonstrated function for orfH10, which complemented a wbpM strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and orfH13, which complemented an rfbW strain of Vibrio cholerae. However, despite the similarity of OrfH11 to WecC, a wecC strain of E. coli was not complemented by orfH11. The predicted protein encoded by orfH8 is similar to GalE from a number of organisms. A Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain producing no GalE was used as a background in which orfH8 produced detectable GalE enzyme activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a chitooligosaccharide mixture prepared by cellulase digestion of shrimp chitosan and its application to milk preservation.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a chitooligosaccharide mixture prepared by digestion of shrimp chitosan with cellulase at 50 degrees C for 14 h was evaluated. Sugars with 1 to 8 degrees of polymer (DP) were found in this chitooligosaccharide mixture, and the weight percentage of sugars with DP > or = 6 was 44.3%. Minimal lethal concentrations of this mixture against Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in nutrient broth were 5 to 29 ppm, which were much lower than those of the chitosan reactant (50 to 1,000 ppm). The antibacterial activity of this mixture in the sterilized milk against E. coli O157, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and S. aureus was much stronger at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. When raw milk was supplemented with either 0.24% or 0.48% (wt/vol) of this oligosaccharide mixture and stored at 4 degrees C for 12 days, its mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts were reduced by at least 3 log cycles, and there was very little change in pH. In addition, this mixture retarded the growth of Salmonella species and caused quicker reduction of Staphylococcus species in raw milk. Accordingly, the shelf life of raw milk at 4 degrees C was extended by at least 4 days.
TI  - The NRAMP proteins of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli are selective manganese transporters involved in the response to reactive oxygen.
AB  - NRAMPs (natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins) have been characterized in mammals as divalent transition metal transporters involved in iron metabolism and host resistance to certain pathogens. The mechanism of pathogen resistance is proposed to involve sequestration of Fe2+ and Mn2+, cofactors of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic catalases and superoxide dismutases, not only to protect the macrophage against its own generation of reactive oxygen species, but to deny the cations to the pathogen for synthesis of its protective enzymes. NRAMP homologues are also present in bacteria. We report the cloning and characterization of the single NRAMP genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica ssp. typhimurium, and the cloning of two distinct NRAMP genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an internal fragment of an NRAMP gene in Burkholderia cepacia. The genes are designated mntH because the two enterobacterial NRAMPs encode H+-stimulated, highly selective manganese(II) transport systems, accounting for all Mn2+ uptake in each species under the conditions tested. For S. typhimurium MntH, the Km for 54Mn2+ ( approximately 0.1 microM) was pH independent, but maximal uptake increased as pH decreased. Monovalent cations, osmotic strength, Mg2+ and Ca2+ did not inhibit 54Mn2+ uptake. Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibited uptake with Kis greater than 100 microM, Co2+ with a Ki of 20 microM and Fe2+ with a Ki that decreased from 100 microM at pH 7. 6 to 10 microM at pH 5.5. Fe3+ and Pb2+ inhibited weakly, exhibiting Kis of 50 microM, while Cd2+ was a potent inhibitor with a Ki of about 1 microM. E. coli MntH had a similar inhibition profile, except that Kis were three- to 10-fold higher. Both S. typhimurium and E. coli MntH also transport 55Fe2+ however, the Kms are equivalent to the Kis for Fe2+ inhibition of Mn2+ uptake, and are thus too high to be physiologically relevant. In both S. typhimurium and E. coli, mntH:lacZ constructs were strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, weakly induced by EDTA and unresponsive to paraquat, consistent with the presence of Fur and OxyR binding sites in the promoters. Strains overexpressing mntH were more susceptible to growth inhibition by Mn2+ and Cd2+ than wild type, and strains lacking a functional mntH gene were more susceptible to killing by hydrogen peroxide. In S. typhimurium strain SL1344, mntH mutants showed no defect in invasion of or survival in cultured HeLa or RAW264.7 macrophage cells; however, expression of mntH:lacZ was induced severalfold by 3 h after invasion of the macrophages. S. typhimurium mntH mutants showed only a slight attenuation of virulence in BALB/c mice. Thus, the NRAMP Mn2+ transporter MntH and Mn2+ play a role in bacterial response to reactive oxygen species and possibly have a role in pathogenesis.
TI  - Lactic acid permeabilizes gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the outer membrane.
AB  - The effect of lactic acid on the outer membrane permeability of Escherichia coli  O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was studied utilizing a fluorescent-probe uptake assay and sensitization to bacteriolysis. For control purposes, similar assays were performed with EDTA (a permeabilizer acting by chelation) and with hydrochloric acid, the latter at pH values corresponding to those yielded by lactic acid, and also in the presence of KCN. Already 5 mM (pH 4.0) lactic acid caused prominent permeabilization in each species, the effect in the fluorescence assay being stronger than that of EDTA or HCl. Similar results were obtained in the presence of KCN, except for P. aeruginosa, for which an increase in the effect of HCl was observed in the presence of KCN. The permeabilization by lactic and hydrochloric acid was partly abolished by MgCl(2). Lactic acid sensitized E. coli and serovar Typhimurium to the lytic action of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) more efficiently than did HCl, whereas both acids sensitized P. aeruginosa to SDS and to Triton X-100. P. aeruginosa was effectively sensitized to lysozyme by lactic acid and by HCl. Considerable proportions of lipopolysaccharide were liberated from serovar Typhimurium by these acids; analysis of liberated material by electrophoresis and by fatty acid analysis showed that lactic acid was more active than EDTA or HCl in liberating lipopolysaccharide from the outer membrane. Thus, lactic acid, in addition to its antimicrobial property due to the lowering of the pH, also functions as a permeabilizer of the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane and may act as a potentiator of the effects of other antimicrobial substances.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide core phosphates are required for viability and intrinsic drug  resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is notorious for its intrinsic drug resistance. We have used chemical and genetic techniques to characterize three putative kinase genes that are involved in the addition of phosphate to the inner core region of P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide. The first gene is a waaP homologue, whereas the other two (wapP and wapQ) are unique to P. aeruginosa. Repeated attempts using a variety of membrane-stabilizing conditions to generate waaP:Gm (Gm, gentamicin) or wapP:Gm mutants were unsuccessful. We were able to generate a chromosomal waaP mutant that had a wild-type copy of either waaPPa or waaPEc in trans, but were unable to cure this plasmid-borne copy of the gene. These results are consistent with the fact that P. aeruginosa mutants lacking inner core heptose (Hep) or phosphate have never been isolated and demonstrate the requirement of Hep-linked phosphate for P. aeruginosa viability. A wapQ:Gm mutant was isolated and it had an unaltered minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for novobiocin and only a small decrease in the MIC for sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), suggesting that the loss of a phosphate group transferred by WapQ may only be having a small impact on outer-membrane permeability. Nuclear magnetic resonance and methylation linkage analysis showed that WaaPPa could add one phosphate to O4 of HepI in a Salmonella typhimurium waaP mutant. The expression of WaaPPa increased the outer-membrane integrity of these complemented mutants, as evidenced by 35-fold and 75-fold increases in the MIC for novobiocin and SDS respectively. The S. typhimurium waaP mutant transformed with both waaP and wapP had over 250-fold and 1000-fold increases, respectively, in these MICs. The inner core phosphates of P. aeruginosa appear to be playing a key role in the intrinsic drug resistance of this bacterium.
TI  - Effects of the hinge region of cecropin A(1-8)-magainin 2(1-12), a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, on liposomes, bacterial and tumor cells.
AB  - A 20-residue hybrid peptide (CA(1-8)-MA(1-12): KWKLFKKIGIGKFLHSAKKF-NH(2)) incorporating 1-8 residues of cecropin A (CA) and 1-12 residues of magainin 2 (MA) has potent antibiotic activity without hemolytic activity. In order to investigate the effects of the flexible hinge sequence, Gly-Ile-Gly of CA(1-8)-MA(1-12) (CA-MA) on antibiotic activity, CA-MA and its three analogues, CA-MA1, CA-MA2 and CA-MA3 were synthesized. The Gly-Ile-Gly sequence of CA-MA was deleted in CA-MA1 and replaced with Pro and Gly-Pro-Gly in CA-MA2 and CA-MA3, respectively. CA-MA1 and CA-MA3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity against four different tumor cells, and the PC/PS (4:1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities. However, CA-MA2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities, as compared with CA-MA. These results suggested that the flexibility or beta-turn induced by Gly-Ile-Gly or Pro in the central part of CA-MA may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short alpha-helical region in the N-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical region in the C-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane. CA-MA3 exhibited lower activity in antibacterial, antitumor, and vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities than CA-MA and CA-MA2. This result suggested that the excessive beta-turn structure by Gly-Pro-Gly in CA-MA3 seems to interrupt the ion channel/pore formation on the lipid bilayer. It was concluded that the appropriate flexibility or beta-turn structure provided by the central hinge is responsible for the effective antibiotic activity of the antimicrobial peptides with the helix-hinge-helix structure.
TI  - Impact of heterogeneity within cultured cells on bacterial invasion: analysis of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar typhi entry into MDCK cells by using a green fluorescent protein-labelled cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator receptor.
AB  - The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride ion  channel that also serves as a receptor for entry of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi into epithelial cells. To evaluate heterogeneity in CFTR protein expression in cultured cells and the effect of heterogeneity on internalization of different P. aeruginosa and serovar Typhi strains, we used two-color flow cytometry and confocal laser microscopy to study bacterial uptake by Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) type I epithelial cells stably expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR fusion construct (MDCK-GFP-CFTR cells). We found a strong correlation between cell size and GFP-CFTR protein expression, with 60 to 70% of cells expressing low levels of GFP-CFTR protein, 20 to 30% expressing intermediate levels, and <10% expressing high levels. The cells were sorted into low-, intermediate-, or high-level producers of CFTR protein; in vitro growth of each sorted population yielded the same distribution of CFTR protein expression as that in the original population. Cells expressing either low or high levels of CFTR protein internalized bacteria poorly; maximal bacterial uptake occurred in the cells expressing intermediate levels of CFTR protein. Treatment of MDCK cells with sodium butyrate markedly enhanced the production of CFTR protein without increasing cell size; butyrate treatment also increased the proportion of cells with internalized bacteria. However, there were fewer bacteria per butyrate-treated cell and, for P. aeruginosa, there was an overall decrease in the total level of bacterial uptake. The most highly ingested bacterial strains were internalized by fewer total MDCK-GFP-CFTR cells, indicating preferential bacterial uptake by a minority of epithelial cells within a given culture. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that P. aeruginosa and serovar Typhi induced cytoplasmic accumulation of CFTR protein close to the plasma membrane where the bacteria were adherent. These results show that within a population of MDCK-GFP-CFTR cells, there are cells with markedly different abilities to ingest bacteria via CFTR, the majority of the P. aeruginosa and serovar Typhi cells are ingested by the one-fourth to one-third of the cells that exhibit an intermediate size and level of CFTR protein expression, and overexpression of the CFTR receptor does not increase total bacterial uptake but rather allows more epithelial cells to ingest fewer total bacteria.
TI  - Effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  - The ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate E. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. The effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of E. coli in broth medium showed that only EDTA and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of E. coli by nisin. In a broth where L. lactis NCFB 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 IU/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate E. coli. Under the same conditions, addition of EDTA led to inactivation of E. coli at neutral and slightly acidic pH only. A cocktail of strains of E. coli was less sensitive than E. coli ATCC 25922 alone. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant. EDTA also caused a slight reduction in the L. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards pH drop and acid production. Some of the inhibition of E. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of Lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. Failure to observe any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural pH (4.0) was ascribed to the poor chelating power of EDTA under acid conditions.
TI  - Inorganic polyphosphate is required for motility of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The ppk gene encodes polyphosphate kinase (PPK), the principal enzyme in many bacteria responsible for the synthesis of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) from ATP. A null mutation in the ppk gene of six bacterial pathogens renders them greatly impaired in motility on semisolid agar plates; this defect can be corrected by the introduction of ppk gene in trans. In view of the fact that the motility of pathogens is essential to invade and establish systemic infections in host cells, this impairment in motility suggests a crucial and essential role of PPK or polyP in bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of Vi conjugate vaccines for typhoid fever in adults, teenagers, and 2- to 4-year-old children in Vietnam.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi, Vi, is an essential virulence factor and a protective vaccine for people older than 5 years. The safety and immunogenicity of two investigational Vi conjugate vaccines were evaluated in adults, 5- to 14-year-old children, and 2- to 4-year-old children in Vietnam. The conjugates were prepared with Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exoprotein A (rEPA) as the carrier, using either N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP; Vi-rEPA(1)) or adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH; Vi-rEPA(2)) as linkers. None of the recipients experienced a temperature of >38.5 degrees C or significant local reactions. One injection of Vi-rEPA(2) into adults elicited a geometric mean (GM) increase in anti-Vi immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 9.62 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units/ml (EU) to 465 EU at 6 weeks; this level fell to 119 EU after 26 weeks. In the 5- to 14-year-old children, anti-Vi IgG levels at 6 weeks elicited by Vi-rEPA(2), Vi-rEPA(1), and Vi were 169, 22.8, and 18.9 EU, respectively (P = 0.0001 for Vi-rEPA(1) and Vi with respect to Vi-rEPA(2)). At 26 weeks, the anti-Vi IgG levels for recipients of Vi-rEPA(2), Vi-rEPA(1), and Vi were 30.0, 10.8, and 13.4 EU, respectively (P < 0.001 for Vi-rEPA(1) and Vi with respect to Vi-rEPA(2)); all were higher than the preinjection levels (P = 0. 0001). Vi-rEPA(2) also elicited the highest anti-Vi IgM and IgA levels of the three vaccines. In the 2- to 4-year-old children at 6 weeks following the first injection, Vi-rEPA(2) elicited an anti-Vi IgG level of 69.9 EU compared to 28.9 EU for Vi-rEPA(1) (P = 0.0001). Reinjection increased Vi antibody levels from 69.9 to 95.4 EU for Vi-rEPA(2) and from 28.9 to 83.0 EU for Vi-rEPA(1). At 26 weeks, anti-Vi IgG levels remained higher than those at preinjection (30.6 versus 0.18 for Vi-rEPA(2) and 12.8 versus 0.33 for Vi-rEPA(1); P = 0.0001 for both). Vi vaccine is recommended for individuals of 5 years of age or older. In the present study, the GM level of anti-Vi IgG elicited by two injections of Vi-rEPA(2) in the 2- to 4-year-old children was higher than that elicited by Vi in the 5- to 14-year-old children (30.6 versus 13.4; P = 0.0001). The safety and immunogenicity of the Vi-rEPA(2) conjugate warrant further investigation.
TI  - Membrane vesicles derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shigella flexneri can be integrated into the surfaces of other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Incubation of intact Salmonella typhi Ty21a, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium) aroA or Escherichia coli DH5 alpha with membrane vesicles (MVs) derived from either Shigella flexneri M90T or Pseudomonas aeruginosa dsp89 resulted in a significant incorporation of vesicle antigens into the outer membrane of the bacteria; each recipient strain possessed a surface mosaic of new Shigella and Pseudomonas antigens intermixed with the native antigens of the Salmonella or Escherichia strains. Electron microscopy of preparations during the integration of vesicle antigens revealed that the MVs rapidly fused with the outer membrane of the host strains. Western blot analysis of host bacteria confirmed the integration of foreign antigens. Quantitative analysis for binding and fusion of antigens using an ELISA showed that approximately 78.7 +/- 12.8 ng of the Pseudomonas and 67.5 +/- 13.8 ng of the Shigella LPSs (microgram host protein)-1 were integrated into the Sal. typhimurium strain. Similar integrations of the Shigella or Pseudomonas vesicles were found with the E. coli or Sal. typhi strains. There was no loss of viability in the recipient bacteria after incorporation of the MVs, although vesicle antigens became diluted during continued growth as daughter cells shared the vesicle antigens. The new antigens were highly stable after being incorporated into recipient strains, being able to withstand storage of several months at 4 degrees C as well as several cycles of freezing and thawing. Since the recipient bacteria are common vaccine strains, the procedure described here offers a simple efficient means of introducing exogenous surface antigens, in their native form, into the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria for possible vaccine use.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and other plant extracts.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. However, few investigations have compared large numbers of oils and extracts using methods that are directly comparable. In the present study, 52 plant oils and extracts were investigated for activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia col, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, using an agar dilution method. Lemongrass, oregano and bay inhibited all organisms at concentrations of < or = 2.0% (v/v). Six oils did not inhibit any organisms at the highest concentration, which was 2.0% (v/v) oil for apricot kernel, evening primrose, macadamia, pumpkin, sage and sweet almond. Variable activity was recorded for the remaining oils. Twenty of the plant oils and extracts were investigated, using a broth microdilution method, for activity against C. albicans, Staph. aureus and E. coli. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.03% (v/v) thyme oil against C. albicans and E. coli and 0.008% (v/v) vetiver oil against Staph. aureus. These results support the notion that plant essential oils and extracts may have a role as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - [The role of the structural parts of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in its direct immunosuppressive activity].
AB  - The direct immunosuppressive activity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and their structural parts (O-chains, R-core, lipid A), obtained from Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, was studied. LPS preparations were extracted by the phenol-water method. Structural parts of LPS were obtained by acetic acid hydrolysis and gel filtration. The study demonstrated that all these preparations, when injected intraperitoneally into mice, did not affect the level of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the test antigen in the animals. After redox treatment all LPS preparations became capable of suppressing DTH. After redox treatment such immunosuppressive activity could be observed in lipid A, while O-specific chains and R-core remained inactive. After phenol treatment immunosuppressive activity disappeared. Chemical groups capable of activation were likely to be located in lipid A or in lipid A-associated protein.
TI  - Water quality for aquaculture development in Bahia Blanca estuary, Argentina. Bacteriological studies.
AB  - The present bacteriological report is part of an institutional multidisciplinary  research project designed to study the factibility of using a tidal channel, located in the southern part of the Canal Principal in Bahia Blanca Estuary for aquaculture. Three sampling stations were located. Samples were taken in six opportunities from both water and sediments. Bacteriological studies from water included quantification of heterotrophic marine bacteria, heterotrophic terrestrial bacteria, total coliforms, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Escherichia coli and hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were quantified from sediments. It is important to include the latter physiological group since their size reflects the presence and fluctuations of this type of pollutant in the environment. The evaluation of faecal indicator values leads to the conclusion that the organic matter present in the studied area, does not come directly from the domestic sewage. The bacteriological data suggest that the studied area would be suitable for aquaculture. Nevertheless, further monitorings contributing to detected modifications in the present bacteriological conditions are recommended.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of an operon involved in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O5 (PAO1) genomic DNA fragment that was able to complement a temperature-sensitive mutation in the 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) 8-P synthase gene (kdsA) of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was cloned. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a potential operon with the gene order pyrG, kdsA, eno. PyrG catalyzes the synthesis of the nucleotide cytidine triphosphate, while Eno catalyzes the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate from phosphoglycerate during glycolysis. Phosphoenolpyruvate is one of the substrates for Kdo-8-P biosynthesis by KdsA and cytidine triphosphate is the nucleotide used to activate Kdo prior to its transfer to lipid A. pyrG and eno are important for many metabolic pathways and it is interesting to find them linked to kdsA. A sigma 70-like promoter was found upstream of pyrG and evidence was provided to show that this promoter was responsible for the initiation of transcription of the genes in this operon. These genes mapped to 28.2-29.9 min on the 75-min PAO1 chromosome, unlinked to other lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters.
TI  - Extracellular iron reductases: identification of a new class of enzymes by siderophore-producing microorganisms.
AB  - This study identifies extracellular iron reductases in culture supernatant fluids of the siderophore-producing microorganisms Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These enzymes were constitutively produced and reduced and released iron from a variety of ferric chelators. Dialyzable cofactors, necessary for the transfer of electrons in the enzymatic reduction of iron, were identified. The reductases were sensitive to treatment with proteinase K and guanidine-HCl, were not associated with siderophore activity, and were apparently released from the cell as extracellular enzymes. The acquisition of 59Fe2+ by cell suspensions of E. coli and P. aeruginosa was saturable, suggesting that the ferrous iron generated by these reductases can be bound and transported. Salmonella typhimurium mutants feoB, tonB, entB, and entBfeoB, deficient in numerous known iron uptake pathways, were found to exhibit substantial extracellular iron-reducing activities over that of the parent. A hypothesis is proposed in which the extracellular iron reductases excreted by siderophore-producing microorganisms may be responsible for the mobilization of iron during conditions of iron repletion when siderophores are repressed and may also function in concert with siderophores during periods of iron starvation.
TI  - Biological properties of structurally related alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - A series of alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptide variants with small amino acid changes was designed. Alterations in the charge, hydrophobicity, or length of the variant peptides did not improve the antimicrobial activity, and there was no statistically significant correlation between any of these factors and the MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella typhimurium. Individual peptides demonstrated synergy with conventional antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. The peptides varied considerably in the ability to bind E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and this correlated significantly with their antimicrobial activity and ability to block LPS-stimulated tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 production. In general, the peptides studied here demonstrated a broad range of activities, including antimicrobial, antiendotoxin, and enhancer activities.
TI  - Evolution of the delta F508 CFTR mutation.

TI  - Interaction of NK lysin, a peptide produced by cytolytic lymphocytes, with endotoxin.
AB  - NK lysin is a 9-kDa polypeptide that was originally isolated from porcine intestinal tissue based on its antibacterial activity. It is produced by cytolytic lymphocytes and is cytolytic against a number of different types of tumor cells. Here we report the binding of NK lysin to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its anti-LPS activity. NK lysin binds to matrix-coated LPS from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and different strains of Salmonella enterica. Lipid A and polymyxin B inhibited the binding, demonstrating a preferential interaction of NK lysin with the lipid part of LPS. Chromium-labeled lymphoma cells were lysed by NK lysin, and LPS dose-dependently inhibited the cytolysis at equimolar amounts. In the same manner, NK lysin inhibited certain LPS-stimulated effects on mouse bone marrow cells as well as LPS binding to mouse granulocytes. These results suggest that NK lysin may be a another natural LPS-binding protein from lymphocytes that may participate in the endogenous defense response associated with elevated concentrations of LPS.
TI  - Community-acquired septicaemia in southern Viet Nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi.
AB  - In a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern Viet Nam. Gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly Salmonella typhi (67%), Sal. para-typhi A (3%), Escherichia coli (10%), and Klebsiella spp. (5%). Other Salmonella spp. (1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), Neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (P < 0.001) and had a lower mortality rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; P < 0.0001). Over 70% of the Sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Multidrug-resistant Sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in Viet Nam.
TI  - Selectivity of ferric enterobactin binding and cooperativity of transport in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The ligand-gated outer membrane porin FepA serves Escherichia coli as the receptor for the siderophore ferric enterobactin. We characterized the ability of seven analogs of enterobactin to supply iron via FepA by quantitatively measuring the binding and transport of their 59Fe complexes. The experiments refuted the idea that chirality of the iron complex affects its recognition by FepA and demonstrated the necessity of an unsubstituted catecholate coordination center for binding to the outer membrane protein. Among the compounds we tested, only ferric enantioenterobactin, the synthetic, left-handed isomer of natural enterobactin, and ferric TRENCAM, which substitutes a tertiary amine for the macrocyclic lactone ring of ferric enterobactin but maintains an unsubstituted catecholate iron complex, were recognized by FepA (Kd approximately 20 nM). Ferric complexes of other analogs (TRENCAM-3,2-HOPO; TREN-Me-3,2-HOPO; MeMEEtTAM; MeME-Me-3,2-HOPO; K3MECAMS; agrobactin A) with alterations to the chelating groups and different net charge on the iron center neither adsorbed to nor transported through FepA. We also compared the binding and uptake of ferric enterobactin by homologs of FepA from Bordetella bronchisepticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium in the native organisms and as plasmid-mediated clones expressed in E. coli. All the transport proteins bound ferric enterobactin with high affinity (Kd </= 100 nM) and transported it at comparable rates (>/=50 pmol/min/10(9) cells) in their own particular membrane environments. However, the FepA and IroN proteins of S. typhimurium failed to efficiently function in E. coli. For E. coli, S. typhimurium, and P. aeruginosa, the rate of ferric enterobactin uptake was a sigmoidal function of its concentration, indicating a cooperative transport reaction involving multiple interacting binding sites on FepA.
TI  - Transition metals as protease inhibitors.
AB  - An alternative approach to the development of clinically useful protease inhibitors was investigated. The approach utilized coordination chemistry of transition metal ions rather than substrate analogs to block active sites of these enzymes. In the case of serine proteases it was found that aqueous Ti(IV) is a potent inhibitor of the trypsin subclass, but not the chymotrypsin subclass. The direct binding of Ti(IV) to trypsin was made possible by the presence of a free carboxyl group at the bottom of the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme, and the five-coordinate geometry of TiO(SO4)(H2O). Although initial binding of Ti(IV) was reversible, it was followed in time by irreversible inhibition. Direct binding of octahedral or tetrahedral metal ion complexes was prevented by the inability of the enzyme active sites to promote formation of a five-coordinate transition state of the metal ion required for reaction. These studies demonstrate the ability of direct metal ion binding as a way to enhance blocking of enzyme active sites as compared with that of traditional organic inhibitors. Application of these findings was investigated by measuring the affect Ti(IV) had on growth of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Five-coordinate titanyl sulfate completely inhibited the growth of these organisms. This suggests that five-coordinate titanyl sulfate, which is easier and less expensive to manufacture than conventional antibiotics, may be useful in controlling endemic infections of E. coli and S. typhimurium.
TI  - [Electron microscopic study of pathogenic bacteria on environmental objects].
AB  - The morphological picture of different bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus  vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica O3, Y.pseudotuberculosis 1, Y.frederiksenii, Y.intermedia, Y.kristensenii) on environmental objects was studied with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria adhered to the surface of pieces of fodder, egg shell, cabbage leaves and form microcolonies, whose morphology was similar to colonies, grown on nutrient media. The cells produced extracellular substances, seen in SEM as integuments. These integuments were gourd to protect the population from the action of unfavorable factors.
TI  - Syntheses of new isodethiaazacephems as potent antibacterial agents.
AB  - New isodethiaazacephems (+/-)-3, (+/-)-4, and (+/-)-10 as well as the 4-sulfonylated isodethiaazacepham (+/-)-5 were synthesized by chemical methods and found to possess biological activity against five pathogenic microorganisms in vitro. The mesylate and the triflate functionalities in (+/-)-3 and (+/-)-4, acting as effective leaving groups, enhanced remarkably the biological activity in comparison with the parent 3-hydroxyisodethiaazacephem (+/-)-10. The mode of action related to (+/-)-3 and (+/-)-4 can be explained by a [1,4]-elimination process.
TI  - The regulated outer membrane protein Omp21 from Comamonas acidovorans is identified as a member of a new family of eight-stranded beta-sheet proteins by its sequence and properties.
AB  - Omp21, a minor outer membrane protein of the soil bacterium Comamonas acidovorans, was purified from a spontaneous mutant lacking a surface layer and long-chain lipopolysaccharide. Omp21 synthesis is enhanced by oxygen depletion, and the protein has a variable electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis due to its heat-modifiable behavior. The structural gene omp21 encodes a precursor of 204 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids. Mature Omp21 is a typical outer membrane protein with a high content of beta structure as determined by infrared spectroscopy. Sequence comparisons show that it belongs to a new outer membrane protein family, characterized by eight amphipathic beta strands, which includes virulence proteins, such as the neisserial opacity proteins, Salmonella typhimurium Rck, and Yersinia enterocolitica Ail, as well as the major outer membrane proteins OmpA from Escherichia coli and OprF from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The specific and sensitive detection of bacterial pathogens within 4 h using bacteriophage amplification.
AB  - This paper describes a novel approach, termed the 'phage amplification assay', for the rapid detection and identification of specific bacteria. The technique is based on the phage lytic cycle with plaque formation as the assay end-point. It is highly sensitive, quantitative and gives results typically within 4 h. The assay comprises four main stages: (1) phage infection of target bacterium; (2) destruction of exogenous phage; (3) amplification of phage within infected host and (4) plaque formation from infected host with the aid of helper bacteria. A key component of this assay is a potent virucidal agent derived from natural plant extracts, pomegranate rind extract (PRE). In combination with ferrous sulphate PRE can bring about an 11 log-cycle reduction in phage titre within 3 min. This is achieved without any injury to the infected target bacteria. Subsequently, any resulting plaques are derived only from infected target organisms. Data are presented for a range of bacterial hosts including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The detection limit for Ps. aeruginosa was 40 bacteria ml-1 in a time of 4 h and 600 bacteria m-1 for Salm. typhimurium. Application of the principles of this technology to other bacterial genera is discussed.
TI  - Insights into the mechanism of catalysis by the P-C bond-cleaving enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase derived from gene sequence analysis and mutagenesis.
AB  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde to acetaldehyde and inorganic phosphate. In this study, the genes encoding phosphonatase in Bacillus cereus and in Salmonella typhimurium were cloned for high-level expression in Escherichia coli. The kinetic properties of the purified, recombinant phosphonatases were determined. The Schiff base mechanism known to operate in the B. cereus enzyme was verified for the S. typhimurium enzyme by phosphonoacetaldehyde-sodium borohydride-induced inactivation and by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic lysine 53. The protein sequence inferred from the B. cereus phosphonatase gene was determined, and this sequence was used along with that from the S. typhimurium phosphonatase gene sequence to search the primary sequence databases for possible structural homologues. We found that phosphonatase belongs to a novel family of hydrolases which appear to use a highly conserved active site aspartate residue in covalent catalysis. On the basis of this finding and the known stereochemical course of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphorus (retention), we propose a mechanism which involves Schiff base formation with lysine 53 followed by phosphoryl transfer to aspartate (at position 11 in the S. typhimurium enzyme and position 12 in the B. cereusphosphonatase) and last hydrolysis at the imine C(1) and acyl phosphate phosphorus.
TI  - Elution of lipopolysaccharides from polyacrylamide gels.
AB  - A simple procedure for elution in water of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels is described. It consists of the combination of three principal steps: first, highly sensitive on-gel LPS detection (1-10 ng/band) with zinc-imidazole (negative or reverse staining); second, washing of the individual LPS band in a solution of a zinc-complexing agent (e.g., 100 mM EDTA); and finally, elution of the LPS (100-200 microliters water for a 0.5-microgram LPS band) from gel microparticles for 3 h at room temperature. Using this procedure, we have successfully eluted a variety of LPS forms from Bordetella pertussis, Escherichia coli 0111:B4, E. coli K-235, Salmonella enteritidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Elution recovery of rough or semismooth LPS was about 70-80%, while that of smooth LPS was only about 10%. Eluted LPS was biologically active as tested by limulus amebocyte lysate and TNF-alpha assays.
TI  - Surface characteristics of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in an atomic  force microscope image.
AB  - Bacterial images can be obtained rather easily with an atomic-force microscope (AFM) in the magnification range of 5,000 to 30,000 times without any pretreatment of the specimens for such observations as chemical fixation, dehydration or staining. The bacterial shapes or the presence of flagella can be clearly recognized in these magnification ranges. In addition, we were also able to distinguish between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria based on the specific wavy surface appearance of the former. AFM could thus be a useful tool for the identification of bacteria in the resolution range between electron and light microscopy.
TI  - Bacterial toxin-induced pulmonary epithelial cytotoxicity and the protective effect of dibutyryl-cAMP.
AB  - Bacterial infection is the most common cause of the adult respiratory distress syndrome which, in turn is associated with endothelial capillary permeability and alveolar oedema. Previously, we have demonstrated the direct cytotoxicity of the bacterial toxins Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (Exo A) and Salmonella enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on pulmonary endothelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Exo A and LPS on pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro. We also tested the protective effect of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) on Exo A-induced cytotoxicity. In cultured rat alveolar epithelial cells (RAEC) Exo A caused cytotoxicity as measured by 51Cr release from these cells. LPS did not injure RAEC's. Pretreatment of RAEC with db-cAMP (1 mM) attenuated Exo A induced cytotoxicity. We conclude that (1) Exo A directly injures epithelial lung cells and may contribute to lung injury in cases of bacterial infection; (2) db-cAMP protects alveolar epithelial cells against Exo A-induced cytotoxicity and (3) alveolar epithelial cells in this model are resistant to LPS induced injury.
TI  - Antibacterial and chemical evaluation of Chromolaena moritziana.
AB  - Chromolaena moritziana (Sch. Bip. ex Hieron.) King & Robin. (Asteraceae) is used  in local ethnomedicine as an anticatarrhal, a depurative and in the treatment of skin diseases. This ethnopharmacological information has a direct correlation with that reported for other Chromolaena species. Dichloromethane and aqueous extracts from the leaves as well as ethyl acetate extracts from the flowers have shown antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and a UV-V light effect was not observed against this bacterium. These results may justify the ethnomedical use in skin infections. The flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, rutin and isoquercitrin as well as the triterpene alpha-amyrin were isolated.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic parameters of gentamicin and their effect on biological properties of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro postantibiotic effect (PAE) and the postantibiotic effect of subinhibitory concentrations (PA SME) of gentamicin were investigated on clinical isolates of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The PAE was induced by 2 x MIC and 4 x MIC of gentamicin for 0.5 h. The PA SME were studied by the addition of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 x MIC during the postantibiotic phase of the bacteria. The S. enteritidis strain did no regrow after affecting of supra-subinhibitory concentrations for 24 h with exception of the concentration 2 x MIC + 0.1 x MIC. The PAEs against P. aeruginosa were nearly identical for all the suprainhibitory concentrations tested (4.4-4.6 h) and no regrowth after PA SME was observed. The studied pharmacodynamic parameters decreased the surface hydrophobicity of Salmonella sp., mainly of S. enteritidis, evaluated by the ability to bind Congo red and by the aggregation in solutions of ammonium sulphate (SAT). Gentamicin in suprainhibitory concentrations expressively decreased the phospholipase C production--an important virulence factor of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Polyethyleneimine is an effective permeabilizer of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of the polycation polyethyleneimine (PEI) on the permeability properties of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane was investigated using Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium as target organisms. At concentrations of less than 20 micrograms ml-1, PEI increased the bacterial uptake of 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine, which is a hydrophobic probe whose quantum yield is greatly increased in a lipid environment, indicating increased hydrophobic permeation of the outer membrane by PEI. The effect of PEI was comparable to that brought about by the well-known permeabilizer EDTA. Permeabilization by PEI was retarded but not completely inhibited by millimolar concentrations of MgCl2. PEI also increased the susceptibility of the test species to the hydrophobic antibiotics clindamycin, erythromycin, fucidin, novobiocin and rifampicin, without being directly bactericidal. PEI sensitized the bacteria to the lytic action of the detergent SDS in assays where the bacteria were pretreated with PEI. In assays where PEI and SDS were simultaneously present, no sensitization was observed, indicating that PEI and SDS were inactivating each other. In addition, a sensitizing effect to the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was observed for P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, PEI was shown to be a potent permeabilizer of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LA1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells (M. F. Bernet, D. Brassard, J. R. Neeser, and A. L. Servin, Gut 35:483-489, 1994). Here, we demonstrate that strain LA1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by Salmonella typhimurium. We present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain LA1 (LA1-SCS) contained antibacterial components active against S. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae. By contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The LA1-SCS antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two genes, waaC (rfaC) and waaF (rfaF), involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O5 inner-core biosynthesis.
AB  - Recent studies have provided evidence to implicate involvement of the core oligosaccharide region of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adherence to host tissues. To better understand the role played by LPS in the virulence of this organism, the aim of the present study was to clone and characterize genes involved in core biosynthesis. The inner-core regions of P. aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are structurally very similar; both contain two main chain residues of heptose linked to lipid A-Kdo2 (Kdo is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid). By electrotransforming a P. aeruginosa PAO1 library into Salmonella waaC and waaF (formerly known as rfaC and rfaF, respectively) mutants, we were able to isolate the homologous heptosyltransferase I and II genes of P. aeruginosa. Two plasmids, pCOREc1 and pCOREc2, which restored smooth LPS production in the waaC mutant, were isolated. Similarly, plasmid pCOREf1 was able to complement the Salmonella waaF mutant. Sequence analysis of the DNA insert of pCOREc2 revealed one open reading frame (ORF) which could code for a protein of 39.8 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the deduced protein exhibited 53% identity with the sequence of the WaaC protein of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. pCOREf1 contained one ORF capable of encoding a 38.4-kDa protein. The sequence of the predicted protein was 49% identical to the sequence of the Salmonella WaaF protein. Protein expression by the Maxicell system confirmed that a 40-kDa protein was encoded by pCOREc2 and a 38-kDa protein was encoded by pCOREf1. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the map locations of the cloned waaC and waaF genes, which were found to lie between 0.9 and 6.6 min on the PAO1 chromosome. Using a gene-replacement strategy, we attempted to generate P. aeruginosa waaC and waaF null mutants. Despite multiple attempts to isolate true knockout mutants, all transconjugants were identified as merodiploids.
TI  - Synthesis and immunological properties of Vi and di-O-acetyl pectin protein conjugates with adipic acid dihydrazide as the linker.
AB  - The Vi capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi, a licensed vaccine for typhoid fever in individuals > or = 5 years old, induces low and short-lived antibodies in children, and reinjection does not elicit booster responses at any age. Its immunogenicity was improved by binding Vi to proteins by using N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) as a linker. Similar findings were observed with the structurally related, di-O-acetyl derivative of pectin [poly-alpha(1-->4)-D-GalpA] designated OAcP. Protein conjugates of Vi and OAcP were synthesized by carbodiimide-mediated synthesis with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) as the linker. Hydrazide groups were introduced into proteins (bovine serum albumin or recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein A) by treatment with ADH and 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC). The resultant adipic acid hydrazide derivatives (AH-proteins), containing 2.3 to 3.4% AH, had antigenic and physicochemical properties similar to those of the native proteins. The AH-proteins were bound to Vi and OAcP by treatment with EDC. The immunogenicity of Vi or OAcP, alone or as protein conjugates, was evaluated in young outbred mice and guinea pigs by subcutaneous injection of 2.5 and 5.0 microg, respectively, of polysaccharide, and antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All conjugates were significantly more immunogenic than Vi or OAcP alone and induced booster responses with 5- to 25-fold increases of antibodies. Vi conjugates were significantly more immunogenic than their OAcP analogs. A carboxymethyl derivative of yeast beta-glucan enhanced the anti-Vi response elicited by an OAcP conjugate but had no effect on the immunogenicity of Vi or of OAcP alone. Vi and OAcP conjugates synthesized by this scheme will be evaluated clinically.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Siderophore activity of chemically synthesized dihydroxybenzoyl derivatives of spermidines and cystamide.
AB  - Chemically synthesized dihydroxybenzoyl derivatives of spermidine and cystamide containing two-, three- and four-bidentates with the hydroxyl groups in 2,3 or 3,4 position were examined in cross-feeding tests using Gram-negative siderophore indicator strains carrying different iron-related markers, and two Mycobacterium spp. The catecholates were unable to feed tonB mutants of E. coli and S. typhimurium as well as the fepA, fiu, cir mutant of E. coli, pointing to a tonB- and fepA, cir, fiu-dependent transport. Bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)derivatives promoted Salmonella spp, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains significantly better than did 3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl derivatives. N4-substituted spermidines acted more effectively than non-substituted derivatives. Bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl) cystamide was superior to the other catecholates tested in growth promotion of Gram-negative bacteria. The two four-bidentates and the tri-bidentate reacted to K. pneumoniae in an inhibitory mode. The position of the hydroxyl groups did not significantly influence the growth promotion of M. smegmatis and M. fortiutum in the cases of substituted spermidines and of cystamides.
TI  - Bacterial porins stimulate bone resorption.
AB  - Porins are abundant outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria involved in transport of low-molecular-mass molecules. During the past decade, porins from a number of bacteria have also been shown to have proinflammatory activities including inducing the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators (cytokines, platelet-activating factor, and nitric oxide) in cultured cells and inducing inflammation in vivo. With this range of actions, it was possible that porins could also interact with bone cells to cause aberrant bone remodeling and that this could contribute to the bone destruction seen in gram-negative bone infections. By using purified preparations of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa porins, in the presence of polymyxin B, it was possible to induce concentration-dependent loss of calcium from cultured murine calvaria at porin concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 nM. The mechanism of action of the porins was determined by the inclusion of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or inflammatory cytokines in the culture media. The bone-resorbing activity of both porins was not inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or by neutralizing the activity of tumor necrosis factor. Indeed, relatively high concentrations of these agents produced an unexpected increase in the bone resorption induced by the porins. In contrast, porin-induced bone resorption could be inhibited by relatively high concentrations of the natural inhibitor of interleukin-1 (IL-1 receptor antagonist). It appears that these porins stimulate bone resorption by a mechanism distinct from that of lipopolysaccharide, and the possibility therefore exists that porins play a role in bone destruction in gram-negative bacterial infections of bone.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa B-band O-antigen chain length is modulated by Wzz (Ro1).
AB  - The wbp gene cluster, encoding the B-band lipopolysaccharide O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O5 strain PAO1, was previously shown to contain a wzy (rfc) gene encoding the O-antigen polymerase. This study describes the molecular characterization of the corresponding wzz (rol) gene, responsible for modulating O-antigen chain length. P. aeruginosa O5 Wzz has 19 to 20% amino acid identity with Wzz of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella flexneri. Knockout mutations of the wzz gene in serotypes O5 and O16 (which has an O antigen structurally related to that of O5) yielded mutants expressing O antigens with a distribution of chain lengths differing markedly from that of the parent strains. Unlike enteric wzz mutants, the P. aeruginosa wzz mutants continued to display some chain length modulation. The P. aeruginosa O5 wzz gene complemented both O5 and O16 wzz mutants as well as an E. coli wzz mutant. Coexpression of E. coli and P. aeruginosa wzz genes in a rough strain of E. coli carrying the P. aeruginosa wbp cluster resulted in the expression of two populations of O-antigen chain lengths. Sequence analysis of the region upstream of wzz led to identification of the genes rpsA and himD, encoding 30S ribosomal subunit protein S1 and integration host factor, respectively. This finding places rpsA and himD adjacent to wzz and the wbp cluster at 37 min on the PAO1 chromosomal map and completes the delineation of the O5 serogroup-specific region of the wbp cluster.
TI  - Protective effect of adenylate deaminase (from Penicillium lanoso-viride) against acute infections in mice.
AB  - We examined the effects of the immunomodulator-adenylate deaminase (E.C. 3.5.4.6) from Penicillium lanoso-viride on experimental mice infections. Prophylactic intraperitoneal administration of adenylate deaminase (ADA) increased survival time and numbers of survivors after infection with Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and influenza A (H3N2) virus. Protection against influenza virus after intranasal ADA application was also observed. The influence of ADA was time and dose dependent. The most pronounced protection was obtained by administration of 3 U ADA/mice 24 h prior to infection. ADA had no antibiotic effect against these bacterial strains. Protective effects of ADA were studied in immunosuppressed mice under different regimes of treatment including cyclosporin A and trypan blue. The results indicated, that the protective effect of ADA is of a complex nature and probably depends on both T-cell and macrophage components.
TI  - A secreted protein tyrosine phosphatase with modular effector domains in the bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - A number of bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to subvert  host-cell signal-transduction pathways for their own benefit. These bacteria produce and export proteins capable of specific interactions with key mammalian cell regulatory molecules in order to derail the normal functions of the cells. In this study, we describe the identification of a modular effector protein secreted by the bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium that is required for its full display of virulence. Sequence analysis revealed that a carboxy-terminal region of this protein, which we have termed SptP, is homologous to the catalytic domains of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Purified SptP protein efficiently dephosphorylated peptide substrates phosphorylated on tyrosine. An engineered mutant of SptP in which a critical Cys residue in the catalytic domain was changed to Ser was devoid of phosphatase activity, indicating a catalytic mechanism similar to that of other tyrosine phosphatases. In addition, an amino-terminal region of SptP exhibited sequence similarity to the ribosyltransferase exoenzyme S from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the cytotoxin YopE from Yersinia spp. The modular nature of this effector protein may allow multiple interactions with host-cell signalling functions.
TI  - Cloning, complementation, and characterization of an rfaE homolog from Neisseria  gonorrhoeae.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae WS1 is a spontaneous pyocin (a bacteriocin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa)-resistant mutant of N. gonorrhoeae FA19 that produces a truncated lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and is non-transformable. The LOS-specific mutation in WS1 was moved into a transformable background by transforming FA19 with chromosomal DNA from WS1 (generating strain JWS-1). A clone (pJCL2) capable of restoring JWS-1 to wild-type LOS expression, as detected by its acquisition of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies and by its complemented sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile, was isolated. Sequential unidirectional deletion and DNA sequence analysis of pJCL2 identified an open reading frame, designated lsi-7, that could complement the defect in JWS-1. Homology searches against various databases indicated that lsi-7 bad homology with several Escherichia coli genes involved in the phosphorylation of sugars. lsi-7 is adjacent to the lsi-6 gene, another gene involved in LOS biosynthesis. Complementation studies using Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide mutants showed lsi-6 and lsi-7 to be gonococcal homologs of S. typhimurium rfaD and rfaE, respectively. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis demonstrated that lsi-6 and lsi-7 are part of the same transcriptional unit.
TI  - Conserved C-terminus of the phosphatase CheZ is a binding domain for the chemotactic response regulator CheY.
AB  - CheZ is the phosphatase of the chemotactic response regulator, CheY. There are three conserved domains on CheZ. Here we determined the function of the C-terminal domain (residues 202-214). A truncated form of CheZ, missing residues 202-214, hardly bound to the phosphorylated form of CheY. Conversely, a peptide composed of the last 19 amino acid residues of the CheZ (residues 196-214), generated by tryptic digestion, bound specifically to the phosphorylated form of CheY. This was demonstrated by both fluorescence depolarization of the peptide (labeled with fluorescein) and cross-linking. It is concluded that the conserved C-terminus of CheZ functions as a CheY-binding domain.
TI  - A human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  - It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.
TI  - Immune functions of immunoglobulin Y isolated from egg yolk of hens immunized with various infectious bacteria.
AB  - We studied the immune functions of IgY obtained from hens immunized with a mixture of formalin-treated pathogenic bacteria. The IgY inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the production of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin-A, and adhesion of Salmonella enteritidis to cultured human intestinal cells (Caco 2). The results indicated that IgY specific for plural bacteria has effects useful toward prevention of bacterial diseases.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaPER-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - Plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of Ambler class A are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. Salmonella typhimurium JMC isolated in Argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pMVP-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. The beta-lactamase PER-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; CTI-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pI of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. The blaPER-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pBluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PER-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that PER-2 is not closely related to TEM or SHV enzymes (25 to 26% homology). PER-2 is most closely related to PER-1 (86.4% homology), an Ambler class A enzyme first detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An enzyme with an amino acid sequence identical to that of PER-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Turkey. Our data indicate that PER-2 and PER-1 represent a new group of Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PER-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in South America, while the incidence of PER-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to Turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, caused by PER-1 beta-lactamase, in Salmonella typhimurium from Istanbul, Turkey.
AB  - Two Salmonella typhimurium isolates were studied, one as a representative from a  series of neonatal meningitis cases treated at an Istanbul teaching hospital, the other from a gastro-enteritis case seen at a different Istanbul hospital. Both isolates were resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as penicillins, aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. Cephalosporin resistance depended on production of PER-1 beta-lactamase, which is an extended-spectrum class A enzyme that is only distantly related to TEM and SHV enzymes, and which was previously known only from Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The PER-1 gene was carried by an 81-MDa plasmid, which also determined resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. Although it was not self-transmissible to Escherichia coli, this element did transfer if mobilised with plasmid pUZ8. The two S. typhimurium isolates gave indistinguishable DNA restriction patterns and, in addition to their 81-MDa plasmid, also contained 52- and 2.8-MDa plasmids, the last of these encoded TEM-1 enzyme. The two isolates were identical in serotype, antibiogram and plasmid-profile but nevertheless differed in phage type, and, therefore, represented distinct strains. The emergence of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone resistance in salmonellae is disturbing, since these agents are preferred therapy for neonatal meningitis caused by members of the genus.
TI  - Survival of enterobacteria in liquid cultures during microwave radiation and conventional heating.
AB  - Bacteria in food have been reported to survive in larger numbers after processing by microwave radiation than after conventional processing. The bactericidal effect of a domestic microwave oven (SHARP R-7280) on certain pathogenic enterobacteria species was investigated in vitro, in comparison with conventional heating (boiling). The death rates of different nosocomial strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella sofia, Salmonella enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. The microwave oven and the conventional heating system used were both calibrated in order to calculate temperatures from exposure times. For each strain duplicate samples of 25 ml of pure culture with concentrations at least 10(6) cfu/ml were exposed to microwave radiation. An equal number of samples of the same volume and concentration were exposed to conventional heating. Subsequently all samples were examined qualitatively and quantitatively following standard microbiological procedures. The results indicate that microwaves have an efficient bactericidal effect on the enterobacteria in liquid cultures.
TI  - Clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the murine gastrointestinal tract is effectively mediated by O-antigen-specific circulating antibodies.
AB  - The colonization of mucosal surfaces by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can lead to local  or disseminated disease. Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) has been assumed to be responsible for preventing mucosal colonization by interfering with the binding of bacterial ligands to epithelial surface receptors. However, the efficacy of this mechanism of immunity derives little actual support from in vivo experiments. In an investigation of the role of local and systemic immunization strategies in reducing colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by P. aeruginosa, the bacterial antigens that were potential targets for immune effectors promoting mucosal clearance were identified. Levels of gastrointestinal colonization were reduced when immunity to homologous O antigens, but not that to pili or flagella, was elicited. Oral vaccination with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium expressing P. aeruginosa serogroup O11 antigen elicited mucosal and serum IgA antibodies and serum IgG antibodies specific for the recombinant antigen. Oral challenge of immunized mice with P. aeruginosa serogroup O11 demonstrated protection against gastrointestinal colonization. Intraperitoneal immunization with a serogroup O11 high-molecular-weight O-polysaccharide antigen elicited only serum IgG and IgM antibodies yet was as effective as oral vaccination in protecting mice against gastrointestinal colonization. This finding was confirmed by the demonstration that intraperitoneal immunization with purified lipopolysaccharide was also protective against mucosal surface colonization. These results call into question the need for local immune effectors, particularly secretory IgA, directed at bacterial ligands for epithelial surface components, in protecting a mucosal surface from bacterial challenge.
TI  - Secretory monoclonal IgA class-switch variants against bacterial enteric pathogens in bile and intestinal secretions.
AB  - In a previous study we analyzed the molecular forms of monoclonal IgA class-switch variants (moIgA variants) and their transport into murine respiratory secretions. The aim of the present study is to characterize the transport of moIgA variants into bile and intestinal secretions so that their applicability in a passive immunization model of the gut can be evaluated. Different moIgA variants were directly isolated from IgG1 and IgG2a producing hybridoma clones specific for the same surface determinants of bacterial enteric pathogens (Salmonella typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni) as their respective parent IgG clones. Hepatobiliary transport experiments clearly revealed the selective transport of biologically active polymeric forms of the IgA variants into the murine and rat bile after intravenous injection. Biotinylation of polymeric IgA variants prior to intravenous injection resulted in the recovery of functional, labeled SIgA. Moreover biotin-labeled polymeric IgA variant was recovered in bile with an increased molecular weight, suggesting that the secretory component had been added during passage through the liver. When IgA variant and IgG parent clones were both used in a murine backpack tumor model for passive immunization, IgA variant was selectively transported into intestinal secretions in comparison to IgG. The experimental model described here is suitable for use in comparative studies on the role of IgA and IgG with identical specificity in invasive infections of the intestinal tract.
TI  - Effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics against R-plasmid-bearing bacteria.
AB  - The effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of nine beta-lactam antibiotics [penicillin-G, ampicillin (ABPC), cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, cephalothin, cephradine, cefazolin (CEZ) and cefoxitin] against seven different R-plasmid-bearing gram-negative bacterial strains were tested. Morphological changes, such as filamentous development and lysis, occurred at concentrations considerably lower than the MIC values and the presence of R plasmids did not influence the morphological changes compared with those of Escherichia coli NIHJ, which is non-R-plasmid-bearing. Clear cooperation of ABPC and CEZ with rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMNs against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris and of CEZ against Salmonella typhimurium was observed, but not against the other strains tested. Therefore, the filamentous bacteria produced as a result of exposure to sub-MICs of antibiotics were not always phagocytosed easily. The ratios between the drug concentrations (microgram/ml) at which the morphological changes began to occur (minimal antibiotic concentration) and the MIC values (microgram/ml) were calculated. A large ratio indicated a wide range of effective concentrations below the MIC value for that antibiotic.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a substance produced by the fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus (Fr.) Murr.
AB  - A fraction obtained from the culture fluids of Pycnoporus sanguineus fungus was shown to contain a compound with biological activity against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and members of the genus Streptococcus. The fraction was clearly more active on Gram-positive cocci than on Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Efficacy of new organic ammonium salts on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The inhibitory activities of four new homologous series of organic ammonium salts (OAS) were tested on bacterial strains isolated from patients. Two types of compounds are used: "hard" (group A) and three groups (B, C, D) of biodegradable "soft" OAS with metabolically labile CO or NH groups in their molecules. The strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the sputum of a patient with carcinoma. The strain Salmonella typhimurium was isolated from a patient with clinical diagnosis of diarrhea. In all homologous series, the antibacterial activity was increasing continuously with the length of alkyl chain up to dodecyl or tetradecyl, then the "cut off" effect was observed. The most active compounds from both "hard" and "soft" types had superior activity to commercial disinfectants. The strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive to these compounds than that of Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - The host range of RK2 minimal replicon copy-up mutants is limited by species-specific differences in the maximum tolerable copy number.
AB  - The minimal replicon of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 consists of a gene, trfA (trans-acting replication), encoding a protein required for initiation of plasmid replication. The TrfA protein binds to iterons in the cis-acting origin of vegetative replication (oriV), but the exact mechanism by which TrfA-mediated replication initiation takes place is not known. We report here the isolation and characterization of five mini RK2 trfA mutant plasmids with an elevated plasmid copy number, four in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one in Azotobacter vinelandii. The mutations are localized between or downstream of previously reported Escherichia coli copy-up mutations in trfA, and one of the mutations has been described earlier as an independent copy-up isolate in E. coli. The five mutant plasmids were all moderately copy up in both E. coli and their host of origin, in spite of the use of isolation procedures which were expected to select efficiently in favor of plasmid mutants specifying high copy numbers. In contrast, previously described high copy-up mutants isolated in E. coli could not be established in P. aeruginosa and A. vinelandii. These high copy-up mutants were shown to induce cell killing in E. coli under conditions where the plasmid copy number was increased as a physiological response to reduced growth rate. We propose that the reason for this killing effect is that the copy number under these conditions exceeds an upper tolerance level specific for E. coli. By assuming that the corresponding tolerance level is lower in P. aeruginosa and A. vinelandii than in E. coli, and that the mechanism of copy number regulation is similar, the model can explain the phenotypes of all tested copy up mutants in these two hosts. Analogous studies were also performed in Salmonella typhimurium and Acetobacter xylinum. The data obtained in these studies indicate that the above model is probably generally true for gram-negative bacteria, and the results also indicate that the maximum tolerable copy number is surprisingly low in some hosts.
TI  - Laboratory and preliminary clinical characterization of Vi capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines.
AB  - To improve its immunogenicity for children and adults and to make it suitable for routine immunization of infants against typhoid fever, the capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi (Vi) was bound to the B subunit of the heat-labile toxin (LT-B) of Escherichia coli or the recombinant exoprotein A (rEPA) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The conjugates elicited higher levels of antibodies (micrograms per milliliter of serum) in mice and in guinea pigs than did Vi and, unlike Vi alone, elicited booster antibody responses in both species. In adult volunteers, Vi-LT-B and Vi-rEPA, respectively, elicited higher levels of antibodies than Vi alone after the first injection (4.74 versus 1.77 and 4.91 versus 1.77; P < 0.005) and 26 weeks later (2.32 and 2.69 versus 0.54; P < 0.04); a second injection of the conjugates did not elicit a booster response of Vi antibodies. None of the 51 vaccinees had fever or significant local reactions. Vi-rEPA elicited slightly higher levels of Vi antibodies than did Vi-LT-B at all intervals after injection, but these differences were not significant. Each conjugate elicited antibodies to its carrier protein. The antibody responses elicited in adults by Vi bound to LT-B and rEPA are similar to those of other polysaccharide-protein conjugates. These conjugates promise to be an improved Vi vaccine. Studies of Vi conjugates with adults and infants in areas where typhoid is endemic are planned.
TI  - Organomercury(II) complexes of kojic acid and maltol: synthesis, characterization, and biological studies.
AB  - A number of organomercury(II) complexes of kojic acid (HL1, I) and maltol (HL2, II) of the type p-XC6H4HgL1 (III) and p-XC6H4HgL2 (IV) [X = Me, MeO, NO2] have been synthesized and characterized. [formula: see text] Conductance measurements indicate the nonelectrolyte behavior of the complexes. From IR and UV studies, the bonding modes of the ligands to the organomercury(II) moieties have been elucidated. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra support the stoichiometry of the complexes. The fragmentation pattern has been analyzed on the basis of mass spectra. From thermal studies (TG and DTA), various kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for thermal degradation have been enumerated. The complexes have been screened against some pathogenic bacterial strains. The bactericidal activity has been correlated with the thermal data.
TI  - Protection against lethal bacterial infection in mice by monocyte-chemotactic and -activating factor.
AB  - Chemotactic factors regulate the recruitment of neutrophils, lymphocytes, or monocytes-macrophages to infectious and inflammatory sites. The purpose of this study was to determine whether monocyte-chemotactic and -activating factor (MCAF [MCP-1], a JE gene product) also influences the host defense mechanism against microbial infection. We evaluated the effect of recombinant human MCAF on the survival rate of mice systemically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Salmonella typhimurium. The administration of 2.5 micrograms of MCAF 6 h before infection completely protected the mice from lethal infection. Mice with cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia exhibiting increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa were also endowed with resistance by the same dose of MCAF. Administration of MCAF at -6 h was critical, since MCAF given either earlier or later than -6 h failed to rescue mice from lethal infection. The in vivo effect on the survival of mice paralleled the reduced recovery of viable P. aeruginosa or S. typhimurium from the peritoneal cavity, i.e., the number of recovered bacteria from the MCAF (2.5 micrograms per mouse)-treated mice was reduced to less than 2% of control mice for P. aeruginosa and 4% of control mice for S. typhimurium at 24 h. Since MCAF exhibited chemotaxis on murine macrophages as well as enhanced phagocytosis and killing of bacteria in vitro, the activation of macrophages, followed by the recruitment into the peritoneal cavity, is responsible for eliminating bacteria and thus enhancing the survival rate.
TI  - Genetic analysis of Escherichia coli O9 rfb: identification and DNA sequence of phosphomannomutase and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase genes.
AB  - Subcloning, transposon insertion, and deletion analysis revealed that the Escherichia coli O9 rfb region is about 12 kb in size. The region encodes at least seven polypeptides of 89, 74, 55, 50, 44, 41 and 39.5 kDa. Southern hybridization analysis of rfb regions of E. coli O8 and O9, and Klebsiella O3 and O5 serotypes (all of these O polysaccharides are mannose homopolymers and the structures of the repeating unit of E. coli O9 and Klebsiella O3 are identical) showed that a central region specific for E. coli O9 and Klebsiella O3 is flanked by two regions common to all four. Complementation experiments using strains with known defects and specific tests for the enzymic activity showed that the 50 and 55 kDa polypeptides, encoded by the common region, are phosphomannomutase (PMM) and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMP), respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of the region revealed the presence of two genes, rfbK and rfbM, analogous to the corresponding genes of Salmonella typhimurium. In E. coli O9, rfbK and rfbM encode proteins of 460 amino acids (50,809 Da) and 471 amino acids (52,789 Da). The amino acid sequence of GMP was conserved in RfbMs of E. coli O7 and Salmonella groups B, C1 and C2, CpsB of S. typhimurium, AlgA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and XanB of Xanthomonas campestris. The phylogenetic trees of PMM and GMP were different in topology and in the evolutionary distances from ancestors.
TI  - [Oxygenation of pesticides by pseudomonas aeruginosa as a way for creation of mutagenic compounds].
AB  - During biodegradation of pesticides there is a possibility of appearance of toxic metabolites. In this aspect oxygenation of 15 new chemical compounds possessing pesticide activity by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PS6749 was investigated. By application of the Ames test, mutagenicity of appearing products of reaction was investigated. Utilization of oxygen in presence of 11 compounds was found. Metabolites of pesticide IPO 3819-N/3,4-dimethoxybenzylidene/2-hydroxyaniline were mutagenic for a strain of Salmonella typhimurium TA 98. Oxygenation products of remaining compounds did not exhibit mutagenic activity.
TI  - Effect of sorbitan monolaurate polyoxyalkylene (Tween 20) on the ultrastructure of some bacteria.
AB  - The ultrastructure of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas pseudomallei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa treated with 0.5 and 1% Tween 20 was studied by means of transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Specific changes in the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane were observed.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro susceptibility and emergence of mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin among multidrug resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy-seven multidrug resistant clinical isolates [K. pneumoniae, (N = 87); E coli, (N = 30); Salmonella typhimurium (N = 100); P. aeruginosa, (N = 30); S. aureus, (N = 30)] from hospitalized patients specimens, were tested in vitro for sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin. Application of the disk diffusion test and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration by the microdilution method indicated that, almost all isolates were sensitive to the drug. Overall, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were the less sensitive organisms. Ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of > or = 10(-5)/CFU.
TI  - Protective effect of Salmonella typhimurium Re-LPS antiserum.
AB  - There is increasing evidence that antiserum to LPS can reduce the morbidity and mortality of Gram-negative bacterial infections. We report that antiserum to S. typhimurium SL 1102 (Re mutant strain) has excellent cross-protective activity. Antisera to these bacteria and to their Re-LPS were prepared in rabbits immunized with heat-killed bacterial cells and with Re-LPS preparations. Re-LPS antibody titers were tested by immune hemagglutination (IHA) and by ELISA. These antisera were found to be capable of protecting ICR mice against lethal challenge with S-type S. typhimurium 50014 (100 LD50), E. coli 0111:B4 (32 LD50), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 LD50) and Klebsiella pneumonia (16 LD50). We used gastric mucin (5%) as a virulence enhancing agent for the bacterial challenges. The IHA titer of antibody to the homologous strain proved to be much higher than that of other strains. Protection by the sera was 75-100%, 25% and 0% when injected 24, 48 or 72 h before the challenge, respectively. The survival rate was more than 50% when the antiserum was injected 5-7 h after challenge with a ten-fold or higher lethal dose. No protection was observed against such high challenge when the serum was injected later. According to these results, Re-LPS antiserum provides better protection than S-type specific antisera.
TI  - Effect of low concentrations of quinolone antibiotics on bacterial virulence mechanisms.
AB  - Recent studies have shown that exposure to quinolone antibiotics at or below the  minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) results in reduction in the level of production or total elimination of certain factors that contribute to the virulence of bacteria. This study was designed to determine whether low concentrations of enoxacin, lomefloxacin, and ciprofloxacin altered the morphology or affected the production of various virulence factors in several different genera of bacteria. The factors studied were nuclease and a toxin production in Staphylococcus aureus, cell size, pili and fimbriae production, and adherence of Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to urinary epithelial cells and dog bladder cells, and the major virulence factor in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In addition, the effect of growth in low levels of enoxacin on phagocytosis of S. aureus by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was studied. Following exposure to subinhibitory levels of quinolones tested, significant reduction in activity or complete elimination was seen in all of those factors measured. Minor differences were noted in the efficiency of elimination among the three quinolones tested. At as low as 1/8 MIC there is significant enhancement of phagocytic activity by human PMNs. These data suggest that exposure to quinolones at concentrations below the MIC disrupts the regulatory mechanisms that control cell morphology, adherence as well as exocellular enzyme production and plasmid maintenance. This may mean that certain virulent organisms that survive exposure to quinolone antibiotics may be less likely to produce or maintain the disease state in susceptible hosts.
TI  - Microbiological status of rabbit carcases in Egypt.
AB  - A total of 40 New Zealand white rabbits, 20 freshly slaughtered rabbits from an experimental farm and 20 processed rabbit carcases from grocery stores in Beni-Suef city, were examined bacteriologically. The mean values of aerobic plate counts at 37 degrees C and 1 degrees C, Enterobacteriaceae counts, Pseudomonas counts and Staphylococcus counts of freshly slaughtered rabbits were 10(4) +/- 2 x 10(3), 8 x 10(2) +/- 10(2), 6 x 10(2) +/- 10(2), 3 x 10(2) +/- 10(2), and 10(2) +/- 60 organisms per gram respectively, whereas the equivalent values were 8 x 10(5) +/- 3 x 10(4), 2 x 10(5) +/- 10(4), 4 x 10(4) +/- 8 x 10(3), 2 x 10(4) +/- 6 x 10(3), and 4 x 10(3) +/- 4 x 10(2) organisms per gram of processed rabbit carcases from grocery stores, respectively. The freshly slaughtered rabbits showed a low bacterial load compared with processed rabbit carcases from grocery stores. Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes could be isolated from the rabbit carcases examined in addition to Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus from processed rabbit carcases. Yersinia enterocolitica could not be isolated from any sample examined. Suggested measures to reduce the microbial load in rabbit carcases are discussed.
TI  - Identification, expression, and DNA sequence of the GDP-mannose biosynthesis genes encoded by the O7 rfb gene cluster of strain VW187 (Escherichia coli O7:K1).
AB  - The O7-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in strains of Escherichia coli consists  of a repeating unit made of galactose, mannose, rhamnose, 4-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyglucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. We have recently cloned and characterized genetically the O7-specific LPS biosynthesis region (rfbEcO7) of the E. coli O7:K1 strain VW187 (C. L. Marolda, J. Welsh, L. Dafoe, and M. A. Valvano, J. Bacteriol. 172:3590-3599, 1990). In this study, we localized the gnd gene encoding gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase at one end of the rfbEcO7 gene cluster and sequenced that end of the cluster. Three open reading frames (ORF) encoding polypeptides of 275, 464, and 453 amino acids were identified upstream of gndEcO7, all transcribed toward the gnd gene. ORF275 had 45% similarity at the protein level with ORF16.5, which occupies a similar position in the Salmonella enterica LT2 rfb region, and presumably encodes a nucleotide sugar transferase. The polypeptides encoded by ORFs 464 and 453 were expressed under the control of the ptac promoter and visualized in Coomassie blue-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and by maxicell analysis. ORF464 expressed GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase and ORF453 encoded a phosphomannomutase, the enzymes for the biosynthesis pathway of GDP-mannose, one of the nucleotide sugar precursors for the formation of the O7 repeating unit. They were designated rfbMEcO7 and rfbKEcO7, respectively. The RfbMEcO7 polypeptide was homologous to the corresponding protein in S. enterica LT2, XanB of Xanthomonas campestris, and AlgA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylases. RfbKEcO7 was very similar to CpsG of S. enterica LT2, an enzyme presumably involved in the biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharide colanic acid, but quite different from the corresponding RfbK protein of S. enterica LT2.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium,  Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida were determined; the DNA sequences of the lexA genes from these bacteria were 86%, 76%, 61% and 59% similar, respectively, to the Escherichia coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora and P. putida LexA proteins are 202 residues long whereas that of P. aeruginosa is 204. Two putative LexA repressor binding sites were localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes, the distance between them being 5 bp in S. typhimurium and E. carotovora, as in the lexA gene of E. coli, and 3 bp in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. The first lexA site present in the lexA operator of all five bacteria is very well conserved. However, the second lexA box is considerably more variable. The Ala-84--Gly-85 bond, at which the LexA repressor of E. coli is cleaved during the induction of the SOS response, is also found in the LexA proteins of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora. Likewise, the amino acids Ser-119 and Lys-156 are present in all of these three LexA repressors. These residues also exist in the LexA proteins of P. putida and P. aeruginosa, but they are displaced by 4 and 6 residues, respectively. Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of E. coli are highly conserved in the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora, P. aeruginosa and P. putida LexA proteins.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding a 21-kilodalton outer membrane protein  from Bordetella avium and expression of the gene in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Three gene libraries of Bordetella avium 197 DNA were prepared in Escherichia coli LE392 by using the cosmid vectors pCP13 and pYA2329, a derivative of pCP13 specifying spectinomycin resistance. The cosmid libraries were screened with convalescent-phase anti-B. avium turkey sera and polyclonal rabbit antisera against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. One E. coli recombinant clone produced a 56-kDa protein which reacted with convalescent-phase serum from a turkey infected with B. avium 197. In addition, five E. coli recombinant clones were identified which produced B. avium outer membrane proteins with molecular masses of 21, 38, 40, 43, and 48 kDa. At least one of these E. coli clones, which encoded the 21-kDa protein, reacted with both convalescent-phase turkey sera and antibody against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. The gene for the 21-kDa outer membrane protein was localized by Tn5seq1 mutagenesis, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. DNA sequence analysis of the 21-kDa protein revealed an open reading frame of 582 bases that resulted in a predicted protein of 194 amino acids. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the gene encoding the 21-kDa outer membrane protein with protein sequences in the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein sequence data base indicated significant homology to the OmpA proteins of Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium and to Neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane protein III, Haemophilus influenzae protein P6, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa porin protein F. The gene (ompA) encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein hybridized with 4.1-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica and with 6.0- and 3.2-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of B. avium and B. avium-like DNA, respectively. A 6.75-kb DNA fragment encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein was subcloned into the Asd+ vector pYA292, and the construct was introduced into the avirulent delta cya delta crp delta asd S. typhimurium chi 3987 for oral immunization of birds. The gene encoding the 21-kDa protein was expressed equivalently in B. avium 197, delta asd E. coli chi 6097, and S. typhimurium chi 3987 and was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane. In preliminary studies on oral inoculation of turkey poults with S. typhimurium chi 3987 expressing the gene encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein, it was determined that a single dose of the recombinant Salmonella vaccine failed to elicit serum antibodies against the 21-kDa protein and challenge with wild-type B. avium 197 resulted in colonization of the trachea and thymus with B. avium 197.
TI  - Short-term dietary lipid manipulation does not affect survival in two models of murine sepsis.
AB  - Dietary lipid manipulation has been shown to have various effects on the immune system, depending on the amount of fat, degree of saturation, and type of fat used. In this study we investigated the role of different sources of fat at different levels on the survival of mice in two models of peritonitis, one with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the other with Salmonella typhimurium. CF1 mice were pair-fed diets with 5% or 40% of total calories as fat. The source of fat used was coconut oil, oleic acid, safflower oil, or fish oil. Three other diets were tested as well, one with no fat, one with only 0.5% of total calories linoleic acid as the only source of fat, and a control diet that had 12% of total calories as corn oil. At the end of 2 weeks of feeding the experimental diets, mice were challenged with Ps aeruginosa intraperitoneally and mortality was recorded over 1 week. After 3 weeks of feeding the experimental diets, mice were challenged with S typhimurium and mortality was recorded over 2 weeks. No significant differences were seen on survival among groups fed different levels of fat, as well as different sources of fat. We conclude that, overall, 2- and 3-week manipulation of dietary fat does not affect outcome from infection in these models.
TI  - Characterization of the Shigella serotype D (S. sonnei) O polysaccharide and the  enterobacterial R1 lipopolysaccharide core by use of mouse monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - In the course of developing a live vaccine, we generated three murine monoclonal  antibodies (MAb) specific for Shigella sonnei. The specificities of these MAb were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analyses with whole cells or purified lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) as antigens. Two of them are specific for the Shigella serotype D O-polysaccharide determinant, whereas one specifically binds to the core hexose region of R1-type LPSs. With these MAb, it was possible to analyze clinical isolates and a hybrid Salmonella typhi strain for their expression of the corresponding LPS moieties. In addition to their use in the screening of candidate vaccine strains, the new MAb provide a powerful tool for epidemiological and phylogenetic studies of natural enterobacterial populations.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences and characterization of liv genes encoding components of the high-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - A 7.6-kb fragment of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 containing the liv gene cluster,  which specifies the high-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system (LIV-I), has been isolated. The upstream region contains the livB and livC genes encoding the leucine-isoleucine-valine-threonine and leucine-specific binding proteins, respectively. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the 4-kb downstream segment was determined and found to contain four reading frames, designated as livA, livE, livF, and livG, that encode putative membrane-associated proteins. The livA and livE genes encode hydrophobic proteins composed of 308 and 425 amino acid residues, respectively. The livF and livG genes encode hydrophilic proteins of 255 and 237 amino acids, respectively; both the proteins contain consensus amino acid sequences found in proteins with ATP-binding sites. These four genes linked together have a potential rho-independent transcriptional terminator adjacent to the 3'-end of livG. No promoter sequence was found in the immediate upstream region of the livAEFG cluster. The livA, livE, livF, and livG gene products were identified as proteins with apparent M(r)s of 25,500, 34,500, 28,000, and 26,000, respectively, by SDS-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis. The deduced amino acid sequences of these four proteins showed strong homology to those of the corresponding membrane-associated proteins required for the high-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport systems from both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Survival of Salmonella paratyphi B and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in seawater after  incubation or washing in the presence of osmolytes].
AB  - The authors have compared the survival in seawater of Salmonella paratyphi B and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells grown at low or high osmolarity, in the presence of organic osmolytes: glycine betaine, choline, proline, and glutamate. The four substrates enhanced the survival potential of S. paratyphi B while only glycine betaine protected P. aeruginosa. In addition only S. paratyphi B cells were more resistant after a preliminary growth at high osmolarity. Both bacteria were sensitive to osmotic down-shock, sensitization of S. paratyphi B being inversely proportional (p greater than or equal to 0.01) to the osmolarity of the medium used to wash cells. The transit in wastewater, at low osmolarity, can therefore modify the behavior of these pathogens in the marine environment.
TI  - Demonstration of cel operon expression of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at elevated temperatures refractory to their growth.
AB  - When Escherichia coli was incubated at the growth-refractory temperatures of 48 and 54 degrees C, expression of the cel operon was demonstrated by phospho-beta-glucosidase activity. This enzyme activity was also detected at the growth-refractory temperatures in Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thermotolerant and mesothermophilic mutants of E. coli, S. typhimurium, and P. aeruginosa, able to grow with generation times of 30 to 40 min at 48 and 54 degrees C, exhibited phospho-beta-glucosidase activity at their growth temperatures of 48 and 54 degrees C. Thus, the cel operon previously described as a cryptic operon in E. coli and S. typhimurium was found to be expressed at growth-refractory temperatures of the mesophilic parent and growth-permissive temperatures (48 and 54 degrees C) of the thermotolerant and mesothermophilic mutants.
TI  - Distribution of an L-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  - A protein carboxyl methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues. A similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. In this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), Rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. DNA probes from the E. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal DNA of the enteric species. Interestingly, no activity was found in the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in Rhizobium meliloti or Rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. Additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species Bacillus subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces griseus. The absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence of inhibitors in the extracts. These results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. Since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal cellular physiology.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on Staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), Salmonella typhimurium (Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re of LPS mutants) and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (209P, Cowan I, Smith diffuse and Smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and K) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. Escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, such as Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. Lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against M. lysodeikticus and B. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against S. typhimurium and S. aureus. With regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, NP1, NP4, and NP5, NP1 showed strong bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. Neither NP4 nor NP5 showed any bactericidal activity, while NP5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of NP1 against K. pneumoniae 277.
TI  - One-step cloning system for isolation of bacterial lexA-like genes.
AB  - A system to isolate lexA-like genes of bacteria directly was developed. It is based upon the fact that the presence of a lexA(Def) mutation is lethal to SulA+ cells of Escherichia coli. This system is composed of a SulA- LexA(Def) HsdR- strain and a lexA-conditional killer vector (plasmid pUA165) carrying the wild-type sulA gene of E. coli and a polylinker in which foreign DNA may be inserted. By using this method, the lexA-like genes of Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and P. putida were cloned. We also found that the LexA repressor of S. typhimurium presented the highest affinity for the SOS boxes of E. coli in vivo, whereas the LexA protein of P. aeruginosa had the lowest. Likewise, all of these LexA repressors were cleaved by the activated RecA protein of E. coli after DNA damage. Furthermore, under high-stringency conditions, the lexA gene of E. coli hybridized with the lexA genes of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora but not with those of P. aeruginosa and P. putida.
TI  - Inhibition of chemotaxis of neutrophil leukocytes to interleukin-8 by endotoxins  of various bacteria.
AB  - The effects of endotoxins from various bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhosa, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on chemotaxis of neutrophil leukocytes to formyl peptide and interleukin-8 were tested in an improved chemotaxis assay involving a "sparse-pore" polycarbonate (Nuclepore) membrane in a Boyden-type chamber. The possible chemotactic activity of the endotoxins themselves were tested by the same technique. In addition, the effects of these substances on random motility of neutrophils were tested with a corresponding assay involving similar chambers fitted with membranes of standard pore density. Possible activation of the complement system of serum by each endotoxin was tested with sheep erythrocyte assays and the maximum endotoxin concentration (100 micrograms/ml) used in the chemotaxis and motility assays. All endotoxins inhibited chemotaxis of neutrophils to interleukin-8. No endotoxin affected chemotaxis to formyl peptide or was itself chemotactic for neutrophils. Endotoxin of S. flexneri inhibited random motility of neutrophils, while the others had no such effect. Endotoxins of K. pneumoniae and of P. aeruginosa produced moderate and marked inhibition, respectively, of total complement, as measured by hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, without affecting the levels of C3c and C4 in these assays. Endotoxins of the other bacteria had no demonstrable effect in any of these assays of complement activation. These results suggest that chemotaxis to interleukin-8 may be mediated by cellular mechanisms different from those involved in chemotaxis to formyl peptide. Furthermore, the presence of these endotoxins could be significant for the suppression of neutrophil accumulation in inflammatory lesions mediated by interleukin-8.
TI  - [The immunogenicity of mono- and associated vaccines made from strains of opportunistic bacteria].
AB  - In experiments on white mice the immunogenic potency of two variants of combined  vaccines prepared from strains of opportunistic bacteria was compared with that of monovaccines used as the components of the combined vaccines. All the vaccines under study were found highly immunogenic. Decrease of monovaccine share in the combined vaccine did not reduce the immunogenic potency to any of the strains. An 8- to 16-fold increase in the level of specific antibodies in the colostric lactosera of cows immunized with combined vaccines was observed, and the survival rate of newborn calves increased 3- to 4-fold.
TI  - [The adhesion of pathogenic microflora on carbon sorbents].
AB  - The adsorbing activity of granulated carbonic sorbents SKN and KAU, as well as their oxidated forms, containing protogenic carboxylic and phenolic groups with respect to Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenic strains has been studied. As shown in this study, the process of interaction between microorganisms and carbonic sorbents has two stages. At the first stage the main role is played by long-distance electrostatic forces and at the second stage, by Van der Waals short-distance forces, as well as bonds formed between cell structures and surface groupings of carbonaceous materials. In the mechanism of interaction between microbial cells and carbons the geometry of carbon surface plays an important role. KAU(0)-1 exhibits the highest degree of adhesion with respect to pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Transmembrane diffusion of hydrophobic antimicrobial agents and cell surface hydrophobicity in Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The transmembrane diffusion of hydrophobic antimicrobial agents, e.g. lincomycin  and clindamycin, was examined in Bacteroides fragilis which is sensitive to these agents. The results showed that these agents penetrate efficiently through the outer membrane. Cell surface hydrophobicity measured by the partition assay between water and p-xylene revealed that the cell surface of B. fragilis is more hydrophobic than that of Salmonella typhimurium or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, treatment with low concentrations of surfactant caused cell lysis. These results suggest that the cell surface hydrophobicity in B. fragilis plays an important role in the efficient transmembrane penetration of hydrophobic compounds. This efficiency explains the susceptibility of B. fragilis to hydrophobic antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Enzymatically deacylated Neisseria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibits murine splenocyte mitogenesis induced by LPS.
AB  - Acyloxyacyl hydrolase is a leukocyte enzyme that selectively removes the secondary acyl chains from the lipid A moiety of gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). As predicted by the reported contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of lipid A analogs, enzymatic deacylation of Salmonella typhimurium Rc LPS substantially reduces its potency in the dermal Shwartzman reaction and in several in vitro assays that measure responses of human endothelial cells and neutrophils, whereas the potency of this LPS for inducing murine splenocyte mitogenesis is affected much less. In the experiments described here, we studied the impact of acyloxyacyl hydrolysis on the bioactivities of several LPS that differ from Salmonella LPS in carbohydrate and lipid A structures. Deacylated LPS from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and S. typhimurium were similarly reduced in potency in the Limulus lysate test (30- to 60-fold reduction in potency relative to the corresponding mock-treated LPS), and the ability of all of these deacylated LPS to stimulate neutrophil adherence to human endothelial cells was reduced by a factor of 100 or more. For LPS from E. coli, H. influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the impact of deacylation on spleen cell mitogenesis was also similar to that observed for S. typhimurium LPS: deacylation reduced potency by less than 15-fold. Unexpectedly, the potency of Neisseria LPS in the murine splenocyte mitogenicity test was reduced over 100-fold by deacylation, and deacylated Neisseria LPS could block the mitogenic activity of Neisseria and Salmonella LPS. These studies indicate that the contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of a given LPS cannot be predicted with confidence from the reported structure-activity relationships of lipid A or from the behavior of other deacylated LPS.
TI  - ["Masked" autoantibodies from the serum of healthy blood donors cross-reacting with DNA and bacterial lipopolysaccharides].
AB  - The "masked" autoantibodies with polyspecific activity were found in the serum of healthy donors. It is shown that these antibodies are able to react with antigens after the ion exchange chromatography with QAE-sephadex. It was found that these "masked" antibodies are able to cross-react with DNA and lipopolysaccharides of wide-spread species of bacteria. The possible role of these antibodies as in protection of organism from the external antigens as in the origin of autoimmune diseases is discussed.
TI  - Antigenic homology among gram-negative organisms isolated from cattle with clinical mastitis.
AB  - This study examined the degree of serologic homology among mastitis pathogens. Antibodies were raised against the Rc mutant, Escherichia coli O111:B4 (strain J5) and affinity purified against lipopolysaccharide derived from the Ra mutant, Salmonella typhimurium TV119. These antibodies reacted with a battery of unrelated Gram-negative bacteria in whole cell ELISA. Bacteria with strong cross-reactions included a heterologous, smooth E. coli, Salmonella dublin, S. typhimurium, Salmonella newport, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recognition of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchisepticum was observed, but reactions were weaker than with the other isolates. The reduced recognition of these isolates probably reflects a masking effect of the bacterial capsule and variations in lipopolysaccharide structure. The polyclonal antibody did not recognize a Gram-positive isolate, Staphylococcus aureus. These immunoglobulins were then tested using whole cell ELISA against a panel of bacteria recovered from the mammary glands of cattle with clinical mastitis. Marked reactivity was noted against a variety of Gram-negative pathogens. Gram-positive isolates had lower recognition by Gram-negative core antigen specific immunoglobulin. The results suggest immunization with rough mutant bacteria may have broad application in the prevention of coliform mastitis.
TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alone does not explain the lethal effect of lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Lethality and tumor necrosis factor production induced by different types of lipopolysaccharide were studied in naive (non-primed) rats during the late phase of endotoxin tolerance. The correlation with antilipopolysaccharide antibodies was also analyzed. No correlation was found between tumor necrosis factor levels and lipopolysaccharide-induced mortality in naive animals. Low-toxicity lipopolysaccharide preparations induced levels of tumor necrosis factor similar to those induced with more toxic types of lipopolysaccharide. Late tolerance was associated with progressively lower levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor and increasing titers of antilipopolysaccharide antibodies after repeated injections of homologous lipopolysaccharide. During late endotonxin tolerance, a direct correlation between the lipopolysaccharide dose and peak tumor necrosis factor serum levels was found. We conclude that since tumor necrosis factor serum levels do not correlate with mortality, tumor necrosis factor alone cannot explain the lethal effect of lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - Sensitivity of bacteria to NaNO2 and to L-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages.
AB  - Sensitivity of bacteria to NO2-/NO and to L-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages was tested. The growth of all bacteria tested, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, was significantly inhibited by NaNO2 at the concentration of 5 to 10 mM. However, L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism of LPS-activated murine macrophages was ineffective in killing these bacteria. It seems that the concentration of NO2-/NO in phagolysosome in the activated macrophages is insufficient to kill the bacteria in situ. We concluded that L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism can hardly work on bacteria killing in activated macrophages.
TI  - Prolonged environmental stress via a two step process selects mutants of Escherichia, Salmonella and Pseudomonas that grow at 54 degrees C.
AB  - A prolonged incubation of Escherichia, Salmonella or Pseudomonas at 48 degrees C  with nalidixic acid selected mutants (T48) able to grow at 48 degrees C. A prolonged incubation at 54 degrees C of the T48 mutants selected mutants (T54) able to grow at 54 degrees C. These mutants were susceptible to the same bacteriophages as the original mesophilic strains. Auxotrophic phenotypes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium mesophilic parents were demonstrated by these mutants if they were cultivated on minimal agar with cellobiose at 48 degrees C or 54 degrees C or on a minimal agar with glucose at 37 degrees C. The T48 alleles mapped in the gyrA region of E. coli or S. typhimurium chromosome. In S. typhimurium the T54 alleles, which permit growth at 54 degrees C, were shown by cotransductional analysis to be linked to gyrA.
TI  - [Methodological and clinical evaluation of a microplate assay of endotoxin in whole blood sample].
AB  - We have developed a simple, rapid method for determining endotoxin in whole blood using a microtiter plate. The samples were pretreated with 0.66 mol/l nitric acid containing 0.25% Triton X-100; the supernatants were placed in a microtiter plate well, and incubated with endotoxin-specific chromogenic limulus test reagent (Endospecy; Seikagaku Corporation). The calibration curve was linear from 0 to 50 pg/ml of Escherichia coli 0111: B4 endotoxin with a variation coefficient less than 5%. The recovery of endotoxin added to human and experimental animals was about 100% without being affected by dilution. The normal endotoxin level in human whole blood was less than 10 pg/ml in reference to E. coli 0111: B4 endotoxin. The results in 120 patients with various diseases correlated well with those determined by a conventional method using plasma as a sample (r = 0.877; p less than 0.05). Whole blood sample has advantages over plasma in that it allows all endotoxin in a sample to be determined, requires a smaller amount of sample, and has less risk of contamination.
TI  - Mechanisms of zidovudine resistance in bacteria.
AB  - Unlike their parent strains, zidovudine-resistant derivatives of Escherichia coli KL16 and Salmonella typhimurium NCTC 5710 were found to be incapable of incorporating radiolabelled thymidine into their chromosomal DNA. Since incorporation was still prevented in the presence of EDTA, resistance to zidovudine was not associated with a permeability barrier, but appeared to result from the loss of thymidine kinase activity, required for the phosphorylation of zidovudine. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, was also shown to be incapable of incorporating thymidine into its DNA, but Staphylococcus epidermidis SK360 and Staph. aureus E3T, which are also intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, possessed thymidine kinase activity. This suggests that two distinct mechanisms of resistance to zidovudine exist in bacteria. Zidovudine resistance did not appear to confer resistance to other antibacterial agents.
TI  - An investigation of indirect conductimetry for detection of some food-borne bacteria.
AB  - Indirect conductimetry using a rapid automated bacterial impedance technique was  investigated. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Salmonella spp. grown in Whitley Impedance broth all elicited indirect conductimetric changes. These indirect conductance responses were improved by the addition of 2 g/l glucose to the medium and resulted in maximum changes of 2340-4300 microS with associated maximum rates of change of 520-1210 microS/h. Furthermore, the indirect conductimetric assay detected growth of staphylococci, listeria and salmonella in media containing high concentrations of salts used as selective agents in culture media for the isolation of these organisms.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the ponB gene, encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B of Escherichia coli, in heterologous systems.
AB  - A fragment from the ponB region of the Escherichia coli chromosome comprising the promoterless sequence encoding penicillin-binding protein 1B (PBP 1B) has been cloned in a broad-host-range expression vector under the control of the kanamycin resistance gene promoter present in the vector. The hybrid plasmid (pJP3) was used to transform appropriate strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In all instances, the coding sequence was expressed in the heterologous hosts, yielding a product with electrophoretic mobility, protease accessibility, membrane location, and beta-lactam-binding properties identical to those of native PBP 1B in E. coli. These results indicated that PBP 1B of E. coli is compatible with the cytoplasmic membrane environment of unrelated bacterial species and support the idea that interspecific transfer of mutated alleles of genes coding for PBPs could potentially be an efficient spreading mechanism for intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams.
TI  - Comparison of endotoxins and cutaneous burn toxin as immunosuppressants.
AB  - Endotoxins of E. coli, S. typhosa and Ps. aeruginosa were injected i.p. into mice a few days before administration of the antigen sheep erythrocytes (SE). Antibody-forming cells (AFC) to SE were later enumerated in relation to dose of endotoxin given. In comparison a toxic lipid protein isolated from burned skin (cutaneous burn toxin or CBT) was similarly applied and found to be more inhibitory of the immune response than any of the three endotoxins. Considering the 50 per cent inhibitory doses on a molar basis CBT was found to be 1000 fold more immunosuppressive than the most inhibitory endotoxin. As the immune suppression which follows severe thermal injury involves failure of interleukin 2 (IL2) function, as a critical index of survival, the CBT was tested for its effects on the culture of a human IL2-dependent cell line in the presence of IL2. CBT inhibited the growth of these cells, however, endotoxin had no effect on their proliferation. Thus CBT, which arises by a thermally induced polymerization of skin lipid protein, is specific to burn injury and has a direct inhibitory effect on the immune response.
TI  - Distribution of alginate gene sequences in the Pseudomonas rRNA homology group I-Azomonas-Azotobacter lineage of superfamily B procaryotes.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA from group I Pseudomonas species, Azotobacter vinelandii, Azomonas macrocytogens, Xanthomonas campestris, Serpens flexibilis, and three enteric bacteria was screened for sequences homologous to four Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate (alg) genes (algA, pmm, algD, and algR1). All the group I Pseudomonas species tested (including alginate producers and nonproducers) contained sequences homologous to all the P. aeruginosa alg genes used as probes, with the exception of P. stutzeri, which lacked algD. Azotobacter vinelandii also contained sequences homologous to all the alg gene probes tested, while Azomonas macrocytogenes DNA showed homology to all but algD. X. campestris contained sequences homologous to pmm and algR1 but not to algA or algD. The helical bacterium S. flexibilis showed homology to the algR1 gene, suggesting that an environmentally responsive regulatory gene similar to algR1 exists in S. flexibilis. Escherichia coli showed homology to the algD and algR1 genes, while Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to show homology with any of the P. aeruginosa alg genes. Since all the organisms tested are superfamily B procaryotes, these results suggest that within superfamily B, the alginate genes are distributed throughout the Pseudomonas group I-Azotobacter-Azomonas lineage, while only some alg genes have been retained in the Pseudomonas group V (Xanthomonas) and enteric lineages.
TI  - Monocytes in cystic fibrosis: responsiveness to microbial stimuli.
AB  - Peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from 19 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and age-matched paired normal individuals. The oxidative metabolic response of these cells was measured by superoxide anion production before and after stimulation with Salmonella typhimurium or Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CF monocytes showed slightly greater spontaneous superoxide anion production (14.1 +/- 2.1 SEM nanomoles superoxide anion/10(6) monocytes/180 min; n = 12) than normal monocytes (9.5 +/- 1.4; n = 12), P = 0.009. No differences between CF and normals were found in LPS-stimulated superoxide anion production (CF = 33.5 +/- 4.6, n = 13; normal = 33.8 +/- 4.2, n = 13). Furthermore, CF monocytes responded to both P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium LPS stimulation as well as to recombinant interferon-gamma. Superoxide anion production of CF monocytes was comparable in autologous serum and in normal serum, and responses of patients colonized with P. aeruginosa and P. cepacia did not differ. We conclude that CF monocytes have a slightly increased metabolic level and, despite chronic infection, are capable of a further response to exogenous microbial stimuli.
TI  - Antimicrobial spectrum of lignin-related pine cone extracts of Pinus parviflora Sieb. et Zucc.
AB  - Pine cones of Pinus parviflora Sieb., et Zucc, were extracted successively with 5% NaHCO3, 3% NH4OH, 1% NaOH and 4% NaOH, and the extracts were tested for ability to induce antimicrobial activity in mice infected with Staphylococcal aureus. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, or Salmonella enteritidis. These alkaline extracts were potent against the first 5 of these strains of microorganisms, and the activity was recovered mostly from their acid-precipitates at pH 5. After further fractionation on a Sephadex LH-60 column, the highest molecular weight fraction was most potent. Chemical structures in these bioactive fractions were assumed to be lignin-related structures, based on spectral data from UV, NMR and IR spectroscopy.
TI  - Ultrastructural changes in some pathogenic bacteria after treatment with ethylendiamintetraacetic acid.
AB  - The ultrastructure of Pseudomonas pseudomallei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Yersinia  pseudotuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes was studied after treatment with EDTA. The study established that the most sensitive species were: Pseudomonas pseudomallei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the case of Listeria monocytogenes changes were not observed. Typical ultrastructural changes in the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane were established by means of ultrathin sections, as well as with scanning electron microscopy of Pseudomonas pseudomallei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo (LD50) effects of human lactoferrin on bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo effects of human lactoferrin (LF), apoLF, iron saturated LF and of different iron containing compounds (ferric chloride, ferric sodium citrate) were studied on Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi-murium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa reference and wild-type strains with well-defined virulence markers (i.e. enterochelin, aerobactin production). LF exert in vitro antibacterial effect, and iron-free Vogel-Bonner medium proved to be suitable for its determination. The effect of intraperitoneally administered LF could not be evaluated because of its aspecificity, as any treatment (e.g. saline, Ringer solution) before bacterial challenge activated macrophages. In contrast to the in vitro results, intramuscular challenge failed to inhibit bacterial growth in vivo, as siderophores produced by bacteria were able to acquire lactoferrin-bound iron. LF treatment, like iron addition, enhanced the virulence of bacteria in mice, whereas apoLF - using iron present in the body fluids - turned to LF being unable to acquire siderophore-bound iron from bacteria. These findings do not support the literary view that LF would be useful as an antimicrobial drug.
TI  - Preliminary studies of the effect of ozone on the bactericidal properties of complement.
AB  - The study analyzes the bactericidal influence of an ozonized blood serum on gram-negative bacilli. Considerable differences were observed concerning the effect which ozonized normal human serum has upon Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Salmonella strains. It was found that the impact may vary depending not only on the time of the exposure of serum to ozone, but also on the type of strain and the structure of the outer membrane of the bacteria. The Salmonella typhimurium strain of the Ra chemotype treated with the serum which was exposed to ozone showed higher susceptibility to the action of complement than the S. typhimurium strain of the S chemotype.
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo toxicity of T-2 toxin, a Fusarium mycotoxin, to mouse peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - The effects of T-2 toxin on mouse peritoneal macrophages were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy of macrophages treated in vitro with T-2 toxin revealed retraction of pseudopodia. Protein synthesis was inhibited after in vitro contact with T-2 toxin but was not affected 24 h after injection of a sublethal dose of toxin into mice. There was reduction in the phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa when macrophages were exposed in vitro to T-2 toxin and when mice were injected with T-2 toxin. Clearance of colloidal carbon was not modified after T-2 toxin injection, whereas spleen weight was decreased 24 h after T-2 injection. T-2 toxin enhanced the mortality of mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium C5S when it was administered 24 h prior to oral challenge with the bacterium.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against flagellar antigen of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Two hybrid cell clones secreting monoclonal antibodies against flagellar antigen  isolated from Salmonella typhi, were produced and characterized. The antibodies bound specifically to the flagellar strain of S. typhi and did not show any reactivity with a flagellar S. typhi or with flagellar strains of S. dublin, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, S. typhimurium, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The antibodies recognized a determinant present on a group of proteins migrating between 45 Kd and 60 Kd. These monoclonal antibodies would be useful reagents for clinical and epidemiological studies.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - In vitro synthesis of a lipid-linked trisaccharide involved in synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen.
AB  - The heteropolysaccharide chains of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) are made  up of linear trisaccharide repeat units with the structure----3)-alpha-D-Fuc4NAc-(1----4)- beta-D-ManNAcA-(1----4)-alpha-D-GlcNAc-(1----, where Fuc4NAc is 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose, ManNAcA is N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid, and GlcNAc is N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The assembly of these chains involves lipid-linked intermediates, and both GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (lipid I) and ManNAcA-GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (lipid II) are intermediates in ECA biosynthesis. In this study we demonstrated that lipid II serves as the acceptor of Fuc4NAc residues in the assembly of the trisaccharide repeat unit of ECA chains. Incubation of Escherichia coli membranes with UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-[14C]ManNAcA, and TDP-[3H]Fuc4NAc resulted in the synthesis of a radioactive glycolipid (lipid III) that contained both [14C]ManNAcA and [3H]Fuc4NAc. The oligosaccharide moiety of lipid III was identified as a trisaccharide by gel-permeation chromatography, and the in vitro synthesis of lipid III was dependent on prior synthesis of lipids I and II. Accordingly, the incorporation of [3H]Fuc4NAc into lipid III from the donor TDP-[3H]Fuc4NAc was dependent on the presence of both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-ManNAcA in the reaction mixtures. In addition, the in vitro synthesis of lipid III was abolished by tunicamycin. Direct conversion of lipid II to lipid III was demonstrated in two-stage reactions in which membranes were initially incubated with UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-[14C]ManNAcA to allow the synthesis of radioactive lipid II. Subsequent addition of TDP-Fuc4Nac to the washed membranes resulted in almost complete conversion of radioactive lipid II to lipid III. The in vitro synthesis of lipid III was also accompanied by the apparent utilization of this lipid intermediate for the assembly of ECA heteropolysaccharide chains. Incubation of membranes with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, UDP-ManNAcA, and TDP-Fuc4NAc resulted in the apparent incorporation of isotope into ECA polymers, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. In addition, the in vitro incorporation of [3H]Fuc4NAc into ECA heteropolysaccharide chains was demonstrated with ether-treated cells that were prepared from delta rfbA mutants of Salmonella typhimurium. These mutants are defective in the synthesis of TDP-Fuc4NAc; as a consequence, they are also defective in the synthesis of lipid III and they accumulate lipid II. Accordingly, incubation of ether-permeabilized cells of delta rfbA mutants with TDP-[3h]Fuc4NAc resulted in the incorporation of isotope into both lipid III and ECA heteropolysaccharide chains.
TI  - Saccharides of seven Pseudomonas aeruginosa immunotypes.
AB  - The structures of O-specific polysaccharides obtained by mild acid degradation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from seven Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fisher's immunotypes have been studied. The polysaccharides consist mainly of monoamino and diamino sugars, frequently also carrying acidic functions. Some of the sugars were detected in nature for the first time in these organisms. The structures of the O-specific polysaccharides of the immunotypes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are identical to those of the polysaccharides of the 011; 0(2a)2c; 01; 010a, 10b and 07a, 7d Lanyi-Bergan serological subgroups respectively, whereas no analogues have been found for the immunotypes 1 and 7. Some cross-reactions between the LPS of different immunotypes were observed in passive haemagglutination tests; the results of inhibition of passive haemagglutination and agar gel immunoprecipitation point, however, to a specificity of the LPS. Many of the LPS of the seven Pseudomonas aeruginosa immunotypes manifest rather a high cross-protective activity in active immunization tests in mice. The nature of the cross-protective activity of the LPS is discussed.
TI  - Rapid enumeration of viable bacteria by image analysis.
AB  - A direct viable counting method for enumerating viable bacteria was modified and  made compatible with image analysis. A comparison was made between viable cell counts determined by the spread plate method and direct viable counts obtained using epifluorescence microscopy either manually or by automatic image analysis. Cultures of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated at 35 degrees C in a dilute nutrient medium containing nalidixic acid. Filtered samples were stained for epifluorescence microscopy and analysed manually as well as by image analysis. Cells enlarged after incubation were considered viable. The viable cell counts determined using image analysis were higher than those obtained by either the direct manual count of viable cells or spread plate methods. The volume of sample filtered or the number of cells in the original sample did not influence the efficiency of the method. However, the optimal concentration of nalidixic acid (2.5-20 micrograms ml-1) and length of incubation (4-8 h) varied with the culture tested. The results of this study showed that under optimal conditions, the modification of the direct viable count method in combination with image analysis microscopy provided an efficient and quantitative technique for counting viable bacteria in a short time.
TI  - Enhanced bactericidal activity of macrophages by exogenous leukotriene B4.
AB  
TI  - Augmentation of resistance of mice to bacterial infection by a polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) extracted from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - A water-soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) was prepared from heat-killed Lactobacillus casei by digesting the bacteria with N-acetylmuramidase. The molecular weight of PSPG was over 30,000, and the polysaccharide portion of PSPG, its main component was composed of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, glucosamine and galactosamine. Mice pretreated intraperitoneally with PSPG survived after a lethal infection with Listeria monocytogenes or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The growth of infecting bacteria (L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli) in both the peritoneal cavity and the liver was inhibited markedly in the mice that had been treated with PSPG. It was suggested that macrophages may be the main effector for the anti-infectious effect of PSPG since treatment of mice with carrageenan, a selective macrophage blocker, markedly reduced the anti-infectious effect of PSPG.
TI  - Effect of date extract on growth and spore germination of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Berhi date extract was studied for its effect on the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. From 80 to 99% inhibition was observed in nutrient broth cultures containing 20% (w/v) date extract. Spore germination of B. subtilis was inhibited completely using various concentrations of date extract. Cell elongation and depression in the cell wall of B. subtilis were seen by scanning electron microscopy as a result of incubation in a growth medium containing dates.
TI  - Effect of small cationic leukocyte peptides (defensins) on the permeability barrier of the outer membrane.
AB  - Defensins are small cationic antibacterial peptides that are abundant in polymorphonuclear leukocytes from human and other sources (T. Ganz, M. Selsted, D. Szklarek, S. Harwig, K. Daher, D. F. Bainton, and R. J. Lehrer, J. Clin. Invest. 76:1427-1435, 1985). We studied whether subinhibitory concentrations of defensins increase the outer membrane (OM) permeability of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to hydrophobic probes, as do many other polycations that have been studied previously. Throughout the study, we used polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) as a reference peptide. PMBN has a known potent OM permeability-increasing action. As a sharp contrast to PMBN, subinhibitory concentrations of defensins did not permeabilize (or, under some test conditions, permeabilized very slightly) the OM to the probes that were used (rifampin and Triton X-100). At bacteriostatic or bactericidal defensin concentrations, some degree of synergism with rifampin was seen.
TI  - Changes in hepatic superoxide dismutase and xanthine oxidase activity in mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Liver xanthine oxidase (XOD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were compared in mice during Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. We observed that XOD activity rose but SOD activity fell for the first 11 days after infection with smooth type S. typhimurium, coinciding with the period of bacterial growth in the liver. Rough type S. typhimurium did not establish an infection and mice inoculated with this strain showed no variation in enzyme activities. P. aeruginosa infection was mild but stimulated both XOD and SOD activities.
TI  - [Structure of the O-specific polysaccharides and the protective activity of the lipopolysaccharides in Pseudomonas aeruginosa of 7 immunotypes (after Fisher)].
AB  - The structure of O-specific polysaccharides and the protective activity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) obtained from seven P. aeruginosa immunotypes (according to Fisher's classification) have been studied. The structure of O-specific polysaccharides, immunotypes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, is identical to that of polysaccharides of serotypes 011; 0(2a), 2c; 01; 010a, 10b; 07a, 7d respectively. No structural analogs of O-polysaccharide characteristic of immunotypes 1 and 7 have been detected among serotypes classified according to the scheme of Lanyi-Bergan-Akatova-Smirnova. The specific character of O-polysaccharides is confirmed by the results of the passive hemagglutination inhibition test, but the data of the passive hemagglutination test indicate that LPS of different immunotypes are antigenically related. As revealed in experiments on the active immunization of mice, LPS of seven immunotypes possess more or less pronounced cross protective properties. The causes of the cross protective activity observed in experiments with these LPS are discussed.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - [A new sensitivity test for substances used as antiseptics or disinfectants. I. Biological studies].
AB  - In this first article, the authors present a fast method of determining the bactericide and bacteriostatic power of the germs, based on the disparition of the succino-dehydrogenase activity of a bacterium, objectified by a neotetrazolium chloride reaction. This reaction allows a colorimetric qualitative and quantitative determination of the activity of a preparation and the duration of its contact with the bacteria. This method allows a study in electronic microscopy which will be published in a second article.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of human sera with a physiologic or genetic defect of the complement system.
AB  - The serum of patient suffering genetically conditioned C2 defect showed a weak bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Out of 23 tested strains one was susceptible comparing with 16 ones sensitive to normal human serum. The normal cord serum exerted a bactericidal effect on 8 strains. All sera were found to be active against Salmonella strains tested.
TI  - Survival of pathogenic bacteria in environmental microcosms.
AB  - The survival times of Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae in natural soil and river water samples were monitored by using various differential media. S. aureus and V. cholerae failed to survive in samples of soil, groundwater, and river water with various degrees of eutrophication. The population of the introduced S. enteritidis remained fairly constant in all three samples of soils tested. In water samples, numbers of S. enteritidis and P. aeruginosa showed an initial rapid decline followed by a much lower rate of decrease. The results indicated that some allochthonous microorganisms, because of their insensitivity to various biotic and abiotic stresses, might persist for a long time in the environment and become a serious threat to public health.
TI  - [Titration curves of beta-lactamases using pH gradient electrophoresis].
AB  - The molecular relationships of two types of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, TEM-1 (R 111), TEM-2 (RP 4) and OXA-1 (RGN 238), OXA-4 (pMG 90) were analysed by combined isoelectrofocusing-electrophoresis. Titration curves of TEM-1 (pI 5.4) and TEM-2 (pI 5.6) together were consistent with the known substitution of a glutamic acid in the former by a lysin in the latter. When OXA-1 (pI 7.4) and OXA-4 (pI 7.45) were titrated, one single mobility curve was obtained reflecting their structural homogeneity. The titration curve technique will be usefull for the study of structure of beta-lactamases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide: association of cross-genus reactivity with lipid A specificity.
AB  - Somatic cell hybrids secreting monoclonal antibodies against the core-glycolipid  portion of enterobacterial endotoxin were derived from mice immunized with Escherichia coli J5 or Salmonella minnesota R595 heat-killed organisms or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Eight antibodies were selected for their ability to cross-react with several members of a panel of gram-negative bacterial antigens in a radioimmunoassay. This panel represented five genera and two families of organisms: E. coli O111:B4, E. coli O55:B5, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella minnesota, and Serratia marcescens. The binding sites for six of the antibodies were unequivocally localized within the lipid A moiety of the endotoxin molecule by using the radioimmunoassay on LPS and free lipid A. The anti-lipid A antibodies were further characterized for their ability to interact with LPS variants by using a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunostaining procedure. The monoclonal antibodies bound almost exclusively to the low-molecular-weight species of LPS on the polyacrylamide gel. These components corresponded to LPS isolated from rough strains of organisms (strains which lack O-specific carbohydrate). These results suggested that the cross-reactive component of antisera raised against rough mutants of gram-negative bacteria contain antibodies of lipid A specificity. Moreover, the determinant within the lipid A moiety of LPS may have been accessible to the monoclonal antibodies only in those endotoxin molecules on the outer membrane surface which lack the O-specific carbohydrate.
TI  - Effect of slime extract from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on cell mediated immunity induced in mice by Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Immunity of mice intraperitoneally treated with slime extract and 24 h later intravenously immunized with live Salmonella typhimurium cells, was studied. The induced immunity was evaluated by determining the number of bacteria in the spleens and mortality of the animals. Slime extract in the dose of 200 micrograms/mice was found to suppress the immunity which manifested itself by enhanced proliferation of bacterial in the spleens and increased mortality as compared to control animals. The experiments on passive transfer of immunity against Salmonella typhimurium infection by splenocytes of slime extract-treated animals and then immunized, with those bacteria, revealed suppressive effect of the extract on transfer of the immunity. Similar results were obtained when splenocytes of mice sensitized with Salmonella typhimurium were given to animals pretreated with slime extract. The results obtained suggest the possibility of transfer of suppressive activity of splenocytes from slime extract-treated mice, to normal animals.
TI  - Neutralization and lipoprotein binding of lipopolysaccharides in tolerant rabbit  serum.
AB  - We examined the ability of sera drawn from rabbits made tolerant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli O18 to inhibit heterologous LPS-induced gelation of Limulus lysate. Compared with a pool of pretolerant sera, a pool of tolerant sera from these rabbits neutralized 5.5-fold more LPS from Salmonella typhimurium, 4.9-fold more LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 10.0-fold more LPS from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Because previous studies have found that LPS bound to lipoprotein is less toxic than unbound LPS, we also studied the binding of LPS lipoprotein fractions in the serum pools by using fractionation with a cesium chloride-equilibrium density gradient. Radiolabeled LPS from E. coli O113 bound much more rapidly to lipoprotein fractions in tolerant serum than in pretolerant serum (after 11 min of incubation, 66.1% vs. 16.5% binding, respectively).
TI  - Late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  - We described previously (W.M. Shafer, L.E. Martin, and J.K. Spitznagel, Infect. Immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37K CAP) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). In this investigation, we prepared 37K CAP from PMN granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. At concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37K CAP exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria included Acinetobacter lwoffii, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei. However, at 5 micrograms of 37K CAP per ml, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. The bactericidal activity of 37K CAP was greatest in acidic (pH 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (pH 7.5) media. The level of S. typhimurium resistance to 37K CAP correlated with the presence of O antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. In the absence of O antigen repeat units, resistance was proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. These results suggest that 37K CAP may contribute significantly to the ability of PMN to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.
TI  - Growth of salmonellas in different enrichment media.
AB  - The usefulness of selenite-F (S-F), tetrathionate (MKT) and Rappaport-10 (R-10) broths as enrichment media to support growth of salmonellas either alone or in the presence of other competing organisms was studied. Their ability to support the growth of stressed salmonellas from water was also investigated. It was observed that R-10 was more inhibitory to competing organisms than MKT and S-F. It strongly inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris though not of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. It was more toxic, however, to small numbers of salmonellas than MKT and S-F. Tetrathionate was strongly inhibitory for E. coli and Ent. aerogenes but much less so for Proteus and Pseudomonas species. Selenite-F was much less inhibitory than MKT to Ps. aeruginosa and it did not inhibit growth of E. coli and Ent. aerogenes as much as MKT. Salmonellas were inhibited by all three enrichment media and none of them is ideally suited for direct use. Of the three media, R-10 was much more inhibitory to stressed organisms than S-F or MKT.
TI  - Factors responsible for increased susceptibility of mice to intestinal colonization after treatment with streptomycin.
AB  - Streptomycin sulfate (5 mg/ml) was added to the drinking water of Swiss white mice. After treatment for 1 week, the mice were challenged orogastrically with 10(8) Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells. The organism failed to multiply in the intestinal tract of either treated or untreated animals, but could be recovered from contents and tissues after 48 h. In a previous study, Salmonella typhimurium was shown to multiply in the intestines of streptomycin-treated but not untreated mice when 10(3) organisms were used as inoculum. Streptomycin administration had little effect on Eh, protein or carbohydrate concentrations of cecal contents, or intestinal motility. However, it caused a statistically significant increase in water content and pH of contents and a decrease in the concentrations of acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids. S. typhimurium multiplied in pooled cecal contents obtained from both streptomycin-treated and untreated animals, but its multiplication rate and total populations were significantly greater in contents from treated animals. P. aeruginosa did not multiply in contents from either treated or untreated mice. Similar results were obtained when the organisms were inoculated into nutrient broth adjusted to simulate the pH levels and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in cecal contents of treated and untreated mice. The addition of brain heart infusion broth to cecal contents from untreated animals, in concentrations that support multiplication of S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa, did not reverse inhibition. The addition of VFA to cecal contents from treated animals to equal the concentration in cecal contents from untreated animals caused inhibition of a magnitude observed in cecal contents from untreated animals. The results indicate that VFA operating at the pH level of cecal contents of conventional mice inhibit the multiplication of both S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa and restrict colonization of the intestine by these organisms. The decrease in VFA concentrations that occurs as a result of streptomycin administration adequately explains the increased susceptibility of treated mice to colonization with S. typhimurium. It does not explain the increased susceptibility of treated mice to P. aeruginosa colonization, however.

TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - Growth kinetics of mixed culture in salmonella enrichment media.
AB  - A technique for investigating the kinetics of salmonella enrichment is reported.  Its use with four enrichment media (Rappaport's medium, Muller-Kauffmann tetrathionate broth (MKT) tetrathionate broth and selenite F) is described and the effect of elevated temperature on the growth kinetics shown. Rappaport's medium at 37 degrees C and MKT at either 37 degrees C or 42 degrees C were far superior to selenite F and tetrathionate broth in their selective properties and, with the exception of Rappaport's medium, the use of elevated temperature increased the selectivity of the media.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination in severe infections in adults].
AB  - Timentin (ticarcillin (TCR) + clavulanic acid (AC)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). Infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). The following bacteria were recovered: 10 Escherichia coli, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Providencia stuartii, 1 Salmonella typhi, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. The sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (MICs determined by agar dilution: TCR + AC 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; TCR + AC 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). Thirteen strains were susceptible to TCR (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, and 1 S. aureus) were resistant to TCR (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. Timentin was given in one-hour IV infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g X 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g X 2) in 6. Duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). At termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [HR 810 (cefpirome). Experimental evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo antibiotic activity of a new amino-2-thiazole methoxy- imino cephalosporin].
AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new amino thiazole cephalosporin whose specific characteristic is a cyclopentenopyridinium group in position 3 of the cephem nucleus. This structure is responsible for a broad spectrum of activity, covering Enterobacteriaceae, including cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group D Streptococci.
TI  - [Effect of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (timentin) combination on bacteria resistant to ticarcillin].
AB  - Sixty-nine ticarcillin-resistant strains (57 Gram negative bacilli and 12 S. aureus) were tested: MICs and MBCs were determined for clavulanic acid, ticarcillin, and both agents combined using a liquid micromethod. MICs were compared to results of disk antibiotic sensitivity tests. While clavulanic acid exhibits little antibacterial activity, its action is synergistic with that of ticarcillin making 100% of Staphylococci and 84.2% of Gram negative bacilli susceptible. Among the Gram negative bacilli tested, distribution is as follows: E. coli (9/9), Klebsiella (10/14), Enterobacter (1/3), Serratia (8/8), Proteus, Providencia (8/8), Salmonella (2/2), Acinetobacter (4/4), and Pseudomonas (6/9). Although strong bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities are already achieved with 4 mg, the best results are obtained with timentin 8 mg.
TI  - Ion selectivity of gram-negative bacterial porins.
AB  - Twelve different porins from the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia pestis were reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes. Most of the porins, except outer membrane protein P, formed large, water-filled, ion-permeable channels with a single-channel conductance between 1.5 and 6 nS in 1 M KCl. The ions used for probing the pore structure had the same relative mobilities while moving through the porin pore as they did while moving in free solution. Thus the single-channel conductances of the individual porins could be used to estimate the effective channel diameters of these porins, yielding values ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 nm. Zero-current potential measurements in the presence of salt gradients across lipid bilayer membranes containing individual porins gave results that were consistent with the conclusions drawn from the single-channel experiments. For all porins except protein P, the channels exhibited a greater cation selectivity for less mobile anions and a greater anion selectivity for less mobile cations, which again indicated that the ions were moving inside the pores in a fashion similar to their movement in the aqueous phase. Three porins, PhoE and NmpC of E. coli and protein P of P. aeruginosa, formed anion-selective pores. PhoE and NmpC were only weakly anion selective, and their selectivity was dependent on the mobility of the ions. In contrast, cations were unable to enter the selectivity filter of the protein P channel. This resulted in a high anion selectivity for all salts tested in this study. The other porins examined, including all of the known constitutive porins of the four gram-negative bacteria studied, were cation selective with a 3- to 40-fold preference for K+ ions over Cl- ions.
TI  - Protection against fatal Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis by immunization with smooth and rough lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - The protective capacity of various native and mutant lipopolysaccharide antigens  against fatal Pseudomonas aeruginosa burn wound sepsis was evaluated. Immunization with O-polysaccharide-deficient lipopolysaccharides derived from Escherichia coli J5 or Salmonella typhi Ty 21a afforded substantial protection against only one of five Pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge strains of various serotypes. Immunization with both lipopolysaccharide antigens evoked antibody of the immunoglobulin G class which recognized lipopolysaccharide isolated from the challenge strain against which protection was noted. This was not seen for the remaining four challenge strains. Attempts to demonstrate cross-serotype protection using O-antigen-deficient and core-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide antigens was, for the most part, unsuccessful. In contrast, high levels of protection against all six serotypes of challenge strains were seen following immunization with homologous lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - Binding of polymyxin B nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled PMBN. Smooth Salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of PMBN per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 X 10(6) to 2 X 10(6) molecules of PMBN per single cell. The binding was of relatively high affinity (Kd, 1.3 microM). The isolated outer membrane of S. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of PMBN per mg of outer membrane protein (Kd, 1.1 microM), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. Other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of PMBN (Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of PMBN. The S. typhimurium pmrA mutant, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Proteus mirabilis (all known as resistant to polymyxin and PMBN) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than S. typhimurium, respectively. The binding of PMBN to S. typhimurium was effectively inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin B, compound EM49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. Spermine, Ca2+, and Mg2+ also inhibited the PMBN binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin B, respectively. No binding inhibition was found at the tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.
TI  - Nonopsonic phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Salmonella typhimurium by peritoneal macrophages of mice immunized with slime-extract from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Treatment of mice with slime-extract (SE) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 219  failed to increase the proportion of ingested cells of Salmonella typhimurium by immune macrophages (M phi) of mice. However, activated with SE peritoneal SE peritoneal M phi displayed the enhancement of their nonspecific bactericidal activity. It has been found that immune M phi, depending on the dose of SE used for vaccination, killed intracellularly 38 to 67% of bacterial cells, whereas the mean value for the bactericidal capacity of normal resident phagocytes was 7%. The dose of 100 micrograms of SE enhanced activation of M phi to higher degree than 200 or 400 micrograms. The increase of microbicidal properties of M phi was also seen when mice were pretreated with 50 or 100 micrograms of SE and 24 h later were injected with live S. typhimurium cells. However, the amount of 200 or 400 micrograms significantly reduced the killing activity of M phi against these bacteria.
TI  - In vitro pyocin activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains pretreated with antibiotics.
AB  - Fifty-six selected strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa belonging to 8 different pyocin types (H, I, 15, 6, PTI-1, PTI-2, PTI-3, PTI-4) were treated with subinhibitory concentrations (MIC/2) of either gentamicin or carbenicillin. Both treatments induced changes in pyocin patterns for all types but at different levels. The percentage of strains that retained their pyocin pattern were more or less equal in both treatments. In treated and untreated producers, the growth inhibition ability for 5 different strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli K12, E. coli EB, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri) was also investigated. In all pyocin patterns the number of producers that inhibit the growth of these strains was lower after treatment with gentamicin or with carbenicillin, a smaller decrease was detected in the latter treatment. It appeared that the subinhibitory concentrations of these antibiotics are capable of protecting the Enterobacteriaceae strains from the action of the pyocins.
TI  - Transferable amikacin and cefamandole resistance: Pseudomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter strains as possible reservoirs of R plasmids.
AB  - Three strains belonging to gramnegative non-fermenting rods, i.e. a Pseudomonas maltophilia strain and two strains of Acinetobacter, were tested, as representatives of different types of nosocomial strains, for transferability of their multiple drug resistance. As all of them posed difficulties in demonstrating the transferability of their resistance by conventional methods, a three-step procedure was developed that includes a transfer to rifampicin-resistant P. aeruginosa recipients, then to susceptible P. aeruginosa intermediate strains, and, finally, from these strains to rifampicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. In three strains studied three genetically different types of R plasmids have been demonstrated. P. maltophilia transferred Amikacin resistance, as well as resistance to other antibiotics, to P. aeruginosa and then to Enterobacteria. In contrast, an Amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter with quite identical multiple drug resistance spectrum transferred its resistance to P. aeruginosa only, but not to Enterobacteria. Finally, another Acinetobacter strain, resistant to Gentamicin but susceptible to Amikacin transferred this resistance directly to Enterobacteria (and, separately, to P. aeruginosa, too). All three strains transferred Cefamandole resistance together with other resistances. Non-fermenting rods, thus, might be a source of transmissible resistance to reserve antibiotics as Amikacin, and advanced-type Cephalosporins.
TI  - Immunological study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracellular slime.
AB  - Crude extracellular slime (C-ES) was isolated from 15 laboratory strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Glycolypoprotein (GLP) was prepared from partially purified C-ES by the phenol treatment method. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were isolated from P. aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi-murium. Some correlation has been found between the quantity of the produced C-ES and virulence of P. aeruginosa for mice. Toxicity (LD50 value) and the yield of GLP did not correlate with the strain virulence. C-ES and GLP contained hexose, protein and hexosamine. Heptoses (characteristic LPS components) were present in C-ES and practically absent from GLP. Paper chromatographic analysis of GLP showed the presence of uronic acids, galactose, glucose and ribose in all strains; GLP of most strains contained rhamnose and a low amount of mannose and several strains xylose. Uronic acids, galactose and, probably, ribose and mannose were characteristic ES components. C-ES and GLP were studied in active and passive mouse protection. ES isolated from P. aeruginosa strains of different O serogroups or immunotypes induced a marked cross protective response.
TI  - Extension of bacteriophage lambda host range: selection, cloning, and characterization of a constitutive lambda receptor gene.
AB  - A set of plasmids has been constructed that carry a constitutive lamB gene (LamBc phenotype) from Escherichia coli and that confer functional phage lambda receptors to bacteria other than E. coli. This E. coli LamBc strain has been selected to escape both maltose-inducible and glucose-repressible control. Constitutivity results from an IS-3 insertion, carrying a mobile promoter, proximal to lamB. The LamBc DNA has been cloned into both broad and narrow host-range plasmids, and the resulting pTROY plasmids have been transferred to diverse bacteria. Both Salmonella typhimurium/pTROY and Klebsiella pneumoniae/pTROY strains efficiently adsorb phage lambda; Pseudomonas aeruginosa/pTROY strains do not. Introduction of a functional E. coli LamB protein into foreign bacterial will allow these bacteria carrying pTROY plasmids to be infected by phage lambda recombinant DNA libraries, phage lambda::Tn insertion mutagenesis vectors, and in vivo lambda-packaged cosmids.
TI  - Crossed immunoelectrophoretic analysis of anti-Salmonella typhi antibodies in sera of typhoid patients and carriers: demonstration of the presence of typhoid-specific antibodies to a non-O, non-H, non-Vi antigen.
AB  - A veronal buffer extract of Salmonella typhi was used as the reference antigen and its corresponding rabbit antiserum as the reference antibody in crossed immunoelectrophoresis to analyze antibodies in sera obtained from typhoid patients and carriers. Four precipitating antibodies were regularly detected. Three were against antigens common to other gram-negative bacteria and one appeared to be typhoid specific. Of the three common antigens, one (antigen no. 7) formed a precipitin resembling in mobility and morphology the lipopolysaccharide antigen seen in crossed immunoelectrophoresis analysis of other gram-negative bacteria. The other (antigen no. 19) was heat labile and antigenically similar to the reported common antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The third (antigen no. 14), also heat labile, was present in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae but not the family Pseudomonas. The typhoid-specific precipitating antibody present in sera of most typhoid patients and carriers but not patients infected with nontyphoid salmonella was directed to a heat-labile, non-O, non-H, and non-Vi antigen (antigen no. 28), probably protein in nature.
TI  - Effect of rat polymorphonuclear leukocyte granule components on the growth and survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Granule contents from rat polymorphonuclear neutrophils were prepared by extraction with 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH 4.0), dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0), and tested for bactericidal activity against selected target bacteria. Salmonella typhimurium LT-2 and a series of progressively rough lipopolysaccharide outer membrane mutants derived from it were used to monitor antimicrobial activity. Although an antimicrobial potential was present in rat granule contents for S. typhimurium, the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO-1 in antimicrobial assay mixtures containing rat granule contents was substantially enhanced over control values. The growth enhancement property of the granule protein was heat resistant and promoted increased oxygen consumption by whole cells.
TI  - Procedure for isolation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides from both smooth and rough Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium strains.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. It is now well established that within a single organism, size heterogeneity of this molecule can exist. We have developed a LPS isolation procedure which is effective in extracting both smooth and rough LPS in high yields (51 to 81% of the LPS present in whole cells as quantitated by using hydroxy fatty acid, heptose, and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate yields) and with a high degree of purity. The contamination by protein (0.1% by weight of LPS), nucleic acids (1%), lipids (2 to 5%), and other bacterial products was low. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the LPS demonstrated the presence of a high degree of size heterogeneity in the isolated smooth LPS as well as the presence of significant amounts of rough-type LPS. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS interacted well with a monoclonal antibody in a variety of immunochemical analyses. The usefulness of the procedure was demonstrated by comparing LPS preparations obtained from wild-type and mutant strains of P. aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. For example, it was shown that the LPS of an antibiotic supersusceptible mutant Z61 of P. aeruginosa, which was previously characterized as identical to wild type with respect to the ratio of smooth to rough LPS molecules isolated by the phenol-water procedure, actually contained only a small proportion of O-antigenic side chains.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of synthetic lipid A analogs and related compounds as compared with those of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, re-glycolipid, lipid A, and muramyl dipeptide.
AB  - Thirteen acylated and phosphorylated derivatives of beta-1,6-linked glucosamine disaccharide (lipid A analogs), which were synthesized after the structural model of Salmonella-type lipid A, and seven similar derivatives of glucosamine monosaccharide (lipid A-related compounds) were studied for their immunobiological activities. These included mitogenicity and polyclonal B cell activation enhancement of migration of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes derived from human peripheral blood, stimulation of guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, activation of human complement, and stimulation of serum antibody production and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity against ovalbumin in guinea pigs. Comparisons were made with lipid A, RE-glycolipid, lipopolysaccharide of natural sources, and a well-known synthetic adjuvant, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine. Some of the lipid A analogs were found to manifest the mitogenic, polyclonal B cell-activating macrophage-stimulating, complement-activating, and immunostimulating activities, although the observed activities were generally far less than those of natural products in intensity and efficiency. Other immunobiological effects exhibited by most of the synthetic lipid A analogs were the enhancement of migration of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It is premature to draw definite conclusions on structure-activity relationships, since a few compounds which were active in some assay systems were scarcely active in other assays. However, an indisputable fact was that beta-1,6-glucosamine disaccharide 1 alpha,4'-diphosphate, which carries two amide-bound (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl and three ester-bound tetradecanoyl residues, and thus has the structure most closely resembling natural lipid A among test compounds in this study, was definitely active in all of the present assay systems. However, its potency was generally much less than natural products. Some of glucosamine monosaccharide derivatives, especially N-(R)-3-[(R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyloxy]tetradecanoyl glucosamine, also exerted all of the in vitro activities described above. This fact suggests that a glucosamine disaccharide structure may not necessarily be a prerequisite as far as the in vitro immunobiological activities tested are concerned.
TI  - Sensitization of Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics and complement by a nontoxic oligopeptide.
AB  - A major virulence factor of bacteria that cause generalized infections is their resistance to the lytic action of the complement cascade, an important defence mechanism of the host. Invasive Gram-negative enteric bacteria, which cause about one-third of all bacteraemic infections, are completely resistant to lysis by complement, even in the presence of hyperimmune serum. The same bacteria are also resistant to many antibiotics that are effective therapeutic agents against other bacteria, as the outermost surface layer (the outer membrane) of the bacteria functions as a permeability barrier. Here we show that it is possible to sensitize such bacteria to both complement and antibiotics by using an agent that binds to the outer membrane. This agent is a nontoxic derivative of polymyxin which by itself has no bactericidal action.
TI  - [Biological effects of pyocins on Salmonella typhimurium strains inoculated into  the mouse].
AB  
TI  - Nonsense mutants of the lipid-containing bacteriophage PR4.
AB  - Thirty-three nonsense mutants of phage PR4 representing 12 complementation groups were isolated. One or two mutants of each group were grown on a suppressor-negative (Su-) host and characterized by the following criteria (i) proteins synthesized, (ii) level of phage DNA synthesis, and (iii) ability to assemble particles. We determined the protein and phospholipid compositions of the particles assembled in an Su- host, the presence of DNA in the particles, and the ability of the particles to adsorb to host cells. Finally each complementation group was tested for the ability to lyse an Su- host. We have identified one protein required for DNA synthesis, five proteins required for proper assembly of the protein coat and lipid membrane of the phage, two proteins required for stable insertion of DNA into the virion, a protein required for adsorption, a protein required for attachment of the adsorption protein to the virion, and a phage-encoded lytic enzyme.
TI  - Antibody response to the protein antigens of "Salmonella typhi" during typhoid infection and following vaccination with a live oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a.
AB  - Two protein antigens, named as S1Da and S1Db, common to many gram-negative bacteria, were prepared from an extract of Salmonella typhi cells. Antisera to S. typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, prepared by immunizing rabbits with acetone-treated cells of the corresponding bacterial species, all reacted against S1Da and S1Db as shown both by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Forty nine (98%) of the 50 tested sera obtained from typhoid patients while only 4 (8%) of the 50 sera obtained from febrile non-typhoid patients showed antibodies to S1Da and S1Db with ELISA titres above 1.000. S1Da and S1Db were then tested against 80 sera collected from 24 volunteers who had received a live typhoid vaccine Ty21a. Those vaccinees, who had antibodies to the LPS antigens of S. typhi following Ty21a vaccination, also developed antibodies to both the S1Da and S1Db antigens. Antigenically, S1Da and S1Db were different from each other and from the LPS antigens of S. typhi. S1Da and S1Db were basically protein in nature, the reactivity of these antigens against a positive control antiserum was destroyed by pronase, i.e., the addition of pronase after coating the MICROELISA plates with S1Da or S1Db reduced the ELISA titre to a minimum. Treatment with pronase, however, did not affect the ELISA titre when plates coated with the LPS antigens of S. typhi were used as the solid-phase antigen.
TI  - Delayed hypersensitivity in murine salmonellosis: specificity of footpad reaction in mice infected with rough mutants of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Delayed type (footpad) hypersensitivity (DTH) in BALB/c mice immunized with rough mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 was examined. Injection of live organisms of an Rb mutant TV148 strain induced DTH in mice, while injection of the heat-killed organisms did not. The mice immunized with live organisms of the Ra, Rb, Rc, Rd, and Re mutant strains showed positive footpad reactions to the heat-killed cell antigen of LT2 (wild type) strain. The mice immunized with the Rb mutant strain also showed positive footpad swellings in response to heat-killed cell antigens of S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, S. typhi, S. enteritidis, and S. cholerae-suis. Furthermore, positive reactions to antigens of Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri were seen in the TV148-immunized mice, but the mice did not respond to heat-killed organisms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. The cross-reactive footpad reaction to E. coli could be transferred adoptively with T cells prepared from the spleens of TV148-immunized mice into syngeneic recipients. These results suggest that the cross-reactive DTH antigen(s) is widely distributed among related organisms such as Shigella and Escherichia.
TI  - Proteins forming large channels from bacterial and mitochondrial outer membranes: porins and phage lambda receptor protein.
AB  
TI  - Enhanced phagocytic response of macrophages to bacteria by physical impact caused by bacterial motility or centrifugation.
AB  - The mechanism of enhanced phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of macrophages caused by bacterial motility (T. Tomita, E. Blumenstock, and S. Kanegasaki, Infect. Immun. 32:1242, 1981) was studied. Both responses increased up to a certain level with an increased number of motile bacteria, such as Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, added. In contrast, only a slight increase was observed with the motility (mot) mutants of these bacteria, even when 4,000 bacteria per single macrophage were added. If nonmotile bacteria were centrifuged together with a monolayer culture of macrophages, the number of bacteria ingested per macrophage increased dramatically. This phenomenon was not observed in the presence of cytochalasin B or at a low temperature, and about half of the associated bacteria were killed within 30 min of prolonged incubation, indicating that the bacteria were not simply embedded on the macrophage surface. An observed biphasic increase of ingestion with an increase in centrifugal force suggested the existence of a threshold velocity for efficient phagocytosis. The minimum centrifugal force required for maximal response was determined under the conditions in which equalized collision frequency between bacteria and macrophages was maintained when different centrifugal forces were employed. From the value obtained (5 x g), the required rate of movement was calculated as approximately 2.5 microns/s, supposing that the bacterium is spherical and has a 1-micron radius. This value is much lower than the velocity of movement of motile bacteria (20 to 50 microns/s). The results indicate that physical impact caused by bacterial motility is enough to induce a high response of macrophages.
TI  - Structure of the lipid-containing bacteriophage PRD1: disruption of wild-type and nonsense mutant phage particles with guanidine hydrochloride.
AB  - The lipid-containing bacteriophage PRD1 was disrupted, and the subviral particles were studied. Guanidine treatment released two phage proteins (P3 and P5). These proteins form the polyhedral capsid. The remaining phage proteins were associated with the phage membrane vesicle. The vesicle was capable of forming a tubular structure. The isolated phage membrane vesicles aggregated readily. We found that aggregation and tube formation were associated with specific phage proteins (P11 and P18, respectively) by using protease treatment and an analysis of nonsense mutant phage particles. In addition, the possibility that free vesicles might be precursors to empty virions was studied.
TI  - Assembly of bacteriophage PRD1: particle formation with wild-type and mutant viruses.
AB  - Bacteriophage PRD1 contains DNA, 17 proteins, and lipid. The assembly pathway involves the formation of empty particles that contain lipid and all of the proteins of mature virions, with the possible exception of one. The major and minor capsid proteins, P3 and P5, occur as soluble multimers before they appear in the empty particles. Nonsense mutants of PRD1 that involve structural proteins of the virion other than P3 form particles that are missing only the defective protein. Those mutants that are unable to form P3 do not form particles. Mutations in two other genes that code for nonstructural proteins (P10, which is membrane bound, and P17, which is soluble) result in the absence of particles. Protein P2 is necessary for adsorption to host cells. Protein P9 is necessary for particle filling with DNA, whereas P20 and P22 are necessary for stable DNA packaging. Electron micrographs of infected cells confirmed the gradient analysis of particle formation. No free vesicles were observed in mutants that could not form complete empty particles, indicating that there are no free intermediate particles before the empty virions.
TI  - The transfer RNA of certain Enterobacteriacae contain 2-methylthiozeatin riboside (ms2io6A) an isopentenyl adenosine derivative.
AB  - Isopentenyl adenosine derivatives are always located adjacent to the 3' end of the anticodon in transfer RNA and have been implicated in certain biological functions. In the enteric bacterium, E. coli, the derivative is ms2i6A whereas in some plant associated bacteria the derivative is the hydroxylated form, ms2io6A. Anti-i6A immunoadsorbent chromatography has been employed to detect isopentenyl adenosine compounds. In the present study we show that the transfer RNA of three species of enteric bacteria, S. typhimurium, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens contains both ms2io6A and ms2i6A. Under the growth conditions utilized the ms2io6A is predominant. The presence of ms2io6A in Enterobacteriacae is particularly noteworthy since in previous work it has been found only in plant-associated species of bacteria.
TI  - Common evolutionary origin of chromosomal beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteria.
AB  - A 32P-labeled fragment of DNA, encoding the major part of the chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase gene of Escherichia coli K-12, was used as a hybridization probe for homologous DNA sequences in colonies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and different enterobacterial species. The ampC probe detected the presence of homologous DNA sequences in clinical isolates of E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. No hybridization was found with N. gonorrhoeae colonies. In Southern blotting experiments the ampC probe hybridized to chromosomal DNA fragments of the same size in all enterobacterial species tested. However, the degree of hybridization differed with DNA from different species. DNA from the Shigella species strongly hybridized to the ampC probe. Furthermore, antibodies raised against purified E. coli K-12 ampC beta-lactamase precipitated beta-lactamases from the Shigella species, suggesting extensive sequence similarities between the ampC genes of these genera. The production of chromosomal beta-lactamase in S. sonnei increased with increasing growth rate similar to E. coli K-12. This growth rate response was abolished in two beta-lactamase-hyperproducing S. sonnei mutants, which thus seem similar to E. coli K-12 attenuator mutants. We propose that both the structure and regulation of the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes are very similar in E. coli and in S. sonnei.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity, in vitro and in vivo, of soft N-chloramine systems and chlorhexidine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of the following four new N-chloramine compounds was evaluated: two chlorinated simple amino acids, a chlorinated half-ester of succinic acid, and a chlorinated half-ester of glutaric acid. For comparison, the known bactericidal agents 3-chloro-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolidinone and chlorhexidine were evaluated by the same procedure. The contact germicidal efficiency screen was used to examine the in vitro bactericidal activity of all six compounds in the absence and presence of 5% horse serum or 5% Triton X-100. The four new compounds were found to have greater germicidal activity than the other compounds tested and to exhibit low toxicity and skin irritation values. The in vivo bactericidal activity was evaluated in two studies. In the occlusion test, three of the four new compounds plus chlorhexidine diacetate were tested. The N-chloramines were significantly superior to chlorhexidine in preventing the expansion of the normal flora under occlusion. In the scrub test, a gloved-hand wash method was used to compare the antimicrobial effect of a 1% solution of the chlorinated half-ester of succinic acid in triacetin with that of a commercial germicidal hand wash containing 4% chlorhexidine gluconate. The two preparations exhibited essentially the same hand-degerming activity.
TI  - Essential regions of the lipopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for pyrogenicity and activation of the proclotting enzyme of horseshoe crabs. Comparison with antitumor, interferon-inducing and adjuvant activities.
AB  - Regions of lipopolysaccharide derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa essential for pyrogenicity and activation of the proclotting enzyme of the horseshoe crab were examined. Free lipid A with intact fatty acids showed strong pyrogenicity but showed little activation of the proclotting enzyme. Chemical modification of the polysaccharide portion and deacylation of the lipopolysaccharide diminished activation of the proclotting enzyme. The native-protein portion attached to the lipopolysaccharide also inhibited the activation of proclotting enzyme by lipopolysaccharide, but not pyrogenicity. These results indicate that free lipid A is sufficient for pyrogenicity, whereas the complete lipopolysaccharide is the strongest activator of the proclotting enzyme. The lipopolysaccharide of P. aeruginosa, which showed the strongest activation of proclotting enzyme, showed the weakest pyrogenicity of all the lipopolysaccharides tested here. All these results demonstrate that there is not correlation between pyrogenicity and proclotting enzyme activation induced by lipopolysaccharides.
TI  - Fractionation and characterization of the phosphoenolpyruvate: fructose 1-phosphotransferase system from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The initial reactions involved in the catabolism of fructose in Pseudomonas aeruginosa include the participation of a phosphoenolpyruvate:fructose 1-phosphotransferase system (F-PTS). Fractionation of crude extracts of fructose-grown cells revealed that both membrane-associated and soluble components were essential for F-PTS activity. Further resolution of the soluble fraction by both size exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography revealed the presence of only one component, functionally analogous to enzyme I. Enzyme I exhibited a relative molecular weight of 72,000, catalyzed the pyruvate-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and mediated the phosphorylation of fructose when combined with a source of enzyme II (washed membranes). No evidence for the requirement of a phosphate carrier protein, such as HPr, could be demonstrated. Thus, the F-PTS requires a minimum of two components, a soluble enzyme I and a membrane-associated enzyme II complex, and both were shown to be inducible. Reconstituted F-PTS activity was specific for phosphoenolpyruvate as a phosphate donor (Km, approximately -0.6 mM) and fructose as the sugar substrate (Km, approximately 18 microM). Components of the Pseudomonas F-PTS did not restore activity to extracts of deletion mutants of Salmonella typhimurium deficient in individual proteins of the PTS or to fractionated membrane and soluble components of the F-PTS of Escherichia coli. Similarly, membrane and soluble components of E. coli and S. typhimurium would not cross-complement the F-PTS components from P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Hexachlorophene. Secondary microorganism resistance to hexachlorophene. Conjugative transfer inhibition by the R-plasmid-coded resistance by hexachlorophene.
AB  - Strain resistance of the genus Escherichia, Salmonella, and Pseudomonas to hexachlorophene is inducible. Secondary resistance of the Gram-negative microorganisms to hexachlorophene is an inherited property of these strains. There are not any explicit differences of primary sensitivity to hexachlorophene between sensitive strains and those resistant to antibiotics. The secondary resistance level of Gram-negative microorganisms to hexachlorophene is also not dependent on the natural resistance (or sensitivity) of strains to antibiotics. Hexachlorophene, in concentration of 10 micrograms/ml of conjugation mixture, causes 100% inhibition of the conjugation transfer of the resistance determinants to antibiotics from tested strains with conjugative R-plasmid. The indirect secondary resistance conjugation transfer to hexachlorophene was verified in two cases. The resistance to hexachlorophene was transferred, coupled with resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin, from the Escherichia coli strains (No. 8) and Salmonella typhimurium (No. 4) to the recipient Escherichia coli strain K 12, SZK-Ec-329/74 (No. 2).
TI  - Phage X: a plasmid-dependent, broad host range, filamentous bacterial virus.
AB  - Phage X was isolated from sewage as plating on Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium strains harbouring the incompatibility group X plasmid R6K. It also plated on a strain of Serratia marcescens carrying this plasmid. It failed to form plaques on Proteus mirabilis, P. morganii or Providencia alcalifaciens harbouring R6K, but did multiply on them. No phage increase occurred with homologous R- strains. Phage X also plated or registered an increase in titre on E. coli or S. typhimurium strains carrying various plasmids of incompatibility groups M, N, P-1, U or W as well as the unassigned plasmid R775. It adsorbed to pili determined by a group P-10 plasmid in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain but did not multiply on this organism. The phage was filamentous and curly, resistant to ribonuclease and diethyl ether and sensitive to chloroform. It adsorbed to the tips of pili.
TI  - Changes in the activity of antifungals in mixed cultures of bacteria and yeasts.
AB  - When Candida cells were grown in mixed cultures with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their sensitivity to antifungal agents affecting sterol metabolism or functioning (polyenes and miconazole) was increased by several log units. This phenomenon was overcome by the addition to the culture medium of sugars utilized either by the bacteria or the yeast. Antifungals without direct effect on sterol metabolism (5-fluorocytosine, methylparaben, and 4-hydroxyquinazoline) were not more active in mixed than in pure cultures.
TI  - Iron-related modification of bacterial transfer RNA.
AB  - Transfer RNAs isolated from E. coli grown in media where ferric iron is not freely available show well characterized chromatographic changes due to the absence of the methylthio moiety of ms2i6A. The altered tRNA molecules include tRNA trp tRNA tyr, tRNA phe and two minor tRNA ser species. It has been suggested that methylthiolation of tRNA affects its function in regulation. We now show iron-related changes in tRNA trp from S. typhimurium, Ps. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. tRNA trp from S. typhimurium contains ms2i6A and it seems probable that the availability of iron affects the synthesis of ms2i6A-tRNA trp from i6A-tRNA trp in this organism. An iron-related methylthiolating system may also be operative in K. pneumoniae. S. marcescens tRNA trp, however was not affected by the availability of iron. Neither ms2i6A nor i6A was found in S. marcescens tRNA, although an, as yet unidentified, hydrophobic nucleoside was present.
TI  - Phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed Salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  - In the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living Salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. This phenomenon was observed whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. The different response to living and killed bacteria was also found with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, but not with Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Propionibacterium acnes. The results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. The experimental results obtained with motility mutants of S. typhimurium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative study of the mutagenic activity of organophosphate insecticides on bacteria].
AB  - Mutagenic activity of the organo-phosphorus insecticides, metaphos, phosphamide and carbophos, on indicator Salmonella typhimurium TA-1535 strain is shown which is determined without metabolic activation. It is established that all the three preparations induce direct mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The quantity of visible mutations increases with the prolongation of exposure time and the insecticide concentration. Metaphos and phosphamide induced auxotrophic mutations. Phosphamide has the highest mutagenic activity in the assays with bacterial systems.
TI  - Expression of E. coli genes carried by hybrids of plasmid RP4.
AB  - Hybrids of the RP4 plasmid, containing bacteriophage Mu and chromosomal genes of  Escherichia coli, were transferred into Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The individual genes of the arginine, histidine, leucine and threonine operons were expressed in these microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of Salmonella typhi. Piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. The relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. In addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. This investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. S. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. Inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) CFU, and inocula of 10(2) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) CFU. Piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. Combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against Pseudomonas and Serratia isolates. Less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against Klebsiella and indole-positive Proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. Occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a general hospital. Clinical implications.
AB  - This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.

TI  - Treatment failures secondary to in vivo development of drug resistance by microorganisms.
AB  - In two patients development of resistance to antibiotics by initially sensitive infecting organisms was associated with relapse or persistence of active infection. The first patient developed Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to chloramphenicol during therapy with this agent for an infection that followed a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, and the second patient developed bacteremia due to ampicillin-resistant Salmonella during therapy with ampicillin. Treatment failure resulting from in vivo development of resistance to antimicrobial agents has been described for most of the major classes of antiinfective drugs and for numerous microorganisms. Although in many of these instances reinfection with a resistant organism cannot be excluded, there are many examples of apparent mutation or initial infection with both sensitive and resistant bacterial populations that is followed by selective multiplication of the resistant population or acquisition of resistance by an initially sensitive infecting organism. This phenomenon can be a cause of treatment failure and has appeared in patients in whom, by available tests, drug levels were found adequate. Isolation days after the institution of antimicrobial therapy of what appears to be the same organism as was initially recovered should prompt repeated sensitivity tests, at least to the agents being administered, if the patient's clinical course has not been one of satisfactory improvement.
TI  - A comparative study of the lethal effect of metabisulphite on the viability of three bacterial species in bone meal and gelatin.
AB  - An investigation into the effect of sodium metabisulphite on the viability of three bacterial species, Salmonella typhimurium 59143, Escherichia coli ES-1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8602, in bone meal and gelatin has been reported in this paper. Methods used in detecting the viability of the bacteria after exposure to metabisulphite-treated bone meal and gelatin have been presented. Results have shown that the bacterial species were all susceptible to metabisulphite in both rendered by-products but in all cases, the micro-organisms were far more susceptible in metabisulphite-treated gelatin than in metabisulphite-treated bone meal. Reasons for the difference in susceptibility were also adduced.
TI  - Comparative studies on the regulation of tryptophan synthesis.
AB  - In vitro DNA recombination techniques have revolutionized the study of genetic control of biosynthetic pathways. Using examples drawn from the pathway of tryptophan synthesis, approaches to the deciphering of regulatory signals and response mechanisms through transposition of DNA segments and DNA sequence analysis will be presented. After reviewing the known chromosomal arrangements and regulatory patterns of trp genes in the bacterial groups studied so far, and describing the results of transferring all or part of the pathway's genes from one organism to a distantly related one, the use of this technique to analyze new organisms will be described. Along with some advantages over the conventional methods there are some pitfalls. Finally, since it is likely that events analogous to recombinant DNA experiments take place readily in nature, their consequences in studies of bacterial evolution will be conjectured.
TI  - Enhancement of endotoxic shock by N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-(L-seryl)-D-isoglutamine (muramyl dipeptide).
AB  - We described elsewhere that the synergistic antitumor activity of endotoxic extracts from Re mutants of gram-negative bacteria and trehalose mycolate against guinea pig syngeneic line 10 tumor was abrogated after peptide substances accompanying these extracts had been removed. This activity could be restored by combining peptide-free endotoxin either with cell wall skeleton from Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, a polymeric mycolic acid-arabinogalactan-mucopeptide complex, or with a combination of two separate components, trehalose dimycolate and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-(L-seryl)-D-isoglutamine (MDP). We report here that when a combination of endotoxin (150 microgram) and a mixture of MDP (150 microgram) and trehalose dimycolate (150 microgram) was inoculated into established dermal tumors, a significant number of the animals died, presumably of endotoxic shock. All surviving animals suffered severe but temporary lethargy. When administered alone intradermally in the dose levels tested, none of the components caused severe lethargy or lethality. The lethal effects of 159 microgram of MDP also occurred in combination with relatively weak endotoxic products, such as Pseudomonas vaccine (Pseudogen), and these effects did not depend upon the presence of malignant tissue. Guinea pigs inoculated i.v. were even more susceptible inasmuch as the addition of as little as 6 microgram of MDP to 150 microgram of Pseudogen, itself not lethal, caused the death of 80% of the animals.
TI  - Biological effects of magnetic fields: studies with microorganisms.
AB  - Five bacteria and one yeast were grown in magnetic fields of 50-900 gauss with frequencies of 0-0.3 HZ and square, triangular, or sine waveform. Growth of these microorganisms could be stimulated or inhibited depending upon the field strength and frequency of the pulsed magnetic field. Spore germination and mutation frequency were unaffected by the magnetic fields used in this study.

TI  - The effects of the ultraviolet-protecting plasmids pKM101 and R205 on DNA polymerase I activity in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - The mutagenesis- and repair-enhancing plasmids pKM101 and R205 were introduced into a series of Esherichia coli K-12 polA mutants including two temperature-sensitive mutants. Polymerase levels in extracts of these strains were assayed using an activated DNA template. In none of the cases did the presence of the plasmid in the strains change either the initial rate of incorporation of [3H]thymidine triphosphate into acid-soluble material or the subsequent degradation of the template at longer reaction times. Neither did the presence of the plasmids affect the proportion of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive polymerase activity detected. Previous studies have reported increased polymerase I-like activity of polA mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa upon introduction of mutagenesis- and repair-enhancing plasmids. Our experiments indicate that, at least, such an increase in polymerase-I-like activity is not an obligatory phenotype associated with these plasmids.
TI  - Conversion of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol to a mutagen by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) to  2-amino-4,6-dinitrophenol (picramic acid) under anaerobic conditions. Mutagenic assays of picric acid and picramic acid were carried out with histidine-requiring strains of Salmonella typhimurium. Picric acid (10 micrograms per plate) demonstrated mutagenicity (both frame shift and base substitution-gype mutations) only after activation with a rat liver homogenate preparation. Picramic acid (1 microgram per plate) induced both base pair substitution and frame shift-tupe mutations without activation by the rat liver preparation.
TI  - Thermosensitive H1 plasmids determining citrate utilization.
AB  - Twelve thermosensitive H1 plasmids from strains of Salmonella typhi that had caused outbreaks of chloramphenicol-resistant typhoid fever in Vietnam, Thailand and India mediated citrate utilization (Cit+) in a prototrophic Escherichia coli K12 strain but not in the S. typhi strains from which they were derived. Four H1 plasmids from a similar outbreak in Mexico differed from the Far Eastern plasmids in not mediating citrate utlization but in mediating mercury resistance. H1 plasmids resembling the Far Eastern and the Mexican plasmids in regard to citrate utilization and mercury resistance were found in sewage in Britain. Citrate utilization was transferred to eight pathogenic strains of E. coli and to one strain each of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei. Cultures of Cit+ bacteria grew more rapidly in citrate media at 28 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Plasmid mutants that were more efficient at utilizing citrate were present in all such cultures--they grew equally well or better at 37 degrees C than at 28 degrees C. None of 222 strains of E. coli or Shigella that contained a variety of different plasmids were able to utilize citrate. This property was not transferred to the prototrophic E. coli K12 strain from Citrobacter (3 strains), Salmonella (39 strains), Proteus (44 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (33 strains) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (44 strains).
TI  - Binding of cholesterol by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The binding of [1,2-3H]cholesterol to Neisseria gonorrhoeae CS-7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium (smooth and rough strains) was investigated. The kinetics of cholesterol binding to N. gonorrhoeae CS-7 demonstrated that binding occurred slowly with maximum binding by 10 h. Under optimum conditions, a large percentage (65%) of the added cholesterol was associated with the cells. Chemical fractionation revealed that ca. 98% of the labeled cholesterol was associated with the cell membrane(s). The bound cholesterol was not esterified and was associated primarily with the cytoplasmic membrane. Intact gonococci bound 4 to 30 times more cholesterol than the deep rough mutant S. typhimurium TA1535, the wild-type S. typhimurium DB-21, and P. aeruginosa. In contrast, isolated cell membranes from all organisms rapidly bound cholesterol to the same extent. Therefore, the outer membrane can function as a permeability barrier to cholesterol. Cholesterol binding to both whole cells and isolated cell membranes was influenced by the incubation temperature. The rate of cholesterol binding by whole cells of N. gonorrhoeae decreased markedly at lower temperatures, with almost complete cessation of binding at 0 degrees C. A similar temperature effect on the binding of cholesterol to isolated membranes was not observed. Thus, the effect of temperature on the binding of cholesterol to whole cells was an effect not on the actual binding process but rather on the ability of the cholesterol molecule to penetrate the lipid domain of the gonococcal outer membrane.
TI  - Dry-heat destruction of lipopolysaccharide: dry-heat destruction kinetics.
AB  - Dry-heat destruction kinetics of lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Salmonella typhosa at 170 to 250 degrees C are described. The destruction rate seems to follow the second order and can be linearized by the equation, log y = a + b . -10cx. Because c is the slope, 1/c = D3. Both a and b are constant at a given temperature and are linear functions of temperature. The D(3)170, D(3)190, D(3)210, D(3)230, and D(3)250 values for E. coli lipopolysaccharide are 251, 99.4, 33.3, 12.3, and 4.99 min, respectively, with a z value of 46.4 min. The D values for lipopolysaccharides from S. marcescens and S. typhosa are not significantly different from those from E. coli lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - Isolation of large bacterial plasmids and characterization of the P2 incompatibility group plasmids pMG1 and pMG5.
AB  - Large plasmids from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were routinely and consistently isolated using a procedure which does not require ultracentrifugation but includes steps designed to separate large-plasmid DNA from the bacterial folded chromosome. It also selectively removes fragments of broken chromosome. A variety of large plasmids was readily visualized with agarose gel electorphoresis, including five between 70 and 85 megadaltons (Mdal) in size, six between 90 and 143 Mdal, one that was larger than 200 Mdal, and one that was larger than 300 Mdal. This isolation procedure allowed initial estimation of the molecular sizes of the two IncP2 plasmids, pMG1 and pMG5, which were 312 and 280 Mdal, respectively. A standard curve for size determination by gel electrophoresis including plasmids between 23 and 143 Mdal in size did not extrapolate linearly for plasmids of the 300-Mdal size range. Unique response of different plasmids to the isolation procedure included sensitivity of IncP1 plasmids to high pH and the co-isolation of a 20-Mdal "cryptic" plasmid in conjunction.
TI  - Heterologous transfection with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA: and improved system.
AB  - A highly efficient and much more reproducible system for the heterologous transfection of several kinds of Gram-negative bacterial spheroplasts with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA was established. By mild washing of the speroplasts, the efficiency of transfection of all non-host heterologous bacterial species tested increased one or more orders of magnitude in producing the progeny phages and/or the infectious intermediates. Using the improved heterologous transfection systems, it has become clearer that a strong suppression system operates on the processes of phiX174 progeny phage production and not on those of phiX174 dougle-stranded replicative form DNA synthesis in the heterologous bacterial cells. Similar stimulatory effects of this washing procedure were observed in the homologous transfection. With this improved assay system, even less than 100 molecules of phage phiX174 DNA can be detected and the number of molecules can be determined with accuracy.
TI  - [Aggravation of experimental dysentery in mice and acceleration of the process of multiplication of pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic bacteria under the effect of yeast RNA].
AB  - Simultaneous infection of mice with Sh. flexneri subtype 2a, culture, with various doses of RNA sodium salt (NaRNA) or administration of the preparation 3 hours prior to or 6, 12, and 18 hours after the infection was accompanied by aggravation of the experimental infection in mice. This was expressed in a greater number of animals which contracted the disease and died, and in increased blood and peritoneal exudate microbiol density. The same processes were noted in mice infected with equal doses of shigella cultures passaged four times through broth with NaRNA, in comparison with the animals infected with shigellae passaged through broth alone. Incubation of a number of pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microbes in broth with NaRNA was accompanied by a significant increase in the bacterial biomass volume; at the same time other conditionally patoogenic microbes or even different strains of the same type of the microbes reacted to NaRNA but weakly. A possibility of realization of all of these processes in vivo and their influence on the origination of bacterial complications and development of the infection is supposed.
TI  - Induction of bacteriolytic enzyme from pyocinogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its enzymatic properties.
AB  - Mitomycin C induced a pyocinogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa P15 to produce a bacteriolytic enzyme, PR1-lysozyme, together with pyocin R1. No significant accumulation of the enzyme was observed inside the induced cells. The enzyme was partially purified by acrinol treatment and Amberlie CG-50 column chromatography. The mode of action of the enzyme on the host bacterial cells as well as on Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells or peptidoglycan isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, was compared with that of hen egg-white lysozyme or phage lambda-lysozyme. It is suggested that PR1-lysozyme should be classified as a glycosidase, rather than an amidase or an endopeptidase.
TI  - Aminopeptidase I activities in several microorganisms.
AB  - Aminopeptidase I activity which was found to be localized in the same subcellular fraction and to be similarly heat stable was partially purified by a common procedure from Escherichia coli B, Escherichia coli K12, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris. The enzyme preparations were shown to contain a single animopeptidase active toward both leucylleucine and methionylalanylserine by mixed-substrate initial-velocity kinetic analysis. The Km value for leucylleucine was virtually identical for the aminopeptidases of all of the organisms, as was the Km value for methionylalanylserine.

AB  - The binding of [1,2-(3)H]progesterone to progesterone-sensitive Neisseria gonorrhoeae CS-7 and the progesterone-insensitive Neisseria mucosa, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium (rough and smooth strains) was investigated. The kinetics of binding to N. gonorrhoeae CS-7 demonstrated that the majority of the progesterone binding occurred and equilibrium was reached within the first 30 min. Despite the rapid binding of progesterone, only about 20% of the added steroid was bound at the cell concentration used throughout this study. Whole cells of progesterone-insensitive bacteria bound progesterone less efficiently than the progesterone-sensitive N. gonorrhoeae CS-7. N. mucosa bound low amounts of this steroid (20% of that bound by N. gonorrhoeae CS-7) whereas the other gram-negative bacteria exhibited little progesterone binding (<3% of that bound by N. gonorrhoeae CS-7). The outer membrane permeability of N. gonorrhoeae CS-7, as measured by crystal violet uptake and inhibition, was similar to the deep rough mutant of S. typhimurium TA 1535. The latter organism neither bound nor was inhibited by progesterone. However, isolated cell envelopes of N. gonorrhoeae and progesterone-insensitive bacteria all bound progesterone equally well. Cortisone and cholesterol, althouh structurally similar to progesterone, were not inhibitory to N. gonorrhoeae and did not bind to whole cells as well as progesterone. The major site of progesterone binding appeared to be the cytoplasmic membrane, which bound four times more progesterone than the outer membrane. In addition, isolated cytoplasmic membrane proteins bound more than three times more progesterone per milligram of protein than the intact membrane.

AB  - Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli strains bearing transferable resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, namely, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, lividomycin, and carbenicillin, as well as to a series of more classical drugs, began to emerge in materials from the Frankfurt University Hospital. Plasmids from Serratia, Klebsiella, and E. coli exhibit a broad host range in that they are transferable to E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium receipients. They are not transferable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although in that species plasmids of gentamicin and tobramycin resistance, was well as of resistance to further drugs, were detected in that area as early as in 1973. High-level carbenicillinase has been identified in Serratia and Klebsiella plasmids associated with drug resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.

AB  - Sensitivity to antibacterial agents may be studied using quantitative dilution tests and qualitative diffusion tests. There is a strongly felt need for standardized testing methods. Currently, the so-called Bauer-Kirby method appears to be the most suitable test, also for use in veterinary medicine. When this technique is adopted, results are classifid as "sensitive", "resistant" and "showing diminished sensitivity". Interpretations are based on pharmacological, bacteriological and clinical criteria. In some situations, in vitro results have not been sufficiently tested in the field. This would appear to be particularly so in local conditions and treatment.
TI  - Basic characterization of W-pili.
AB  - The bacterial drug-resistance plasmids Sa, R388 and R7K that comprise the W compatability group were transferred by conjugation to species in the genera Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas, chosen for their lack of common pili. On receiving the W plasmids, all strains produced pili, which were similar morphologically, at average frequencies of up to 3-0 pila/cell. The pili determined by the W plasmids were also related serologically, but unrelated to those of other plasmids. R- segregant strains which had lost their plasmids showed a simultaneous loss of both pili and drug-resistance characteristics. W-pili are pointed flexible filaments 10 to 12 nm thick, with an average length of 450 nm. The best host found was Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - Comparative effect of methioninyl adenylate on the growth of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The bacteriostatic effect of methioninyl adenylate(MAMP)--a specific inhibitor of the enzyme methionyl-tRNA synthetase--was investigated on Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 0.1 mM of this molecule added to the culture, inhibits the growth of S. typhimurium. The inhibition is specifically reversible by 0.1 mM L-methionine. In the same conditions even 1-2 mM MAMP has a very slight effect on the growth rate of P. aeruginosa and only during the first two generations. The same observation was made with the two other members of the fluorescens group P.fluorescens and P.putida. The growth rate of P. testosteroni with 1 mM MAMP in the medium is similar to the growth rate of P. aeruginosa but the other member of the acidovorans group P. acidovorans is much more affected by the smae concentration of the inhibitor. --P. multivorans is inhibited by MAMP like P. acidovorans but with a somewhat higher yield at the end of the culture. --MAMP has no effect on P. alcaligenes. The possible reasons for the weak bacteriostatic effect of MAMP on P. aeruginosa were investigated. It was established that the inhibitor enters the cells and is not used as a carbon and energy source. The intracellular methionine concentration in S. typhimurium and in P. aeruginosa is about the same and does not increase when bacteria are cultivated with MAMP. The MTS of the two microorganisms is inhibited by MAMP in vitro to about the same extent. Furthermore the tRNAmet from P. aeruginosa are fully acylated after 3 to 4 generations with this compound. Nevertheless MAMP elicits higher MTS activity in P. aeruginosa and in P. acidovorans after 1 h of incubation. The most striking difference between S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa is that the intra and extracellular level of 5'phosphodiesterase which degrades MAMP is 10-20 fold higher in the second than in the first species.
TI  - Outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. XII. Molecular-sieving function of cell wall.
AB  - The permeability function the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria such as Salmoenlla was investigated by producing cells with an expanded periplasmic volume, and incubating them with radioactive non-utilizable oligo- and polysaccharides or polyethylene glycols. To quantitative the extent of penetration of these hydrophilic compounds into the periplasm, the radioactivity of the cell pellet was determined after centrifugation. We found that only di- and trisaccharides could fully diffuse into the periplasm, whereas higher-molecular-weight saccharides were nonpenetrable. In addition, low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycols rapidly diffused across the cell wall. Kinetics experiments also showed that both sucrose and raffinose in the periplasm exchanged rapidly with sugars in the medium, even at 0 degrees C. These results suggest that the cell wall acts as a molecular sieve, with an exclusion limit near 550 to 650 daltons for saccharides. We also suggest that the diffusion of these hydrophilic compounds most likely occurs through water-filled pores present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Examination of bacterial flagellation by dark-field microscopy.
AB  - A method is described for visualizing unstained bacterial flagella by dark-field  light microscopy. Since individual filaments can be seen, a genus such as Salmonella, which is peritrichously flagellated, can readily be distinguished from a polarly flagellated genus such as Pseudomonas. Polarly flagellated bacteria generally swim much faster than peritrichously flagellated bacteria, and turn by abrupt reversals. The differences in flagellation and motility provide diagnostic criteria that may be useful in clinical microbiology.
TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - Nonspecific bactericidal activity of the lactoperoxidases-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system of milk against Escherichia coli and some gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Two strains of Escherichia coli and one strain each of Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed by the bactericidal activity of the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system in milk and in a synthetic medium. H2O2 was supplied exogenously by glucose oxidase, and glucose was produced at a level which was itself noninhibitory. Two phases were distinguished: the first phase was dependent on the oxidation of SCN(-) by lactoperoxidase and H2O2, which was reversed by reducing agent, and the second phase was dependent on the presence of accumulated H2O2, which was reversed by catalase. The latter enzyme could also reverse the first phase, but only when present in excessive and unphysiological levels. The bactericidal activity was greatest at pH 5 and below, and it depended on the SCN(-)concentration and on the number of organisms. Since raw or heated milk neutralizes the acid barrier against infection in the stomach, the bactericidal system discussed may contribute to the prevention of enteric infections in neonates.
TI  - Beta-lactam antibiotics with N-oxide side chains. 1. Quinoxaline N-oxides.
AB  - A series of penicillin derivatives of quinoxaline di-N-oxide carboxylic acids was prepared. These compounds were prepared from the acid chlorides and mixed anhydrides of the quinoxaline di-N-oxides. The compounds prepared exhibited minimal antibacterial activity against gram-negative organisms.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of antibiotics in human bile (author's transl)].
AB  - Marked differences exist between antibacterial activity in human bile and broth.  Whereas penicillins and cephalosporines exhibit virtually the same activity in broth and bile, tetracycline shows a great lose, and the activity of the aminoglykosides is increased in bile. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of chlorampenicol and co-trimoxazole are also different in broth and human bile. The differences in activity are related to the pH although not all deviations can be attributed to the effect of the pH. These results should be considered when treating gallbladder infections.
TI  - The effect of cooling and warming rates on the survival of a variety of bacteria.
AB  - Cooling and warming rates affect bacterial survival profoundly with all bacteria  tested (Azotobacter chroococcum, Klebsiella aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis) behaving similarly. Most bacteria were sensitive to salt on freezing and thawing. Viabilities of population frozen and thawed in saline were always less (by at least 20%) than comparable ones frozen in water alone. Under these conditions, S. faecalis was resistant to the presence of sodium chloride; viabilities of populations frozen in the presence or absence of sodium chloride were always less than 5% different. The implications of these results in light of the organisms' shape, Gram stain, and respiration are discussed.
TI  - Phospholipase D activity of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A phospholipase hydrolyzing cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in preparations of gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver mitochondria. In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.
TI  - Effect of glucocorticosteroids on the phagocytosis and intracellular killing by peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - The effect of hydrocortisone on the phagocytosis and intracellular killing by mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro was studied by a method making it possible to measure these processes separately. The results showed that in vivo treatment with 15 mg of hydrocortisone acetate did not significantly decrease the phagocytosis of several bacterial species such as Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The killing indexes of normal macrophages for the various microorganisms were found to be significantly different. This may indicate that the bactericidal mechanisms are not uniform for these bacteria. The effect of hydrocortisone on the intracellular killing was also variable. For Staphylococcus albus a normal killing index was found. For the other species of bacterial and for Candida albicans some decrease was found, but this was only significant for Salmonella typhimurium. It is concluded that a decrease host resistance due to glucocorticosterioid treatment is not caused by a direct effect of these drugs on the phagocytosis and intracellular killing by mononuclear phagocytes.

TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Effect of erythrocytes treated with enterobacterial common antigen on experimental Salmonella typhimurium infection of mice.
AB  - The immunogenicity of enterobacterial common antigen (CA)-treated horse or mouse  erythrocytes was determined in Swiss white albino mice by comparing survival rates with control mice, immunized with P. aeruginosa fraction-treated RBC and challenged in parallel with 10 LD50 S. typhimurium. The administration of small amounts of CA on horse, but not mouse, RBC significantly delayed mortality; protection was only marginally less than that evoked with 12-fold larger amounts of CA in the absence of RBC. Survival in infected animals was transient; independent of immunogen or control preparation employed, all mice were dead by day 15 after challenge.
TI  - A theoretical approach of disinfectant testing.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to compare six methods of disinfectant testing, currently applied in Europe. The testing techniques are analysed into the separate elements, which can influence the activity of the disinfectant. The differences observed in these components allow to explain why in each method other parameters are evaluated and consequently, why the interpretation of the results varies from method to method. The six tests examined are (1) the suspension test of the DGHM, (2) the suspension test of the Committee on Phytopharmacy, (3) the A.O.A.C. use-dilution method, (4) the KELSEY SYKES test, (5) the surface-disinfection test of the DGHM and (6) a modified version of this latter. First of all the final concentrations of the disinfectant in the medication mixture are calculated. On the KELSEY SYKES test differs from the others, in using a much lower final dilution, up to 50% in the 3 rd stage. It is also obvious that the longer the exposure time is, the greater the killing effect on the bacteria in the medication mixture will be. To determine the germicidal activity a method needs to pass the test, the germicidal effect has been assessed starting from the inoculum applied in the medication mixture and, in case of tests that consider the absence of growth in the subcultures as end-point, the minimum extinction required. The lowest number of bacteria is applied in the inoculum of the A.O.A.C. use-dilution method (ca. 10(6)) and the highest in the modified practical surface disinfection test (ca. 10(10)). So the required germicidal effect varies from 5 (in case of the Committee on Phytopharmacy's test and the modified practical test) to more than 8 (in case of the A.O.A.C. use-dilution method). Further on, the protein content of the bacterial suspension which is added to the medication mixture, is experimentically verified. Considerable differences are observed here. In some tests the presence of organic matter is negligible (the A.O.A.C. use-dilution method, the KELSEY SYKES test under clean conditions), whereas in others (the KELSEY SYKES test under dirty conditions and the practical surface disinfection tests) the protein added equals that of serum 10-30%. Finally it is mentioned that the dilutions in the KELSEY SYKES test are made with artificial hard water. From a comparison of the factors described above it clearly appears that in the distinct tests different parameters are used and that the results of one test cannot be applied to another.
TI  - [Genetic bases for the selection of microorganisms using analogs].
AB  - The main mechanisms are considered for biosynthesis processes regulation by means of repression and inhibition with final products. On the basis of these mechanisms the state and prospects of the directed alteration of various stages in regulating the synthesis of primary and secondary metabolites, using breeding selection of mutants resistant to analogues are discussed. The main regularities are presented for using analogues of primary metabolites in the breeding strains with overproduction of various biologically active compounds.
TI  - [Primary bacterial aneurysm of the aorta. 4 cases].
AB  - The causal agent was a Salmonella in three cases and a Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in  one case. In these four patients there was no evidence of endocardities and the causal germ was verified by the bacteriological cultures of the anevrysmal lesions and/or by the blood cultures. In one patient full recovery was obtained by surgical repair after complete bacteriologic cure.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between organ extracts of gnotobiotic mice and enterobacterial common antigen.
AB  - Organs of gnotobiotic mice were assessed for an Ag (CRA) which cross-reacts with  common enterobacterial Ag(CA). To this end, extracts of homogenates of spleens, livers, paired kidneys and colons were examined for their capacities to engender humoral and cellular events in rabbits. The immjnogenicity of CRA in the rabbit cannot be predicted on the basis of CA hemagglutinin-inhibition studies alone. According to this parameter, CRA was present in mouse spleens, livers and paired kidneys but absent in colons. However, the identical preparations, including colons, primed rabbits to engender specific CA hemaglutinins after a single administration of enterobacterial CA. Also, spleens of these same rabbits were colonized with rosette-forming cells against sheep red blood cells treated with various enterobacterial sources of CA. These findings may account, in part, for the apparent refractiveness or equivocal response mice have to administered CA and infectious challenge.
TI  - [An current question in the molecular genetics of bacteria].
AB  - The author considers the possibilities and limits of extrapolation of the data by the genetics of one species of bacteria to the other. It is emphasized that even in the related bacterial species a similar localization on chromosomes was inherent only to some of the unitypical genes, by in this case as well not all the genes were grouped in the same way, and differed by their delicate structure. An idea on the significant role of genetic metabolism in the microbial evolution is being developed; particular significance is attributed to plasmides. It is supposed that foreign plasmides, particularly transmissive factors of multiple drug resistance could aid in charting the chromosomes of bacteria in which the routes of transmission of genetic information are still unknown. A conclusion was drawn on the necessity of intensification and widening the investigations on the molecular genetics of bacteria of significance for public health and public economy.
TI  - Substituted 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones.
AB  - A series of 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones has been prepared. A new synthesis of 4-alkyl-1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones involving the oxidative ring closure of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde 2-(2-hydroxyethylalkyl)semicarbazones is described. The in vitro testing of the compounds against a variety of bacteria is reported.
TI  - Inhibition of pathogenic enteric bacteria by hyperbaric oxygen: enhanced antibacterial activity in the absence of carbon dioxide.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of 24-h exposures to high-pressure oxygen in relation to environmental CO(2) were studied at 3 atm absolute (ata) and at 1 ata. Eight gram-negative, aerobic and facultatively aerobic, pathogenic enteric bacteria (Salmonella typhosa, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli) were exposed as shallow-broth cultures and agar surface cultures. Although broths supplemented with 0.2% glucose permitted some growth of Salmonella typhosa, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Shigella dysenteriae, and Shigella flexneri during exposure to high-pressure oxygen in the presence of CO(2), the other species grew only after the exposure, indicating a bacteriostatic effect. Both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects were demonstrated on the surface of Trypticase soy agar, where killing of Salmonellea typhosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly greater after exposure to pure O(2) at 3 ata than at 1 ata. At 3 ata, significantly more killing occurred upon exposure of all species (except Shigella dysenteriae and S. flexneri) on an agar surface to 100% O(2) as compared with exposure to a mixture of 95% O(2) + 5% CO(2). Thus, deprivation of CO(2) during exposure to pure O(2) enhanced the bactericidal effect of high-pressure oxygen.
TI  - Stability of bacterial mutants in saline.
AB  - By storage in 1% NaCl, genetically characterized strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were stable for more than 1 year at 4 C. This method of preservation was more effective than maintenance of the strains in stab culture.
TI  - Genetic transfer of Pseudomonas aeruginosa R factors to plant pathogenic Erwinia  species.
AB  - The R factors RP1, R68 and R91 were freely transmissible to and from Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and various plant pathogenic Erwinia spp. The antibiotic resistance spectrum of R+ Erwinia recipients was similar to those of other bacteria harboring these R factors, but maximum resistance levels differed with each recipient. The sponstaneous elimination of these factors from the Erwinia strains and the ability to transfer multiple antibiotic resistance suggest that these exist as plasmids in these hosts. Several, but not all, RP1-carrying Erwinia strains were sensitive to the RP1 specific phage PRR1. The R factor R18-1 was also transferred from P. aeruginosa to Erwinia spp. R18-1 was unstable in all Erwinia strains. Stable strains were isolated in which R18-1 could not be eliminated by sodium dodecyl sulfate and could not be transferred to other strains.

TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Demonstration of cell division by septation in a variety of gram-negative rods.
AB  - Through use of an initial fixative employing a combination of crotonaldehyde and  glutaraldehyde, septa were preserved in thin sections of dividing cells of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, and Escherichia coli when grown at 30 C in a dilute basal medium. The same procedures, however, revealed only a constrictive division process in Proteus vulgaris and Erwinia sp. This adds to the evidence that septation, although difficult to demonstrate, is the process of cell division in the enteric gram-negative rods and the pseudomonads and that constriction is a fixation artifact in these organisms.
TI  - Isolation and structure assignment of an antimicrobial principle from the volatile oil of Nigella sativa L. seeds.
AB  - Refrigeration of the volatile oil of Nigella sativa L. seeds eventuates in a crystalline substance. The chemical structure of the compound was drawn from its chemical behaviour, as well as from its UV, IR, PMR and mass spectral data. The compound was found to be thymohydroquinone: confirmation of the structure was established via the preparation of its corresponding diacetate ester. The compound was found to have high antimicrobial effect against gram positive microorganisms

TI  - Immunologic mimicry between mouse tissue and enterobacterial common antigen.
AB  - Organs of Swiss white albino and C57BL/6Ha mice were assessed for an antigen (CRA) which cross-reacts with common enterobacterial antigen (CA). To this end, supernatant fluids (HKS) and ethanol-soluble fractions (ES) of heated homogenates of spleens, kidneys, and livers were examined for their capacities to react with CA hemagglutinins and to engender humoral and cellular events in the rabbit. The immunogenicity of CRA in the rabbit can not be predicted on the basis of CA hemagglutinin neutralization studies alone; although CRA was identified in the liver extracts of both mouse strains, according to this parameter, only the liver fraction of Swiss white albino mice elicited significant numbers of rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the spleens of rabbits. Also, kidney fractions, which primed the rabbits for booster with CA, were less effective in stimulating RFC in the spleens failed to inhibit CA hemagglutination and did not prime rabbits for a CA hemagglutinin response, these same preparations clearly evoked RFC in rabbit spleens. Thus, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of CRA in target organs of mice reflect the mouse strain, extraction procedure, and testing method employed.
TI  - Pyrido(2,3-d)pyrimidine antibacterial agents. 3. 8-Alkyl- and 8-vinyl-5,8-dihydro-5-oxo-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrido(2,3-d)pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acids and their derivatives.
AB  - The preparation and antibacterial activity of a series of the title compounds (21-73) are described. These compounds were prepared from the 2-methylthio derivatives 2 and 3 via the 2-methylthio-8-substituted compounds 4-20; compounds 4-20 easily underwent displacement reactions with a variety of piperazines to afford 2-(4-substituted or unsubstituted 1-piperazinyl) derivatives 21-56, of which 21, 22, 27 and 51 with unsubstituted piperazinyl group at position 2 are converted subsequently into 57-73 by alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, or addition of isocyanates to the piperazine nitrogen. The hexahydro-1H-1,4-diazepinyl analog 74 was also prepared. The most active members in this series of compounds were found to be 8-ethyl- and 8-vinyl-5,8-dihydro-5-oxo-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrido(2,3-d)pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acids (22 and 51), both of which are more active in vitro and in vivo against gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, than piromidic acid (1). Structure-activity relationships are discussed.
TI  - Natural antibodies in healthy adults.
AB  - The serum of 100 adults living in Budapest was examined for isohaemagglutinin titre with haemaglutination, for staphylococcal-antitoxin titre with haemolysis inhibition and for bacterial antibody titre against 17 different groups of bacteria with passive haemagglutination. Antibody levels in males, except for certain bacterial antibodies, were somewhat lower than in females. The antibody titres, especially in men, decreased gradually from 20 to 50 years of age and were usually lower in Rh negative than in Rh positive persons.

TI  - Existence of a free form of a specific membrane lipoprotein in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The existence of a free form of a specific lipoprotein of molecular weight 7,200  was examined in the envelopes of several gram-negative bacteria. When the envelope proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, distinct peaks were observed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same position as the free form of the lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. However, the peak was not observed in Proteus mirabilis. The protein at the peak in S. typhimurium was shown to contain little or no histidine as expected from the amino acid composition of the lipoprotein. Furthermore, antiserum against the highly purified lipoprotein from E. coli was shown to react with the proteins from S. typhimurium and S. marcescens and to form the specific immunoprecipitates. In contrast, the protein from P. aeruginosa did not react with the antiserum at all. Thus, it is concluded that S. typhimurium and S. marcescens have the free form of the lipoprotein in their envelopes as does E. coli. P. aeruginosa contains a protein of the same size as the lipoprotein, but it is not certain whether the protein is the same structural protein as the lipoprotein from E. coli. P. mirabilis may not have any free form of the lipoprotein, may have it in a very small amount, or may have a lipoprotein of different molecular weight serving the same function.

Of all the drugs, gentamicin had the best in vitro antibacterial activity in terms of M.I.C. when considering all the species of organisms together, while spectinomycin had the least activity.An inoculum replicator was a convenient tool in carrying out the agar-plate-dilution method.A comparison of the M.I.C. values of 42 isolates of S. typhimurium with the results obtained by low level method and the Bauer-Kir-by method showed that with few exceptions, there is a general agreement.

TI  - Characteristics of PRD1, a plasmid-dependent broad host range DNA bacteriophage.
AB  - Several distinctive properties of PRD1, an icosahedral plasmid-dependent phage, are described. The drug-resistance plasmid-dependent host range of PRD1 extends beyond the P incompatibility group and includes gram-negative bacteria containing plasmids of incompatibility groups N and W. PRD1 phage will infect pseudomonads and Enterobacteriaceae containing either a P or W incompatibility group plasmid. PRD1 adsorbs to the cell wall of R(+) bacteria and thus its infectivity indicates cell wall alterations by these drug-resistance plasmid groups. PRD1 nucleic acid is duplex DNA with an estimated molecular weight of 24 x 10(6). The appearance of PRD1 in electron micrographs is suggestive of lipid content in addition to its buoyant density of 1.348 in CsCl and its sensitivity to chloroform. The latent period of PRD1 varies with the R(+) host bacterial strain used for growth of the phage.

With these sera, cross-reacting antigens were demonstrated in the following fractions obtained from tetracycline-resistant strains: envelopes of E. coli, supernatant fluid of S. typhi, and envelopes and supernatant fluid of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These antigens were not demonstrable in the corresponding fractions from tetracycline-susceptible strains.

AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

Marked variability of lysate potency was noted both years. In addition, lysate quality appeared diminished in 1972 as compared with 1971. Different lysate batches were evaluated for potency by using a variety of endotoxin preparations. Variations in batch potencies were observed, but little variation in reactivity among different endotoxin preparations was noted. Use of potent lysate batches allowed detection of endotoxin concentrations as low as 100 pg/ml. No endotoxinlike activity was observed from 11 different strains of yeast by use of the Limulus assay.

AB  - Endotoxicity of bacterial vaccines was quantitated in mice by using actinomycin D as potentiating agent. The results were compared with those obtained by the mouse weight gain test. The lethality of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide was increased 2,140 times when 12.5 mug of actinomycin D was used. The mean lethal dose values of heated and unheated pertussis vaccines were similar in the actinomycin D enhancement assay, but the unheated vaccine was significantly more toxic in the mouse weight gain test. Acetone-inactivated typhoid vaccine was slightly less toxic than the heat-phenol-inactivated vaccine in both the actinomycin D enhancement assay and mouse weight gain test. Endotoxicity of experimental vaccines prepared by extraction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was high as compared with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. The BALB/c mice were about four times more susceptible than the random bred NIH strain mice. The results indicate that the actinomycin D enhancement assay had the advantages of being more sensitive and probably more specific.
TI  - Elevated temperature technique for the isolation of salmonellas from sewage and human faeces.
AB  - Modified Moore's swabs, placed in sewers for 5 days, were used to concentrate salmonellas from sewage. Duplicate cultures of swab strips in selenite broth were incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. respectively. Salmonella organisms were recovered consistently from the swabs when the enrichment broths were incubated at 41 degrees C. However, when equal portions of the same swabs were incubated at 37 degrees C., only 22% of them yielded Salmonella organisms. These results indicate an advantage in incubating the selenite broths at 41 degrees C. rather than 37 degrees C. in attempting to isolate salmonellas from sewage.One hundred and fifty faecal samples were examined for salmonellas by culture in selenite broths incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. Twelve (8%) samples were positive at 41 degrees C. compared to only 10 (6.7%) positive samples at 37 degrees C. This difference is not statistically significant to indicate an advantage of the elevated-temperature of incubation over the conventional temperature in attempting to isolate salmonellas from human faeces. Moreover, results of the recovery rates of S. paratyphi B, S. typhi, and S. typhimurium indicate that an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C. is more appropriate for recovering salmonellas from artificially infected faecal samples than an incubation temperature of 41 degrees C. This stresses the inability of laboratory studies to mimic conditions in nature.

TI  - In-use evaluation of a commercially available set of quality control cultures.
AB  - Increasing awareness of the need for a uniform quality control program prompted an evaluation of a commercially available set (Bact-Chek) of eight organisms. A protocol was designed in which this set of control cultures was tested simultaneously in the clinical microbiology laboratory of a 400-bed hospital (the Berkshire Medical Center) and in the reference laboratories of the Bacteriology Section of the Center for Disease Control. The results indicate that the Bact-Chek organisms are essentially as advertised: they constitute a basic set of cultures for a quality control program in clinical microbiology. Ninety per cent of the media and reagents (excluding mycobacterial media and reagents) in the clinical laboratory were checked with this set of eight cultures. Additional cultures not in the set were used to check the remaining 10% of the media and reagents.

The stability of 12 plasmids in pairs was studied after 116 crosses, and five new groups were found, designated 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each plasmid studied belongs to one single group. Incompatibility between plasmids in pairs is a clear-cut phenomenon, is easy to observe, and can provide a reliable method for recognizing and classifying resistance factors, and for tracing their spread among bacterial species.

TI  - Protection of normal, lysogenic, and pyocinogenic strains against ultraviolet radiation by bound acriflavine.
AB  - The presence of bound acriflavine protects bacteria against the lethal effects of ultraviolet (UV) light, presumably because pyrimidine dimer formation is inhibited. Although acriflavine present in plating medium usually results in reduced viable counts from irradiated bacteria, no enhancement of lethal effects is observed when acriflavine is added to irradiated bacteria left in suspending buffer for 45 min before plating. Acriflavine remaining bound to the deoxyribonucleic acid of irradiated bacteria at the time they are plated likewise does not affect their survival. Protection is precisely dose-modifying unless some killing of bacteria by UV results from induction of prophage, against which bound acriflavine is less protective, or from induction of pyocin, against which there is no protection at all. It is inferred that prophage induction proceeds in part, and pyocin induction wholly, by virtue of effects of UV other than pyrimidine dimerization. The response of Escherichia coli strain B to radiation has been postulated to be attributable in part to induction of a prophage or a lethal protein; but exact dose modification was observed for this strain, to about the same extent, whether or not the irradiated organisms were grown in conditions thought to enhance the expected contribution to killing if such a mechanism were involved. Our results support the hypothesis that the inhibition by acriflavine of dimer formation is attributable to energy transfer mechanisms. They fail to support the hypothesis that shapes of survival curves (in particular the manifestation of "shoulders") can be attributed to inactivation by radiation of repair enzymes.
TI  - Enhanced toxicity for mice of vincristine and other chemotherapeutic agents with  Salmonella typhosa endotoxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The toxicity of Salmonella typhosa 0901 W endotoxin for BALB/c mice was potentiated by the administration of 375 mg of cyclophosphamide per kg, 16 mg of daunomycin per kg, 80 mg of methotrexate per kg, 8 mg of pactamycin per kg, 20 mg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid per kg, 1,000 mg of procarbazine per kg, and 1 or 4 mg of vincristine per kg. l-Asparaginase (20,000 units per kg) failed to potentiate endotoxin. Sedation following administration of 45 mg of pentobarbital per kg was prolonged in mice that had received 20,000 units of l-asparaginase per kg, 4 mg of daunomycin per kg, 120 mg of methotrexate per kg, 8 mg of pactamycin per kg, 10 mg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid per kg, 500 mg of procarbazine per kg, 2 mg of vincristine per kg, 2 mg of endotoxin per kg, or multiple doses of endotoxin. Mice pretreated with multiple endotoxin doses experienced a significant reduction in their lethal responses due to vincristine-endotoxin combinations; however, endotoxin-pretreated mice were more susceptible to vincristine alone than were normal mice. Simultaneous administration of 1 or 2 mg of vincristine per kg and 1 mg of endotoxin per kg produced greater lethality than sequential regimens. Pretreatment of mice with 65 mg of phenobarbital per kg on 4 consecutive days protected against vincristine-endotoxin combinations. Liver homogenates prepared from mice exposed previously to vincristine were capable of inactivating endotoxin. Vincristine lethality was increased by simultaneous administration of heat-killed cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from mouse feces.

One of these diazenes, diamide (diazenedicarboxylic acid bisdimethylamide), was shown to be bactericidal for pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., and Salmonella enteritidis and to cause a 1- to 2-hr delay in the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When mixtures of these four organisms were inoculated into Trypticase soy broth or Trypticase soy agar (TSA) containing diamide, P. aeruginosa grew in overnight cultures. TSA containing diamide was also used successfully to isolate pseudomonads from soil, clinical urine specimens, fish, ground beef, ground pork, and ground veal.

These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

The combinations have remarkable antibacterial properties: 3.0 x 10(5)Escherichia coli cells per ml were killed when passed through a 3.8-g column of commercially available resin treated with triiodide (volume 4 ml after treatment). In an attempt to deplete the resin-triiodide complex, 1.14 x 10(9)E. coli cells in 15 liters were passed through the column with no significant loss of effectiveness. The antibacterial capabilities of the resin-triiodide columns ranged from 10(6)Salmonella typhimurium per ml to 1.1 x 10(4)Streptococcus faecalis per ml. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested and killed at concentrations of 1.8 x 10(4) and 1.3 x 10(5) per ml, respectively. The cells were not filtered from the water. They emerged from the column in nonviable form. This was demonstrated by using (14)C-labeled bacteria. The irreversible nature of the antibacterial action was revealed when attempts to wash the damaged cells did not restore viability.

It was found that both the Enterotube and the PathoTec systems rapidly and accurately defined the position of the organisms in the major groups of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Discrepancies were noted between the results of citrate tests on Simmons' citrate-agar and in the Enterotube, as well as between Simmons' citrate-agar and the PathoTec citrate test. It was concluded that the Enterotube system provides a simple, reliable, and rapid method for the presumptive identification of Enterobacteriaceae. The major advantage of the Enterotube is that all tests are done simultaneously by inoculation from a single isolated colony.

The five enzymes were not aggregated in extracts of any of the species examined, nor are the genes encoding these enzymes clustered in those bacterial species for which genetic evidence exists. (An initial examination of the blue-green alga Anabaena variabilis indicates nonaggregation in this species also.) This situation in bacteria is in marked contrast to that found in Neurospora crassa and other fungi in which the same five enzymes are associated as an aggregate encoded (at least in the case of N. crassa) by a cluster of five genes. In addition, also in contrast to N. crassa, no evidence was obtained for more than one kind of dehydroquinase activity in any of the bacteria examined. These comparative results are discussed in relation to the origin, evolution, and functional significance of the gene-enzyme relationships existing in the early steps of aromatic biosynthesis in bacteria and fungi.

The amount of in vivo growth of each organism was followed by viable counting techniques on organ homogenates. The vaccinated mice, along with unvaccinated controls, were challenged intravenously with 1,000 ld(50) of a streptomycin-resistant strain of Salmonella enteritidis. The ability of the vaccine to protect the mice against virulent challenge correlated with the ability of the strain to establish a persisting population in the liver and spleen. Enumeration of the liver and spleen populations in the challenged mice revealed that extensive growth of S. enteritidis occurred in animals which showed "protection," as assessed by progressive mortality data. No evidence was obtained for a major role of humoral factors in the cross-protection against intravenous S. enteritidis challenge.

The pyocine preparation seems to offer advantages for the study of antibody-antigen complexes. Under the conditions of our experiments, the surfaces of the antigenic structures are saturated with antibody layers approximately 95 A in thickness, i.e., slightly less than half the accepted lengths of 7S antibody molecules. Our interpretation is that the antibody is attached by combining sites at the ends of the molecules to form loops along the surface of the antigenic structures.

Relation of polysaccharide content to some biological properties of endotoxins from mutants of Salmonella typhimurium. J. Bacteriol. 92:592-596. 1966.-Endotoxins were extracted by the phenol-water procedure from a variety of Salmonella typhimurium mutants with known differences in the composition of their cell wall polysaccharides. The lethality of these preparations for mice proved to be correlated with the complexity of the polysaccharide: endotoxin from the smooth parent strain and from rough strains with several sugars attached to the heptose-phosphate backbone were of high toxicity, whereas endotoxin from a mutant possessing only glucose attached to the heptose-phosphate backbone was less toxic, and endotoxin from a mutant possessing the backbone only was least toxic. All of these mutants yielded endotoxins that were equally capable of protecting mice against subsequent challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Material obtained from a heptoseless mutant by the phenol-water method proved to be neither toxic nor protective. The apparent dissociation of biological properties that can be achieved with the aid of endotoxin preparations from certain mutants is discussed in terms of possible mechanisms.

J. Bacteriol. 91:129-133. 1966.-In addition to the well-known O, H, K, and Vi antigens, Enterobacteriaceae produce a common antigen, which was first identified by hemagglutination tests with Escherichia coli O14 antiserum. Studies on the biological significance of this antigen by in vitro phagocytic experiments have revealed that opsonization is markedly enhanced in the presence of the corresponding antibody, rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and normal rabbit serum. This effect is specific, because Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is devoid of this antigen, is not opsonized under these conditions, and removal of the antibody by absorption markedly reduces the uptake of enteric bacteria containing the antigen. Opsonization thus represents another method for the study of this antigen-antibody system. Bactericidal tests have revealed that antibodies against this antigen, engendered in rabbits by different strains of enteric bacteria and various procedures, are bactericidal for E. coli O14 but not for other enteric bacteria, possibly due to previously demonstrated differences between the antigen moieties obtained from these microorganisms.

Data are presented which indicate that (i) the compounds must be present during the irradiation period for maximal sensitization to be observed, (ii) the sensitizing effect can be nullified by cysteine or cysteamine, (iii) the sensitizing effect occurs in a number of diverse bacterial genera, and (iv) folic acid neither sensitizes bacteria to irradiation nor prevents the sensitization caused by these antifolic agents.

Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.

Bacteriol. 88:1790-1797. 1964.-Exposure of gram-negative bacteria to cephalothin (7-[thiophene-2-acetamido]-cephalosporanic acid) revealed the formation of long filaments and large bodies, which were capable of reverting to normal cells when removed from contact with the drug. The degree of morphological change was found to be related to the concentration of antibiotic in which the organisms were suspended. The large bodies were altered by contact with solutions of varying osmolarity. Different species showed variation in the ability to develop large bodies. A relationship between antibiotic sensitivity and the capacity to resist morphological alteration was observed. Though most sensitive gram-negative bacilli were strikingly changed by exposure to cephalothin, naturally resistant ones were unaffected. Organisms made drug-resistant in vitro underwent changes in cellular form which were qualitatively the same but less intense than those which developed in parent strains originally sensitive to cephalothin.

Bacteriol. 88:1244-1248. 1964.-Supernatant fluids and filtrates from several strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, when incubated with common antigen from various enteric bacteria, will produce selective destruction of this antigen, leaving intact the simultaneously present O antigen. This effect is evidenced from hemagglutination, hemolysis, antibody absorption, hemagglutination inhibition, and immunization experiments. The Pseudomonas factor is heat-labile, being destroyed by heating at 100 C for 10 min. The action of this factor on the antigen is time-dependent and temperature-dependent, requiring incubation for 18 to 72 hr and progressing more rapidly at 50 or 56 C than at 37 C. The specificity of the reaction is indicated by the fact that supernatant fluids from cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, as well as several enzymes, such as pancreatic protease, trypsin, and lipase, have no effect on the common antigen. Utilization of the Pseudomonas factor, conceivably an enzyme, may aid in the eventual elucidation of the chemical nature of the common antigen of enteric bacteria.

TI  - ASSOCIATION OF "NATURAL" ANTIBODIES TO GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA WITH THE GAMMA-1-MACROGLOBULINS.
AB  - "Natural" antibodies to representative species of Enterobacteriaceae were found to be principally associated with the gamma(1)-macroglobulin prepared from Cohn fraction III-I of pooled human plasma. The amount of antibodies present was estimated by measuring the bactericidal, hemagglutinating, mouse-protective, and opsonophagocytic activities of this fraction. Comparison with the antibody activity of gamma(2)-globulin of Cohn fraction II showed that up to 100 times more antibody activity on a weight basis was present in the macroglobulin fraction. These findings suggest that differences between natural and immune antibody result from the physicochemical properties of 2 different classes of immune globulin.

AB  - Kohn, J. (Queen Mary's Hospital, London, England) and J. L. Reis. Bacterial nucleotidases. J. Bacteriol. 86:713-716. 1963.-The 3- and 5- nucleotidase activity in various bacterial species was investigated. Both enzymes were found in bacterial extracts in varying proportions. The nucleotidases were found to be very active in Proteus vulgaris, in which organism they were studied in detail. The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.
