TI  == removal of dental biofilms with an ultrasonically activated water stream.
AB  == acidogenic bacteria within dental plaque biofilms are the causative agents of caries. consequently, maintenance of a healthy oral environment with efficient biofilm removal strategies is important to limit caries, as well as halt progression to gingivitis and periodontitis. recently, a novel cleaning device has been described using an ultrasonically activated stream (uas) to generate a cavitation cloud of bubbles in a freely flowing water stream that has demonstrated the capacity to be effective at biofilm removal. in this study, uas  was evaluated for its ability to remove biofilms of the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans ua159, as well as actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104 and streptococcus oralis atcc 9811, grown on machine-etched glass slides to generate  a reproducible complex surface and artificial teeth from a typodont training model. biofilm removal was assessed both visually and microscopically using high-speed videography, confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), and scanning electron microscopy (sem). analysis by cslm demonstrated a statistically significant 99.9% removal of s. mutans biofilms exposed to the uas for 10 s, relative to both untreated control biofilms and biofilms exposed to the water stream alone without ultrasonic activation (p < 0.05). the water stream alone showed no statistically significant difference in removal compared with the untreated control (p = 0.24). high-speed videography demonstrated a rapid rate (151 mm2 in 1 s) of biofilm removal. the uas was also highly effective at s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and s. oralis biofilm removal from machine-etched glass and s. mutans from typodont surfaces with complex topography. consequently, uas technology represents a potentially effective method for biofilm removal and improved oral hygiene.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  == introduction: newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (pdt) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during  root canal treatment. the aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (csrbnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. methods: the interaction of csrbnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (od260nm) using enterococcus faecalis. the penetration of csrbnps into e. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm).  multispecies biofilms of streptococcus oralis, prevotella intermedia, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. the biofilms were subjected to pdt (60 j/cm(2)) using csrbnps and rose bengal. the treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and clsm. results: the csrbnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. atomic force microscopy showed adherence of csrbnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after pdt. csrbnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (p < .05). csrbnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. scanning electron microscopy and clsm confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (p < .05). conclusions: these novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced  ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == probing of microbial biofilm communities for coadhesion partners.
AB  == investigations of interbacterial adhesion in dental plaque development are currently limited by the lack of a convenient assay to screen the multitude of species present in oral biofilms. to overcome this limitation, we developed a solid-phase fluorescence-based screening method to detect and identify coadhesive partner organisms in mixed-species biofilms. the applicability of this method was demonstrated using coaggregating strains of type 2 fimbrial adhesin-bearing actinomyces and receptor polysaccharide (rps)-bearing streptococci. specific adhesin/receptor-mediated coadhesion was detected by overlaying bacterial strains immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane with a suspended, fluorescein-labeled bacterial partner strain. coadhesion was comparable regardless of which cell type was labeled and which was immobilized. formaldehyde treatment of bacteria, either in suspension or immobilized on nitrocellulose, abolished actinomyces type 2 fimbrial adhesin but not streptococcal rps function, thereby providing a simple method for assigning complementary adhesins and glycan receptors to members of a  coadhering pair. the method's broader applicability was shown by overlaying colony lifts of dental plaque biofilm cultures with fluorescein-labeled strains of type 2 fimbriated actinomyces naeslundii or rps-bearing streptococcus oralis.  prominent coadhesion partners included not only streptococci and actinomyces, as  expected, but also other bacteria not identified in previous coaggregation studies, such as adhesin- or receptor-bearing strains of neisseria pharyngitis, rothia dentocariosa, and kingella oralis. the ability to comprehensively screen complex microbial communities for coadhesion partners of specific microorganisms  opens a new approach in studies of dental plaque and other mixed-species biofilms.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == red wine and oenological extracts display antimicrobial effects in an oral bacteria biofilm model.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of red wine and its inherent components on oral microbiota were studied by using a 5-species biofilm model of the supragingival plaque that includes actinomyces oris, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar. microbiological analysis (cfu counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy) of the biofilms after the application of red wine, dealcoholized red wine, and red wine extract solutions spiked or not with grape seed and inactive dry yeast extracts showed that the solutions spiked with seed extract were effective against f. nucleatum, s. oralis and a. oris. also, red wine and dealcoholized wine had an antimicrobial effect against f. nucleatum and s. oralis. additional experiments showed almost complete and early degradation of flavan-3-ol precursors [(+)-catechin and procyanidin b2] when incubating biofilms with the red wine extract. to our knowledge, this is the first study of antimicrobial properties of wine in an oral biofilm model.

TI  == salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (sp) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. methods: titanium discs were allocated into a control group (ti) and an experimental group (tin - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). the disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). stimulated, clarified, and  filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. proteome analysis of the adsorbed sp proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms). the surface free energy (sfe) was evaluated before and after sp formation. a multispecies biofilm composed of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella  dispar, and candida albicans was developed on the sp-coated discs. viable microorganism counts were determined. the biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (clsm) with comstat  software. the biofilm organization was visualized by sem. results: the surface topography was similar in both groups. the sfe of the tin group did not differ from that of the ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins  increased the sfe in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). different proteins were identified on the ti and tin surfaces. the amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of f. nucleatum and s. oralis were higher in the tin group (p<0.001). similar biofilms were characterized by the comstat data, clsm images, and sem images. conclusion: the titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in sp composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.

TI  == pilus hijacking by a bacterial coaggregation factor critical for oral biofilm development.
AB  == the formation of dental plaque, a highly complex biofilm that causes gingivitis and periodontitis, requires specific adherence among many oral microbes, including the coaggregation of actinomyces oris with streptococcus oralis that helps to seed biofilm development. here, we report the discovery of a key coaggregation factor for this process. this protein, which we named coaggregation factor a (cafa), is one of 14 cell surface proteins with the lpxtg motif predicted in a. oris mg1, whose function was hitherto unknown. by systematic mutagenesis of each of these genes and phenotypic characterization, we found that the actinomyces/streptococcus coaggregation is only abolished by deletion of cafa. subsequent biochemical and cytological experiments revealed that cafa constitutes the tip of a unique form of the type 2 fimbria long known for its role in coaggregation. the direct and predominant role of cafa in adherence is evident from the fact that cafa or an antibody against cafa inhibits coaggregation, whereas the shaft protein fima or a polyclonal antibody against fima has no effect. remarkably, fima polymerization was blocked by deletion of genes for both cafa and fimb, the previously described tip protein of the type 2  fimbria. together, these results indicate that some surface proteins not linked to a pilus gene cluster in gram-positive bacteria may hijack the pilus. these unique tip proteins displayed on a common pilus shaft may serve distinct physiological functions. furthermore, the pilus shaft assembly in gram-positive bacteria may require a tip, as is true for certain gram-negative bacterial pili.

TI  == genetic basis of coaggregation receptor polysaccharide biosynthesis in streptococcus sanguinis and related species.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between streptococci and actinomyces promotes early dental plaque biofilm development. recognition of coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) on strains of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis by actinomyces spp. type 2 fimbriae is the principal mechanism of these interactions. previous studies of genetic loci for synthesis of rps (rps) and rps precursors (rml, gale1 and gale2) in s. gordonii 38 and s. oralis 34 revealed differences between these strains. to determine whether these differences are strain-specific or species-specific, we identified  and compared loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis in additional strains of these  species and in several strains of the previously unstudied species, s. sanguinis. genes for synthesis of rps precursors distinguished the rps loci of different streptococci. hence, rml genes for synthesis of tdp-l-rha were in rps loci of s.  oralis strains but at other loci in s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. genes for two distinct galactose epimerases were also distributed differently. hence, gale1 for epimerization of udp-glc and udp-gal was in galactose operons of s. gordonii and  s. sanguinis strains but surprisingly, this gene was not present in s. oralis. moreover, gale2 for epimerization of both udp-glc and udp-gal and udp-glcnac and  udp-galnac was at a different locus in each species, including rps operons of s.  sanguinis. the findings provide insight into cell surface properties that distinguish different rps-producing streptococci and open an approach for identifying these bacteria based on the arrangement of genes for synthesis of polysaccharide precursors.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  == introduction: in absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored  with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic  and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. aim: considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. materials and methods: determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on bd columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. incubation was done in anaerobe  condition using genbag system produced by biomerieux company. results: the microorganisms that we determined were streptococcus mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, gram-negative bacilli (bacteroides ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron) and gram-positive bacilli (bifidobacterium spp., actinomyces israelii, clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. conclusions: in cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. these bacteria  can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == streptococcus mutans protein synthesis during mixed-species biofilm development by high-throughput quantitative proteomics.
AB  == biofilms formed on tooth surfaces are comprised of mixed microbiota enmeshed in an extracellular matrix. oral biofilms are constantly exposed to environmental changes, which influence the microbial composition, matrix formation and expression of virulence. streptococcus mutans and sucrose are key modulators associated with the evolution of virulent-cariogenic biofilms. in this study, we  used a high-throughput quantitative proteomics approach to examine how s. mutans  produces relevant proteins that facilitate its establishment and optimal survival during mixed-species biofilms development induced by sucrose. biofilms of s. mutans, alone or mixed with actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis, were initially formed onto saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surface under carbohydrate-limiting condition. sucrose (1%, w/v) was then introduced to cause environmental changes, and to induce biofilm accumulation. multidimensional protein identification technology (mudpit) approach detected up to 60% of proteins encoded by s. mutans within biofilms. specific proteins associated with  exopolysaccharide matrix assembly, metabolic and stress adaptation processes were highly abundant as the biofilm transit from earlier to later developmental stages following sucrose introduction. our results indicate that s. mutans within a mixed-species biofilm community increases the expression of specific genes associated with glucan synthesis and remodeling (gtfbc, dexa) and glucan-binding  (gbpb) during this transition (p<0.05). furthermore, s. mutans up-regulates specific adaptation mechanisms to cope with acidic environments (f1f0-atpase system, fatty acid biosynthesis, branched chain amino acids metabolism), and molecular chaperones (groel). interestingly, the protein levels and gene expression are in general augmented when s. mutans form mixed-species biofilms (vs. single-species biofilms) demonstrating fundamental differences in the matrix assembly, survival and biofilm maintenance in the presence of other organisms. our data provide insights about how s. mutans optimizes its metabolism and adapts/survives within the mixed-species community in response to a dynamically changing environment. this reflects the intricate physiological processes linked  to expression of virulence by this bacterium within complex biofilms.

AB  == background: combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. we here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (opn), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. while considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of opn with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of opn on bacterial biofilms. methodology/principal findings: biofilms consisting of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of opn, as compared to biofilms grown without opn or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. confocal microscopy revealed that opn bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. the bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of opn. in particular, colonization of s. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. conclusions/significance: opn strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. if a similar effect can be observed in vivo, opn might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  == the shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. during a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was  sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). a higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. rothia dentocariosa and scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.

TI  == bacterial viability on surface-modified resin-based dental restorative materials.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. a novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(l) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. the non-modified resin was used as the standard (st). the viability of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and  human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. means, standard deviations, univariate anova and multiple comparisons with post hoc scheffe's tests were calculated. t-test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. for all tests p<0.05 was chosen. null hypothesis: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. the test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than st. but all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to st. the contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total sfe and a low polar term of sfe resulted in fewer bacteria. the material's  chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. the novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(l) active agents or with a low gamma(l) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == zoocin a and lauricidin in combination reduce streptococcus mutans growth in a multispecies biofilm.
AB  == dental caries is the most prevalent human infection. it is a multifactorial disease in which the microbial composition of dental plaque plays a major role in the development of clinical symptoms. the bacteria most often implicated in the development of caries are that group of streptococci referred to as the mutans streptococci, in particular streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. one  approach to the prevention of caries is to reduce the numbers of mutans streptococci in plaque to a level insufficient to support demineralization of the tooth. in this study, zoocin a, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, combined with lauricidin, a cell membrane active lipid, was shown over a 72 h period to selectively suppress the growth of s. mutans in a triple species biofilm. growth  of the non-target species streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus was not inhibited. in treated systems the amount of extracellular polysaccharide matrix produced was much reduced as determined by use of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. the ph of treated biofilms remained above neutral as opposed to a value of 4.3 in untreated controls. we conclude that use  of antimicrobial compounds that specifically target cariogenic bacteria should be further explored.

TI  == the exopolysaccharide matrix modulates the interaction between 3d architecture and virulence of a mixed-species oral biofilm.
AB  == virulent biofilms are responsible for a range of infections, including oral diseases. all biofilms harbor a microbial-derived extracellular-matrix. the exopolysaccharides (eps) formed on tooth-pellicle and bacterial surfaces provide  binding sites for microorganisms; eventually the accumulated eps enmeshes microbial cells. the metabolic activity of the bacteria within this matrix leads  to acidification of the milieu. we explored the mechanisms through which the streptococcus mutans-produced eps-matrix modulates the three-dimensional (3d) architecture and the population shifts during morphogenesis of biofilms on a saliva-coated-apatitic surface using a mixed-bacterial species system. concomitantly, we examined whether the matrix influences the development of ph-microenvironments within intact-biofilms using a novel 3d in situ ph-mapping technique. data reveal that the production of the eps-matrix helps to create spatial heterogeneities by forming an intricate network of exopolysaccharide-enmeshed bacterial-islets (microcolonies) through localized cell-to-matrix interactions. this complex 3d architecture creates compartmentalized acidic and eps-rich microenvironments throughout the biofilm, which triggers the dominance of pathogenic s. mutans within a mixed-species system. the establishment of a 3d-matrix and eps-enmeshed microcolonies were largely mediated by the s. mutans gtfb/gtfc genes, expression of which was enhanced in the presence of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. acidic pockets were found only in the interiors of bacterial-islets that are protected by eps, which impedes rapid neutralization by buffer (ph 7.0). as a result, regions of low ph (<5.5) were detected at specific locations along the surface of attachment. resistance to chlorhexidine was enhanced in cells within eps-microcolony complexes compared to those outside such structures within the biofilm. our results illustrate the critical interaction between matrix architecture and ph heterogeneity in the 3d environment. the formation of structured acidic-microenvironments in close proximity to the apatite-surface is  an essential factor associated with virulence in cariogenic-biofilms. these observations may have relevance beyond the mouth, as matrix is inherent to all biofilms.

TI  == structural determinants of actinomyces sortase srtc2 required for membrane localization and assembly of type 2 fimbriae for interbacterial coaggregation and oral biofilm formation.
AB  == as a pioneer colonizer of the oral cavity, actinomyces oris expresses proteinaceous pili (also called fimbriae) to mediate the following two key events in biofilm formation: adherence to saliva deposits on enamel and interbacterial associations. assembly of type 2 fimbriae that directly facilitate coaggregation  with oral streptococci and actinomyces biofilm development requires the class c sortase srtc2. although the general sortase-associated mechanisms have been elucidated, several structural attributes unique to the class c sortases require  functional investigation. mutational studies reported here suggest that the n-terminal transmembrane (tm) region of srtc2, predicted to contain a signal peptide sequence, is cleaved off the mature protein and that this processing is critical for the proper integration of the enzyme at the cytoplasmic membrane, which is mediated by the extended hydrophobic c terminus containing a tm domain and a cytoplasmic tail. deletion of this putative tm or the entire cytoplasmic domain abolished the enzyme localization and functionality. alanine substitution  of the conserved catalytic cys-his dyad abrogated the srtc2 enzymatic activity. in contrast, mutations designed to alter a "lid" domain that covers the catalytic pocket of a class c sortase showed no effect on enzyme activity. finally, each of the deleterious mutations that affected srtc2 activity or membrane localization also eliminated actinomyces species biofilm development and bacterial coaggregation with streptococci. we conclude that the n terminus of srtc2, which  contains the signal sequence, is required for proper protein translocation and maturation, while the extended c-terminal hydrophobic region serves as a stable membrane anchor for proper enzyme functionality.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == identification of interspecies interactions affecting porphyromonas gingivalis virulence phenotypes.
AB  == background: periodontitis is recognized as a complex polymicrobial disease, however, the impact of the bacterial interactions among the 700-1,000 different species of the oral microbiota remains poorly understood. we conducted an in vitro screen for oral bacteria that mitigate selected virulence phenotypes of the important periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. method: we isolated and identified oral anaerobic bacteria from subgingival plaque of dental patients. when cocultured with p. gingivalis w83, specific isolates reduced the cytopathogenic effects of p. gingivalis on oral epithelial cells. result: in an initial screen of 103 subgingival isolates, we identified 19 distinct strains from nine species of bacteria (including actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and veilonella dispar) that protect oral epithelial  cells from p. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity. we found that some of these strains inhibited p. gingivalis growth in plate assays through the production of  organic acids, whereas some decreased the gingipain activity of p. gingivalis in  coculture or mixing experiments. conclusion: in summary, we identified 19 strains isolated from human subgingival plaque that interacted with p. gingivalis, resulting in mitigation of its cytotoxicity to oral epithelial cells, inhibition  of growth, and/or reduction of gingipain activity. understanding the mechanisms of interaction between bacteria in the oral microbial community may lead to the development of new probiotic agents and new strategies for interrupting the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == ph landscapes in a novel five-species model of early dental biofilm.
AB  == background: despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque  play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. during early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated ph drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. the complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. in this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. we then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular ph landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. methodology/principal findings: strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. the architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. we employed the ph-sensitive ratiometric probe c-snarf-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm ph in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. decrease in ph in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular ph-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. conclusions/significance: the designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular ph. ratiometric ph analysis using c-snarf-4 gives detailed insight into the ph landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.

TI  == two autonomous structural modules in the fimbrial shaft adhesin fima mediate actinomyces interactions with streptococci and host cells during oral biofilm development.
AB  == by combining x-ray crystallography and modelling, we describe here the atomic structure of distinct adhesive moieties of fima, the shaft fimbrillin of actinomyces type 2 fimbriae, which uniquely mediates the receptor-dependent intercellular interactions between actinomyces and oral streptococci as well as host cells during the development of oral biofilms. the fima adhesin is built with three igg-like domains, each of which harbours an intramolecular isopeptide  bond, previously described in several gram-positive pilins. genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that although these isopeptide bonds are dispensable for fimbrial assembly, cell-cell interactions and biofilm formation,  they contribute significantly to the proteolytic stability of fima. remarkably, fima harbours two autonomous adhesive modules, which structurally resemble the staphylococcus aureus cna b domain. each isolated module can bind the plasma glycoprotein asialofetuin as well as the polysaccharide receptors present on the  surface of oral streptococci and epithelial cells. thus, fima should serve as an  excellent paradigm for the development of therapeutic strategies and elucidating  the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between cellular receptors and gram-positive fimbriae.

TI  == antimicrobial penetration and efficacy in an in vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == the penetration and overall efficacy of six mouthrinse actives was evaluated by using an in vitro flow cell oral biofilm model. the technique involved preloading biofilm cells with a green fluorescent dye that leaked out as the cells were permeabilized by a treatment. the loss of green color, and of biomass, was observed by time-lapse microscopy during 60 min of treatment under continuous flow conditions. the six actives analyzed were ethanol, sodium lauryl sulfate, triclosan, chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), cetylpyridinium chloride, and nisin.  each of these agents effected loss of green fluorescence throughout biofilm cell  clusters, with faster action at the edge of a cell cluster and slower action in the cluster center. the time to reach half of the initial fluorescent intensity at the center of a cell cluster, which can be viewed as a combined penetration and biological action time, ranged from 0.6 to 19 min for the various agents. these times are much longer than the predicted penetration time based on diffusion alone, suggesting that anti-biofilm action was controlled more by the biological action time than by the penetration time of the active. none of the agents tested caused any removal of the biofilm. the extent of fluorescence loss  after 1 h of exposure to an active ranged from 87 to 99.5%, with chx being the most effective. the extent of fluorescence loss in vitro, but not penetration and action time, correlated well with the relative efficacy data from published clinical trials.

TI  == influences of trans-trans farnesol, a membrane-targeting sesquiterpenoid, on streptococcus mutans physiology and survival within mixed-species oral biofilms.
AB  == trans-trans farnesol (tt-farnesol) is a bioactive sesquiterpene alcohol commonly  found in propolis (a beehive product) and citrus fruits, which disrupts the ability of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) to form virulent biofilms. in this study, we investigated whether tt-farnesol affects cell-membrane function, acid production and/or acid tolerance by planktonic cells and biofilms of s. mutans ua159. furthermore, the influence of the agent on s. mutans gene expression and ability to form biofilms in the presence of other oral bacteria (streptococcus oralis (s. oralis) 35037 and actinomyces naeslundii (a. naeslundii) 12104) was also examined. in general, tt-farnesol (1 mmol x l(-1)) significantly increased the membrane proton permeability and reduced glycolytic activity of s. mutans in  the planktonic state and in biofilms (p < 0.05). moreover, topical applications of 1 mmol x l(-1) tt-farnesol twice daily (1 min exposure/treatment) reduced biomass accumulation and prevented ecological shifts towards s. mutans dominance  within mixed-species biofilms after introduction of 1% sucrose. s. oralis (a non-cariogenic organism) became the major species after treatments with tt-farnesol, whereas vehicle-treated biofilms contained mostly s. mutans (>90% of total bacterial population). however, the agent did not affect significantly the  expression of s. mutans genes involved in acidogenicity, acid tolerance or polysaccharide synthesis in the treated biofilms. our data indicate that tt-farnesol may affect the competitiveness of s. mutans in a mixed-species environment by primarily disrupting the membrane function and physiology of this  bacterium. this naturally occurring terpenoid could be a potentially useful adjunctive agent to the current anti-biofilm/anti-caries chemotherapeutic strategies.

AB  == human oral bacteria live in multispecies communities in the biofilm called dental plaque. this review focuses on the interactions of seven species and the ability  of each species individually and together with other species to grow on saliva as the sole source of nutrient. community formation in biofilms in flow cells is monitored using species-specific fluorophore-conjugated immunoglobulin g, and images are captured by confocal microscopy. early colonizing veillonellae emerge  from this review of interspecies interactions in saliva as a critical genus that  guides the development of multispecies communities. highly selective interspecies recognition is evident as initial colonizers pair with early and middle colonizers to form multispecies communities that grow on saliva.

AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == efficacy of natural antimicrobials in toothpaste formulations against oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacies of two toothpaste formulations containing natural antimicrobials (herbal extracts and chitosan) against oral biofilms of different composition and maturational status. methods:  bacteria from a buffer suspension or fresh saliva were adhered for 2h to a salivary conditioning film and subsequently grown for 16h. dual-species biofilms  were prepared from actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, whilst multi-species biofilms were grown from freshly collected human saliva. biofilms were exposed to 25wt% toothpaste supernatants. a chlorhexidine-containing mouthrinse and a buffer were used as positive- and negative-controls, respectively. antibacterial efficacy was concluded from acute  killing, bacterial removal, prevention of bacterial re-deposition and continued killing during re-deposition. results: the herbal- and chitosan-based supernatants showed immediate killing of oral biofilm bacteria, comparable with chlorhexidine. moreover, exposure of a biofilm to these supernatants or chlorhexidine, yielded ongoing killing of biofilm bacteria after exposure during  re-deposition of bacteria to a matured 16h biofilm, but not to a much thinner initial biofilm formed by 2h adhesion only. this suggests that thicker, more matured biofilms can absorb and release oral antimicrobials. conclusions: supernatants based on herbal- and chitosan-based toothpastes have comparable immediate and ongoing antibacterial efficacies as chlorhexidine. natural antimicrobials and chlorhexidine absorb in oral biofilms which contributes to their substantive action.

TI  == proteases of an early colonizer can hinder streptococcus mutans colonization in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary cariogen that produces several virulence factors that are modulated by a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) signaling system. in this study, we sought to determine if proteases produced by early dental plaque colonizers such as streptococcus gordonii interfere with the subsequent colonization of s. mutans bm71 on the existing streptococcal biofilms. we demonstrated that s. mutans bm71 colonized much less efficiently in vitro on streptococcal biofilms than on actinomyces naeslundii biofilms. several oral streptococci, relative to a. naeslundii, produced proteases that inactivated the  s. mutans csp. we further demonstrated that cell protein extracts from s. gordonii, but not from a. naeslundii, interfered with s. mutans bm71 colonization. in addition, s. mutans bm71 colonized more efficiently on the sgc protease knockout mutant of s. gordonii than on the parent biofilms. in conclusion, proteases of early colonizers can interfere with subsequent colonization by s. mutans in vitro.

TI  == effect of biofilm on the repair bond strengths of composites.
AB  == composite restorations degrade during wear, but it is unknown how wear affects the composite surface and influences composite-to-composite bonding in minimally  invasive repair. here, it is hypothesized that in vitro exposure of composites to oral biofilm yields clinically relevant degradation of composite surfaces, and its influence on composite-to-composite bonding is determined. biofilms on composite surfaces in vitro increased their roughness and decreased filler particle exposure, except for a microhybrid composite, similar to effects of clinical wear in palatal appliances. failure shear stresses after intermediate-adhesive-resin application were significantly lower after aging by in vitro exposure to biofilms, while silica-coating maintained the same failure stress levels as in non-aged composites. failure modes were predominantly cohesive after silica-coating, while intermediate-adhesive-resin application yielded more adhesive failure. it is concluded that in vitro exposure to oral biofilm is a clinically relevant aging condition, and that silica-coating is to be preferred for the repair of aged composites.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

TI  == potential of shock waves to remove calculus and biofilm.
AB  == effective calculus and biofilm removal is essential to treat periodontitis. sonic and ultrasonic technologies are used in several scaler applications. this was the first feasibility study to assess the potential of a shock wave device to remove  calculus and biofilms and to kill bacteria. ten extracted teeth with visible subgingival calculus were treated with either shock waves for 1 min at an energy  output of 0.4 mj/mm(2) at 3 hz or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler at medium  power setting for 1 min, which served as a control. calculus was determined before and after treatment planimetrically using a custom-made software using a grey scale threshold. in a second experiment, multispecies biofilms were formed on saliva-preconditioned bovine enamel discs during 64.5 h. they were subsequently treated with shock waves or the ultrasonic scaler (n = 6/group) using identical settings. biofilm detachment and bactericidal effects were then assessed. limited efficiency of the shock wave therapy in terms of calculus removal was observed: only 5% of the calculus was removed as compared to 100% when ultrasound was used (p </= 0.0001). however, shock waves were able to significantly reduce adherent bacteria by three orders of magnitude (p </= 0.0001). the extent of biofilm removal by the ultrasonic device was statistically similar. only limited bactericidal effects were observed using both methods. within the limitations of this preliminary study, the shock wave device was not able to reliably remove calculus but had the potential to remove biofilms by three log steps. to increase the efficacy, technical improvements are still required. this novel noninvasive intervention, however, merits further investigation.

TI  == structure and molecular characterization of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide 10f by carbohydrate engineering in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although closely related at the molecular level, the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of serotype 10f streptococcus pneumoniae and coaggregation receptor polysaccharide (rps) of streptococcus oralis c104 have distinct ecological roles. cps prevents phagocytosis of pathogenic s. pneumoniae, whereas rps of commensal s. oralis functions as a receptor for lectin-like adhesins on other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. results from high resolution nmr identified  the recognition region of s. oralis rps (i.e. galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha) in the hexasaccharide repeat of s. pneumoniae cps10f. the failure of this polysaccharide to support fimbriae-mediated adhesion of actinomyces naeslundii was explained by the position of galf, which occurred as a branch in cps10f rather than within the linear polysaccharide chain, as in rps. carbohydrate engineering of s. oralis rps with wzy from s. pneumoniae attributed formation of  the galf branch in cps10f to the linkage of adjacent repeating units through sub  terminal galnac in galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha rather than through terminal  galf, as in rps. a gene (wcrd) from serotype 10a s. pneumoniae was then used to engineer a linear surface polysaccharide in s. oralis that was identical to rps except for the presence of a beta1-3 linkage between galf and galnacbeta1-3galalpha. this polysaccharide also failed to support adhesion of a.  naeslundii, thereby establishing the essential role of beta1-6-linked galf in recognition of adjacent galnacbeta1-3galalpha in wild-type rps. these findings, which illustrate a molecular approach for relating bacterial polysaccharide structure to function, provide insight into the possible evolution of s. oralis rps from s. pneumoniae cps.

TI  == energy transfer, volumetric expansion, and removal of oral biofilms by non-contact brushing.
AB  == non-contact removal of oral biofilms offers advantages beyond the reach of bristles, but it is unknown how energy transfer for removal from brush-to-biofilm occurs. in the present study we evaluated non-contact, oral biofilm removal by oscillating-rotating and sonic toothbrushes, and their acoustic output up to 6 mm distance. whereas some brushes removed biofilm when used at a distance of up to 6 mm, others lost efficacy at a distance of 2-4 mm from the biofilm. loss of efficacy was accompanied with high standard deviations and volumetric biofilm expansion. both sonic and oscillating-rotating brushes caused fluid flows and the inclusion of air-bubbles, while non-contact acoustic energy-transfer was demonstrated to decay with distance for both types of brushes. we put forward the following mechanism for non-contact removal: (i) brush energy is absorbed by biofilm, resulting in the visco-elastic expansion of the biofilm; (ii) if the energy absorbed is sufficient and deformation is beyond the yield point, biofilm  removal occurs; and (iii) if deformation is in the plastic range but below the yield point (i.e. at the limiting distance for non-contact removal), biofilm is expanded but not removed.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases modulate the establishment of microcolonies within multispecies biofilms.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a key contributor to the formation of the extracellular polysaccharide (eps) matrix in dental biofilms. the exopolysaccharides, which are mostly glucans synthesized by streptococcal glucosyltransferases (gtfs), provide  binding sites that promote accumulation of microorganisms on the tooth surface and further establishment of pathogenic biofilms. this study explored (i) the role of s. mutans gtfs in the development of the eps matrix and microcolonies in  biofilms, (ii) the influence of exopolysaccharides on formation of microcolonies, and (iii) establishment of s. mutans in a multispecies biofilm in vitro using a novel fluorescence labeling technique. our data show that the ability of s. mutans strains defective in the gtfb gene or the gtfb and gtfc genes to form microcolonies on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surfaces was markedly disrupted. however, deletion of both gtfb (associated with insoluble glucan synthesis) and gtfc (associated with insoluble and soluble glucan synthesis) is required for the maximum reduction in eps matrix and biofilm formation. s. mutans grown with sucrose in the presence of streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii steadily formed exopolysaccharides, which allowed the initial clustering of bacterial cells and further development into highly structured microcolonies. concomitantly, s. mutans became the major species in the mature biofilm. neither  the eps matrix nor microcolonies were formed in the presence of glucose in the multispecies biofilm. our data show that gtfb and gtfc are essential for establishment of the eps matrix, but gtfb appears to be responsible for formation of microcolonies by s. mutans; these gtf-mediated processes may enhance the competitiveness of s. mutans in the multispecies environment in biofilms on tooth surfaces.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 21. enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == impact of hydrodynamics on oral biofilm strength.
AB  == mechanical removal of oral biofilms is ubiquitously accepted as the best way to prevent caries and periodontal diseases. removal effectiveness strongly depends on biofilm strength. to investigate the influence of hydrodynamics on oral biofilm strength, we grew single- and multi-species biofilms of streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii tv14-j1, and full dental plaque at shear rates ranging from 0.1 to 50 1/sec and measured their compressive strength. subsequently, biofilm architecture was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. multi-species biofilms were stronger than single-species biofilms, with strength values ranging from 6 to 51 pa and from 5 to 17 pa, respectively. in response to increased hydrodynamic shear, biofilm strength decreased, and architecture changed from uniform carpet-like to more "fluffy" with higher thickness. s. oralis biofilms grown under variable shear of 7 and 50 1/sec possessed properties intermediate of those measured at the respective single shears.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

TI  == transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque ph decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low ph is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. the acidification also influences plaque bacteria. severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. we, therefore, investigated the effects  of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, lactobacillus paracasei, and actinomyces naeslundii were used. effects of physiological acidification at ph 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at ph 4.0-7.0, were  investigated. results: mutans streptococci and lactobacillus grew at ph 4.0 but the growth of s. sanguinis and s. oralis ceased below ph 4.2 and ph 4.2-4.4, respectively. acidification at ph 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and actinomyces, respectively. furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of s. sanguinis, s. oralis and actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental ph had returned to 7.0. the acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and lactobacillus.  conclusions: these results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.

TI  == oral biofilm models for mechanical plaque removal.
AB  == in vitro plaque removal studies require biofilm models that resemble in vivo dental plaque. here, we compare contact and non-contact removal of single and dual-species biofilms as well as of biofilms grown from human whole saliva in vitro using different biofilm models. bacteria were adhered to a salivary pellicle for 2 h or grown after adhesion for 16 h, after which, their removal was evaluated. in a contact mode, no differences were observed between the manual, rotating, or sonic brushing; and removal was on average 39%, 84%, and 95% for streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundii, respectively, and 90% and 54% for the dual- and multi-species biofilms, respectively. however, in a non-contact mode, rotating and sonic brushes still removed considerable numbers of bacteria (24-40%), while the manual brush as a control (5-11%) did not. single a. naeslundii and dual-species (a. naeslundii and s. oralis) biofilms were more difficult to remove after 16 h growth than after 2  h adhesion (on average, 62% and 93% for 16- and 2-h-old biofilms, respectively),  while in contrast, biofilms grown from whole saliva were easier to remove (97% after 16 h and 54% after 2 h of growth). considering the strong adhesion of dual-species biofilms and their easier more reproducible growth compared with biofilms grown from whole saliva, dual-species biofilms of a. naeslundii and s. oralis are suggested to be preferred for use in mechanical plaque removal studies in vitro.

AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == multi-species biofilm formation on dental materials and an adhesive patch.
AB  == purpose: this laboratory study assessed the influence of surface roughness and contact time on the formation of a multi-species biofilm on dental materials (adhesive patch, composite, amalgam and enamel). materials and methods: rough and smooth specimens of each material were prepared and the mean surface roughness was assessed profilometrically. the biofilms were then allowed to grow either for 15 min or 15 h respectively on saliva-preconditioned specimens of each material,  and colony-forming units on blood agar were counted (n = 9/group) surface morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope. results: no difference was found in the biofilm formation rate among all the materials that were tested. after a short incubation period, a statistical significant difference between smooth and rough samples could be detected on amalgam and on the resin composite material (p < or = 0.001). conclusions: surface roughness may influence the initial biofilm adherence, but differences vanish following growth  and maturation. the multi-species biofilm offers a reliable laboratory model for  studying plaque formation.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 requires actinomyces naeslundii atcc 43146 for growth on saliva in a three-species community that includes streptococcus oralis  34.
AB  == formation of dental plaque is a developmental process involving initial and late  colonizing species that form polymicrobial communities. fusobacteria are the most numerous gram-negative bacteria in dental plaque, but they become prevalent after the initial commensal colonizers, such as streptococci and actinomyces, have established communities. the unusual ability of these bacteria to coaggregate with commensals, as well as pathogenic late colonizers, has been proposed to facilitate colonization by the latter organisms. we investigated the integration  of fusobacterium nucleatum into multispecies communities by employing two in vitro models with saliva as the sole nutritional source. in flow cell biofilms, numbers of cells were quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilms were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr (q-pcr) using species-specific primers. unable to grow as single-species biofilms, f. nucleatum grew in two-species biofilms with actinomyces naeslundii but not with streptococcus oralis. however, enhanced growth of fusobacteria was observed in three-species biofilms, indicating that there was multispecies cooperation. importantly, these community dynamics yielded an 18-fold increase in the f. nucleatum biomass between 4 h and 18 h in the flow cell inoculated with three species. q-pcr analysis of static biofilms revealed that maximum growth of  the three species occurred at 24 h to 36 h. lower numbers of cells were observed  at 48 h, suggesting that saliva could not support higher cell densities as the sole nutrient. integration of f. nucleatum into multispecies commensal communities was evident from the interdigitation of fusobacteria in coaggregates  with a. naeslundii and s. oralis and from the improved growth of fusobacteria, which was dependent on the presence of a. naeslundii.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  == the plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. a quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis (p <0.05) and of porphyromonas gingivalis and s. oralis. amylase significantly (p <0.05) increased the coaggregation of a. naeslundii versus fusobacterium nucleatum and a. naeslundii versus p. gingivalis. concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological  perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). similar dosing and analysis of multiple sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. a short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model  was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. in summary, although hydrolytic  enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. in contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == zinc and copper play a role in coaggregation inhibiting action of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aim: we investigated the mechanisms of adherence of salivary and serum proteins, which mimic gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), to porphyromonas gingivalis, and the effects of these adhered proteins on coaggregation and hemagglutination properties. methods: the amounts of salivary and serum proteins  adhering to p. gingivalis were determined using (3)h-labeled and non-labeled proteins. the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and streptococcus oralis or streptococcus gordonii was observed. hemagglutination was evaluated using sheep erythrocytes. proteins that interacted with zinc or copper in saliva and serum and on p. gingivalis were examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results: the amount of salivary or serum proteins that adhered to the surface of p. gingivalis strains was increased by cations, especially zinc and copper ions. the pretreatment of bacterial cells with salivary or serum proteins before the assay inhibited coaggregation with gram-positive bacteria and hemagglutination. these phenomena were enhanced by the presence of zinc or copper ions during the pretreatment of p. gingivalis with proteins. we detected protein bands that were related to these cations in saliva  and serum and on p. gingivalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that zinc and copper ions markedly enhanced the adhesion and accumulation of salivary and serum proteins on cells of p. gingivalis and inhibited the coaggregation and hemagglutination of p. gingivalis. these cations might be useful for limiting the settlement of p. gingivalis in the gingival sulcus with the goal of preventing periodontal disease.

TI  == autoinducer-2 is produced in saliva-fed flow conditions relevant to natural oral  biofilms.
AB  == aims: we evaluated the ability of a dual-species community of oral bacteria to produce the universal signalling molecule, autoinducer-2 (ai-2), in saliva-fed biofilms. methods and results: streptococcus oralis 34, s. oralis 34 luxs mutant  and actinomyces naeslundii t14v were grown as single- and dual-species biofilms within sorbarods fed with 25% human saliva. ai-2 concentration in biofilm effluents was determined by the vibrio harveyi bb170 bioluminescence assay. after homogenizing the sorbarods to release biofilm cells, cell numbers were determined by fluorometric analysis of fluorescent antibody-labelled cells. after 48 h, dual-species biofilm communities of interdigitated s. oralis 34 and a. naeslundii t14v contained 3.2 x 10(9) cells: fivefold more than single-species biofilms. however, these 48-h dual-species biofilms exhibited the lowest concentration ratio of ai-2 to cell density. conclusions: oral bacteria produce ai-2 in saliva-fed biofilms. the decrease of more than 10-fold in concentration ratio seen between 1 and 48 h in s. oralis 34-a. naeslundii t14v biofilms suggests that peak production of ai-2 occurs early and is followed by a very low steady-state level. significance and impact of the study: high oral bacterial biofilm densities may be achieved by inter-species ai-2 signalling. we propose that low concentrations of ai-2 contribute to the establishment of oral commensal biofilm  communities.

TI  == influence of a chitosan on oral bacterial adhesion and growth in vitro.
AB  == generally, mechanical plaque control without chemical support is insufficient to  prevent oral diseases, and an ongoing quest exists for new antimicrobials for use in oral healthcare. chitosans are polycationic, naturally occurring antimicrobials that are rapidly finding their way into oral healthcare. in this study we determined the effects of pellicle treatment with chitosan on bacterial  adhesion and growth. chitosan caused a reduction in bacterial adhesion and was responsible for bacterial death upon contact compared with a buffer control. exposure of adhering bacteria to a chitosan solution or a buffer control did not  cause detachment, but the chitosan solution left a small proportion of the adhering bacteria alive. growth after exposure to chitosan was similar to (streptococcus mutans atcc700610, streptococcus oralis hm1, streptococcus sobrinus hg1025) or less than (s. mutans ns, actinomyces naeslundii hm1) that of  the control, while biofilm viability after chitosan treatment was lower than that of the control, except for s. oralis hm1. therefore, chitosan is a promising antimicrobial for use in oral healthcare.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. methods: fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using 34 genomic dna probes. the  results were analyzed statistically by mann-whitney u-test at a 5% significance level. results: the most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) treponema denticola (58%); and (6) streptococcus intermedius (49%). the most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1)  c. rectus (90%); (2) t. denticola (88%); (3) s. intermedius (77%); (4) g. morbilorum (73%); (5) streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) c. ochracea (63%); (7) s. gordonii (55%); (8) streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) leptotrichia buccalis (51%). except for peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (p<.05). groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (p<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal  samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. conclusions: root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. a large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

TI  == salivary gel-forming mucin muc5b--a nutrient for dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == introduction: model systems with oral bacteria from dental plaque have demonstrated that the utilization of complex glycoproteins as a food source cannot be undertaken by single species but requires concerted degradation by a multi-species consortium, with each member contributing one or a few hydrolytic enzymes. unlike previous studies, the aim of the present investigation was to explore the ability of fresh dental plaque to degrade salivary mucin, muc5b, isolated by methods designed to retain intact the natural polymeric structure and physiological conformation, in an attempt to mimic the naturally occurring interaction between the oral microbiota and salivary mucins. methods: human salivary muc5b was isolated from whole saliva by density-gradient centrifugation  and incubated with freshly isolated supragingival dental plaque with samples subjected to fluorescent staining for viability and metabolic activity. in addition, the degradation of muc5b oligosaccharide side chains was studied using  a lectin assay, recognizing three different carbohydrate epitopes commonly found  on mucin oligosaccharide side chains. results: the addition of purified salivary  muc5b elicited a strong metabolic response from the biofilm cells, whereas individual strains of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii isolated from the same plaque were not able to utilize the muc5b. the degradation of terminal saccharide moieties on the muc5b was demonstrated by a marked decrease in both sialic acid and fucose reactivity. conclusion: these results have shown that dental plaque is capable of utilizing human salivary muc5b as a nutrient source, a process possibly requiring the synergistic degradation of the molecule  by a consortium of oral bacteria in the plaque community.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

AB  == aim: to compare effects of three cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) formulations with and without alcohol and tween80 on physico-chemical properties of salivary pellicles, bacterial detachment in vitro and bacterial killing in vivo. material  and methods: adsorption of cpc to salivary pellicles in vitro was studied using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurements. adhesion and detachment of a co-adhering bacterial pair was determined in vitro using a flow chamber. killing was evaluated after live/dead staining after acute single use in vivo on 24- and 72-h-old plaques after 2-week continuous use. results: the most pronounced effects on pellicle surface chemistry and hydrophobicity were observed after treatment with the alcohol-free formulation, while the pellicle thickness was not affected by any of the formulations. all cpc formulations detached up to 33% of the co-adhering pair from pellicle surfaces. bacterial aggregate sizes during de novo deposition were enhanced after treatment with the  alcohol-free formulation. immediate and sustained killing in 24 and 72 h plaques  after in vivo, acute single use as well as after 2-week continuous use were highest for the alcohol-free formulation. conclusions: cpc bioavailability in a formulation without alcohol and tween80 could be demonstrated through measures of pellicle surface properties and bacterial interactions in vitro as well as bacteriocidal actions on oral biofilms in vivo.

TI  == direct visualization of spatial and temporal patterns of antimicrobial action within model oral biofilms.
AB  == a microscopic method for noninvasively visualizing the action of an antimicrobial agent inside a biofilm was developed and applied to describe spatial and temporal patterns of mouthrinse activity on model oral biofilms. three species biofilms of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown in glass capillary flow cells. bacterial cells were stained with the fluorogenic esterase substrate calcien am (cam). loss of green fluorescence upon  exposure to an antimicrobial formulation was subsequently imaged by time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy. when an antimicrobial mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine digluconate was administered, a gradual loss of green fluorescence  was observed that began at the periphery of cell clusters where they adjoined the flowing bulk fluid and progressed inward over a time period of several minutes. image analysis was performed to quantify a penetration velocity of 4 mum/min. an  enzyme-based antimicrobial formulation led to a gradual, continually slowing loss of fluorescence in a pattern that was qualitatively different from the behavior observed with chlorhexidine. ethanol at 11.6% had little effect on the biofilm. none of these treatments resulted in the removal of biomass from the biofilm. most methods to measure or visualize antimicrobial action in biofilms are destructive. spatial information is important because biofilms are known for their structural and physiological heterogeneity. the cam staining technique has  the potential to provide information about the rate of antimicrobial penetration, the presence of tolerant subpopulations, and the extent of biomass removal effected by a treatment.

TI  == effects of amine fluoride on biofilm growth and salivary pellicles.
AB  == the amine fluoride (amf) n'-octadecyl-trimethylene-diamine-n,n,n'-tris(2-ethanol)-dihydro-fluoride is a cationic antimicrobial which can have beneficial effects on plaque formation. here, we determine changes in pellicle and bacterial cell surface properties of the strains actinomyces naeslundii hm1, streptococcus mutans ns, s.mutans atcc 700610, s. sobrinus hg1025 and s. oralis hm1 upon adsorption of this amf and accompanying effects on bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth. in vitro pellicles had a zeta potential of -12 mv that became less negative upon adsorption of amf.  the chemical functionalities in which carbon and oxygen were involved changed after amf adsorption and amf-treated pellicles had a greater surface roughness than untreated pellicles. water contact angles in vitro decreased from 56 to 45 degrees upon amf treatment, which corresponded with water contact angles (44 degrees ) measured intraorally on the front incisors of volunteers immediately after using an amf-containing toothpaste. all bacterial strains were negatively charged and their isoelectric points (iep) increased upon amf adsorption. minimal inhibitory concentrations were smallest for strains exhibiting the largest increase in iep. adhesion to salivary pellicles and biofilm growth of the mutans  streptococcal strains were significantly reduced after amf treatment, but not of  a. naeslundii or s. oralis. however, regardless of the strain involved, biofilm viability decreased significantly after amf treatment. the electrostatic interaction between cationic amf and negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces is pivotal in establishing reduced biofilm formation by amf through a combination of effects on initial adhesion and killing. the major effect of amf treatment, however, was a reduction brought about in biofilm viability.

TI  == a novel tem contrasting technique for extracellular polysaccharides in in vitro biofilms.
AB  == in the past, the visualization of the extracellular matrix of biofilms on an ultrastructural level was hampered by shrinkage artifacts. in addition, the reproducible contrasting of extracellular polysaccharides (eps) has not satisfactorily been solved. here we describe a method overcoming these difficulties, which produces artifact-free transmission electron microscopic (tem) images using multispecies biofilms grown in vitro. sufficient contrast was  achieved by replacing schiff's reagent with the osmiophilic amino acid methionine. in addition, shrinkage was avoided by replacing the classical dehydration agents with ethylene glycol and 1,2-pentanediol. applying this method provided images of biofilms with an intact matrix in which differentially contrasted bacteria were embedded. all six members of the biofilm consortium (streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus oralis, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium  nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and candida albicans) could be distinguished.  within the matrix, structural differences of eps, probably due to different proportions of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 linkages, were apparent. fibrilar polysaccharides were evident around microcolonies of s. sobrinus, and fluffy polysaccharides were detected in the vicinity of s. oralis microcolonies. the ultrastructure of biofilms prepared for tem using this method allows the imaging  of undistorted eps as well as the differentiated contrasting of the six microbial species of the in vitro biofilm model. this is a major step forward in determining the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms on an ultrastructural level.

TI  == sequence of oral bacterial co-adhesion and non-contact brushing.
AB  == non-contact plaque removal offers advantages in interproximal spaces, fissures, and pockets. it requires the generation of strong fluid flows and the inclusion of air bubbles to become effective. a pair of co-adhering streptococci and actinomyces has been used previously to demonstrate non-contact removal by sonic  brushing. here we determined the influence of the sequence of co-adhesion of streptococci and actinomyces on non-contact removal from a salivary pellicle by rotary and sonic brushing. after bacterial adhesion, pellicles were brushed in a  wet and immersed state, with a distance up to 4 mm to the bristle tips. bacteria  adhering to pellicles from the sequence streptococci followed by actinomyces appeared more difficult to remove and left more large co-aggregates than from the sequence actinomyces followed by streptococci. at contact, rotary and sonic brushing performed equally well in bacterial removal, while at 4 mm, both had lost some efficacy.

AB  == ozone gas and photodynamic therapy (pdt) have been claimed to be antimicrobially  effective. this study assessed their antimicrobial potential in vitro. mature six-species oral biofilms were treated as follows (n = 9 per group): (i) a 60-s application of gasiform vacuum-ozone or vacuum alone (on wet or air-dried biofilm samples); (ii) pdt (i.e. methylene blue in combination with or without a diode soft laser, and a soft laser alone); or (iii) antimicrobial solutions: immersion  of biofilms for 60 s in 0.2 and 2% chlorhexidine or in 0.5 and 5% hypochlorite solution. treatment with chlorhexidine or hypochlorite served as a positive control, whereas untreated samples served as negative controls. colony-forming units on blood agar were counted. only the 5% hypochlorite solution was able to totally eliminate the microorganisms in the biofilm. the observed reduction of viable counts by vacuum-ozone application and pdt was less than one log(10) step. under the conditions of the current study, gasiform ozone and pdt had a minimal effect on the viability of microorganisms organized in a cariogenic biofilm.

TI  == efficacy and mechanisms of non-antibacterial, chemical plaque control by dentifrices--an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: the provision of antiplaque benefits to dentifrices assists patients  in improving hygiene and reducing susceptibility to gingivitis and caries. chemical plaque control involves different mechanisms and is mostly associated with antibacterial effects, but also includes effects on pellicle surface chemistry to improve cleansing or discourage renewed plaque formation. it is the  aim of this paper to analyze in vitro detachment of co-aggregating oral actinomyces and streptococci from pellicle surfaces by dentifrice supernates and  to study subsequent de novo streptococcal deposition. methods: detachment by dentifrices of a co-adhering bacterial pair was studied in the parallel plate flow chamber on a 16 h pellicle coated surface. after detachment by perfusing the chamber with a dentifrice, re-deposition was initiated by flowing with a fresh streptococcal suspension. the dentifrices included both a regular, sls-fluoride based formulation as well a pyrophosphate, anticalculus and antimicrobial formulations. results: all dentifrice supernates containing sls were effective in detaching co-adhering bacteria from pellicles surfaces, except in combination with snf(2). when hexametaphosphate was added immediate detachment was relatively low, but continued even during re-deposition. the re-deposition of streptococci after detachment by other, naf containing dentifrices involved relatively few large aggregates, presumably because fluoride was able to block bi-dentate calcium binding sites on the bacterial cell surfaces, mediating co-adhesion. when pyrophosphate was present in addition to naf, re-deposition involved significantly more large aggregates, likely because pyrophosphate served as a bi-dentate bridge between calcium bound on the bacterial cell surfaces. conclusion: commercially available dentifrice formulations differ in their ability to stimulate bacterial detachment from pellicles and dependent on their composition yield the formation of large co-adhering aggregates of actinomyces and streptococci in de novo deposition.

AB  == 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (dpd), a product of the luxs enzyme in the catabolism of s-ribosylhomocysteine, spontaneously cyclizes to form autoinducer 2 (ai-2). ai-2 is proposed to be a universal signal molecule mediating interspecies communication among bacteria. we show that mutualistic and abundant biofilm growth in flowing saliva of two human oral commensal bacteria, actinomyces naeslundii t14v and streptococcus oralis 34, is dependent upon production of ai-2 by s. oralis 34. a luxs mutant of s. oralis 34 was constructed which did not produce ai-2. unlike wild-type dual-species biofilms, a. naeslundii t14v and an s. oralis 34 luxs mutant did not exhibit mutualism and generated only sparse biofilms which contained a 10-fold lower biomass of each species. restoration of  ai-2 levels by genetic or chemical (synthetic ai-2 in the form of dpd) complementation re-established the mutualistic growth and high biomass characteristic for the wild-type dual-species biofilm. furthermore, an optimal concentration of dpd was determined, above and below which biofilm formation was  suppressed. the optimal concentration was 100-fold lower than the detection limit of the currently accepted ai-2 assay. thus, ai-2 acts as an interspecies signal and its concentration is critical for mutualism between two species of oral bacteria grown under conditions that are representative of the human oral cavity.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the influence of glucosyltransferase-gene-negative (gtf-) streptococcus mutans strains unable to synthesize water-insoluble or soluble glucan on the structure and macromolecular  diffusion properties of in vitro grown mixed oral biofilms. biofilms modeling supragingival plaque consisted of actinomyces naeslundii omz 745, candida albicans omz 110, fusobacterium nucleatum kp-f2, streptococcus oralis sk 248, veillonella dispar atcc 17748t and one of the s. mutans strains ua159, omz 966, omz 937 or omz 977. biofilms were grown anaerobically on sintered hydroxyapatite  disks for 64.5 h at 37 degrees c. to perform confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses, microorganisms were stained with syto 13 and extracellular polysaccharides (eps) with calcofluor. macromolecular diffusion properties were measured following timed biofilm exposure to texas-red-labeled 70-kda dextran. results showed that replacing wild-type s. mutans by a gtfc- mutant led to an increase in the volume fraction occupied by cells from 29 to 48% and a decrease of the eps volume fraction from 51 to 33%. no such changes were observed when the s. mutans wild-type strain was replaced by a gtfb- or gtfd- mutant. the diffusion coefficient of 70-kda dextran in biofilms containing the gtfc- s. mutans was 16-fold higher than in biofilms with the wild-type strain indicating a strong macromolecular sieving effect of gtf c-generated glucans. our data demonstrate the influence of eps on the structure and macromolecular diffusion properties of  an oral biofilm model and uncover our still limited knowledge of the function of  eps in biofilms and plaque.

TI  == interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating oral bacterial pairs.
AB  == the temporo-spatial development of plaque is governed by adhesive interactions between different co-aggregating bacterial strains and species. physico-chemically, these interactions are due to attractive lifshitz-van der waals and acid-base forces, and occur despite electrostatic repulsion and with a  critical influence of temperature. the forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs have never been measured, however. the aim here, thus, is to investigate, by atomic force microscopy, whether there is a difference in interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating bacterial pairs  at 10 degrees c, 22 degrees c, and 40 degrees c. actinomyces naeslundii 147 was immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated tipless afm cantilevers, while streptococci were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated glass surfaces. upon approach, a repulsive force was measured, regardless of whether a co-aggregating or non-co-aggregating pair was involved. however, upon retraction, the co-aggregating pair exhibited larger adhesive forces and energies than did the non-co-aggregating pair. adhesive interactions between the co-aggregating pair were smallest at 40 degrees c.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

TI  == microbubble-induced detachment of coadhering oral bacteria from salivary pellicles.
AB  == the presence and maturity of the salivary pellicle influences microbial adhesion  and its tenacity in the oral cavity, posing a challenge to different plaque-control systems. some plaque-control systems rely on surface-tension forces arising from passing microbubbles sprayed over the pellicle. passage of such bubbles is accompanied by a high fluid flow, but systematic studies are lacking on the contribution of fluid flow vs. microbubbles towards plaque removal. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the detachment efficacy of laminar fluid flow (wall shear rates 11,000-16,000 s(-1)), with and without microbubbles, towards the detachment of actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, and their coadhering aggregates, from salivary pellicles formed over 2 h or 16 h from reconstituted human whole saliva. microbubbles in a fluid flow were more efficient at inducing single bacterial detachment, resulting in almost complete (97%) removal for s. oralis j22 and a 15-fold increase in a. naeslundii t14v-j1 removal as compared to the detachment caused by fluid flow alone. a. naeslundii was more difficult to remove and apparently formed the strongest bonds with high-molecular-weight proteins in 16-h pellicles. the detachment of coaggregates after 2 min left a substantial amount of adhered bacterial mass, including more than 60% of singly attached a. naeslundii on the pellicle surface, providing nucleation sites for the de novo adhesion of coadhering streptococci.

TI  == the complex oral microflora of high-risk individuals and groups and its role in the caries process.
AB  == the involvement of the oral biofilm in the caries process requires re-evaluation. the essential role of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) in the caries process is not proven. acid production by dental plaque is not dependent upon the presence of mutans streptococci; caries occurs in the absence of these species and their presence does not necessarily indicate caries  activity. other oral bacteria, non-mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp. and bifidobacterium spp., are acidogenic and aciduric. they outnumber mutans streptococci in dental plaque, and there are data which support a role for these  bacteria in the initiation and progression of caries. molecular studies demonstrate the great diversity and complexity of the flora associated with caries. many taxa identified have not been cultured and the role of these taxa is not known. we have, in mutans streptococci, good markers of disease but not necessarily the aetiological agents of the disease. considerably more research is required to investigate the transition of tooth surfaces from being intact and sound to the white spot lesion stage. a combination of conventional and molecular approaches are required to elucidate the involvement of an individual taxon and of microbial populations with particular traits in the caries process.

TI  == influence of fluid shear and microbubbles on bacterial detachment from a surface.
AB  == prevention of microbial adhesion and detachment of adhering microorganisms from surfaces is important in many environmental, industrial, and medical applications. fluid shear is an obvious parameter for stimulating microbial detachment from surfaces, but recently it has been pointed out that a passing air-liquid interface also has potential in stimulating microbial detachment. in the present study, the ability of microbubbles to stimulate detachment of bacterial strains from a glass surface is compared with the effects of fluid flow. adhesion and detachment of actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, streptococcus oralis j22, and their coadhering aggregates were studied on glass, mounted in a parallel plate flow chamber. high fluid wall shear rates (11,000 to 16,000 s(-1)) were established in a laminar flow regime in the absence and presence of microbubbles. wall shear rates stimulated detachment ranging from 70% to 30% for  s. oralis and a. naeslundii, respectively. coadhering aggregates were detached up to 54%. the presence of microbubbles in the flow increased the detachment of a. naeslundii within 2 min of flow from 40% in the absence of microbubbles to 98%, while detachment of neither s. oralis nor coadhering aggregates was affected by the presence of microbubbles. in summary, extremely high fluid flows can be effective in stimulating microbial detachment, depending on the strain involved.  the addition of microbubbles to the flow allows the detachment of tenaciously adhering bacteria not detached by flow alone, but not of adhering coaggregates.

TI  == microcalorimetric study on the influence of temperature on bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == binding isotherms and heats of interaction have been determined at 15, 25, and 40 degrees c for a coaggregating and a non-coaggregating oral bacterial pair. heats  of interaction were measured upon three consecutive injections of streptococci into an actinomyces suspension using isothermal titration calorimetry. after each injection, the number of streptococci injected remaining free in suspension was quantified microscopically and the degree of binding between the two bacterial strains was established. the coaggregating pair shows positive cooperative binding. the highest cooperativity, at 25 degrees c, correlates with a strong, macroscopically visible coaggregation. the non-coaggregating pair shows low cooperativity and lacks macroscopically visible coaggregation. interactions between the coaggregating partners seem to be mainly due to specific, enthalpically saturable and favorable binding sites. even though the enthalpic part of the interaction is saturated, cooperativity increases with consecutive injections, implying that the coaggregation phenomenon is driven by entropy gain. the change in heat capacity (deltac(p)) is positive for the non-coaggregating pair from 15-40 degrees c as well as for the coaggregating pair beyond 25 degrees c. at lower temperatures the coaggregating pair causes a negative deltac(p). the  decrease in heat capacity together with an increase in entropy is considered to be indicative of hydrophobic interactions playing an important role in the formation of large coaggregates as observed for the coaggregating pair at 25 degrees c.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic selection of microbiota surviving under dental restorations.
AB  == the effects of sealing infected carious dentine below dental restorations on the  phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota was investigated.  it was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. the available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. ten lesions were treated, and infected  dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. the baseline microbiota were composed primarily of lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus parasanguinis, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. none of these  taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mitis. the microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. the genotypic diversity of s. oralis and a. naeslundii was significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. there was significantly (p < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that  the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. we propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. the surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and ph perturbations.

AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

TI  == identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. methods and results: a 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. the bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. in the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be actinomyces species. the relative proportion of streptococci, in particular streptococcus mitis and s. oralis, increased at the expense of actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of actinomyces remained unaltered. periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythensis(bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola as well as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of  subjects. conclusion: the data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. significance and impact of the study: the early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.

TI  == path-dependency of the interaction between coaggregating and between non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a thermodynamic approach.
AB  == coaggregation, i.e. specific recognition between bacteria from different species, is a well-described phenomenon in the human oral cavity but remains physically poorly understood. with our study we aimed at elucidating some aspects of the mechanism of the coaggregation between the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis j22 and actinomyces naeslundii 147, in particular with respect to the driving force for coaggregation and its pathway-dependency. to that end, the macroscopic turbidity of the bacterial suspension, the morphology of the coaggregates, binding isotherms and heats of interaction were compared between the above-mentioned coaggregating bacterial pair and a non-coaggregating pair, streptococcus sanguis pk1889 and a. naeslundii 147. the coaggregating pair forms  large aggregates, which rapidly sediment from the suspension while the non-coaggregating pair forms only very small coaggregates that remain homogeneously suspended. coaggregation is further characterized by a high affinity between the partner cells that bind to each other in a strong cooperative mode. the interactions between both pairs occur under the release of  heat and are thus enthalpically favorable. more heat is released for the coaggregating than for the non-coaggregating pair. adding the coaggregating bacteria in steps to each other leads to saturation of enthalpically favorable binding sites. this is observed when the streptococcus is added to the actinomyces as well as when the addition is done the other way around. it is concluded that the cooperativity of the coaggregation process is based on an increase of entropy. it is furthermore shown that the density of the coaggregates as well as the heat effect of formation of these coaggregates depend on the number of steps in which the partner cells are added to each other. adding s. oralis j22 in three steps to a. naeslundii 147 results in the formation of denser coaggregates under the release of less heat, as compared to that of addition in one step. these differences point to a larger entropy increase when in a step-wise mixing the coaggregating bacteria are allowed to form more densely-packed coaggregates.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == influence of weight on removal of co-adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compared removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci from salivary pellicles by manual, rotating/oscillating electric and sonic toothbrushes, applying weights up to 240  g. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through  the chamber at 33 degrees c. on average, 34-39% of the adhering bacteria were adhering as single organisms. for co-adhering and non-co-adhering pairs, 33 and 10% of the adhering bacteria were involved, respectively, in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. brushing by hand removed 82% at low weight (40 g), which was less than by electric (93%) or sonic (92%) brushing, while for all  modes of brushing bacterial removal increased with increasing weight to 95-99%. for a non-co-adhering pair, subsequent exposure of brushed pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded only 2-16% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, regardless of the mode of brushing. for the co-adhering pair, however, de novo streptococcal adhesion to hand-brushed pellicles yielded 34-57%  of bacteria involved in large aggregates, while electric and sonic brushing left  22-35% of the bacteria involved in large aggregates. de novo streptococcal adhesion for the co-adhering pair increased with increasing weight for the electric and sonic brush in contrast to the manual brush. since a strong influence of co-adhesion is evident in de novo streptococcal adhesion, despite nearly complete removal of all actinomyces, these observations suggest that the three modes of brushing leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

AB  == established procedures use different and seemingly incompatible experimental protocols for fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure, based on fish and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), for the analysis of the spatial organization of in vitro biofilms containing both gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. biofilms composed of the six oral species actinomyces naeslundii, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus  oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, and veillonella dispar were grown anaerobically for 64.5 h at 37 degrees c on hydroxyapatite disks preconditioned with saliva. conditions for the simultaneous in situ hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were sought by systematic variation of fixation and exposure to lysozyme. after fixation and permeabilization biofilms were labeled by fish with 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes ana103 (for the detection of a. naeslundii), euk116 (c. albicans), fus664 (f. nucleatum), mit447 and mit588 (s. oralis), sob174 (s. sobrinus), and vei217 (v. dispar). probes were used as 6-fam, cy3 or cy5 conjugates, resulting in green, orange-red or deep-red fluorescence of target cells, respectively. thus, with two independent triple-hybridizations with three probes carrying different fluorescence-tags, all six species could be visualized. results show that the simultaneous investigation by fish of complex biofilms composed of multiple bacterial species with differential gram-staining properties is possible. in combination with the optical sectioning properties of clsm the technique holds great promise for the analysis of spatial alterations in biofilm composition in response to environmental challenges.

TI  == non-contact removal of coadhering and non-coadhering bacterial pairs from pellicle surfaces by sonic brushing and de novo adhesion.
AB  == coadhesion between oral microbial pairs is an established factor in the spatiotemporal development and prevalence of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque in vivo. this study compares removal and de novo adhesion of pairs  of coadhering and non-coadhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by sonic brushing on salivary pellicles in a non-contact mode as a function of the distance between the brush and the pellicle surface in vitro. first, actinomycetes were adhered to a pellicle surface, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were allowed to adhere. removal was examined by non-contact,  sonic brushing with a wetted brush on a either a wetted or a substratum immersed  to a depth of 7 mm. after brushing, de novo adhesion of streptococci to brushed pellicles was studied. for coadhering and non-coadhering pairs, 34% and 9%, respectively, of the adhering bacteria were involved in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. non-contact, sonic brushing removed up to 99% of the adhering bacteria, regardless of the state of immersion of the substratum. bacterial removal decreased with increasing distance of up to 6 mm between brush  and pellicle surface. for the non-coadhering pair, subsequent exposure of pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded about 6% of bacteria involved in  large aggregates. alternatively, de novo adhesion of the coadhering streptococcal strain to pellicles brushed on the wetted substratum yielded 31% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, but after brushing the immersed substratum only 12% of the adhering bacteria were found in large aggregates. it is concluded that non-contact sonic brushing, under immersion, removes high percentage of adhering  bacterial pairs up to a distance of 6 mm between the brush and the pellicle surface. however, non-contact, sonic brushing with only a thin wet film on the substratum may leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

TI  == effect of the environment on genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis in the oral biofilm.
AB  == the genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (424 isolates) and streptococcus oralis (446 isolates) strains isolated from two sound approximal sites in all subjects who were either caries active (seven subjects) or caries free (seven subjects) was investigated by using the repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. the plaque from the caries-active subjects harbored significantly greater proportions of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and a smaller proportion of a. naeslundii organisms than the plaque sampled from the caries-free subjects. these data confirmed that the sites of the two groups of subjects were subjected to different environmental stresses, probably determined  by the prevailing or fluctuating acidic ph values. we tested the hypothesis that  the microfloras of the sites subjected to greater stresses (the plaque samples from the caries-active subjects) would exhibit reduced genotypic diversity since  the sites would be less favorable. we found that the diversity of a. naeslundii strains did not change (chi2 = 0.68; p = 0.41) although the proportional representation of a. naeslundii was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). conversely, the diversity of the s. oralis strains increased (chi2 = 11.71; p = 0.0006) and the proportional representation of s. oralis did not change. we propose that under these environmental conditions the diversity and number of niches within the oral biofilm that could be exploited by s. oralis increased, resulting in the increased genotypic diversity of this species. apparently, a. naeslundii was not  able to exploit the new niches since the prevailing conditions within the niches  may have been deleterious and not supportive of its proliferation. these results  suggest that environmental stress may modify a biofilm such that the diversity of the niches is increased and that these niches may be successfully exploited by some, but not necessarily all, members of the microbial community.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == enthalpy of interaction between coaggregating and non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a microcalorimetric study.
AB  == bacterial adhesion and coaggregation are involved in the development of oral biofilms, called dental plaque. although various techniques have already been used to study different aspects of these bacterial interactions, microcalorimetry has not yet been applied. this paper describes how isothermal reaction calorimetry can be employed to determine the enthalpy of coaggregation between two oral bacterial pairs. for most biological processes, the enthalpy tends to reach a minimum value, reflecting the most stable state, which is directly related to the heat content of the system. the calorimeter consists of four measuring units where reaction ampoules are filled with 1.5 ml of an actinomyces  naeslundii 147 suspension, while reference ampoules are filled with buffer only.  after equilibration at 25 degrees c, 80 microl of a streptococcal suspension was  titrated into the reaction ampoules. to study possible saturation of the binding  sites on the actinomyces surface, three consecutive injections with streptococcal suspensions were done. following each injection, a 20-microl aliquot was taken from the ampoule kept outside the calorimeter and the number of free (s(f)) and bound (s(b)) streptococci was determined microscopically. experiments were carried out with a coaggregating streptococcal strain (streptococcus oralis j22)  and a non-coaggregating strain (streptococcus sanguis pk1889), serving as a control. the coaggregation enthalpy was exothermic, that is, heat was released in the reaction ampoule upon coaggregation and the heat released by the coaggregating pair minus the heat released by the non-coaggregating pair yielded  a coaggregation enthalpy of -0.015 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus for the first  injection. upon consecutive injections, the coaggregation enthalpy decreased to -0.0004 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus. comparison with enthalpy changes reported for lectin-carbohydrate binding suggests that a huge number of binding sites are involved in the formation of one bacterial coaggregate.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == coaggregation-mediated interactions of streptococci and actinomyces detected in initial human dental plaque.
AB  == streptococci and actinomyces that initiate colonization of the tooth surface frequently coaggregate with each other as well as with other oral bacteria. these observations have led to the hypothesis that interbacterial adhesion influences spatiotemporal development of plaque. to assess the role of such interactions in  oral biofilm formation in vivo, antibodies directed against bacterial surface components that mediate coaggregation interactions were used as direct immunofluorescent probes in conjunction with laser confocal microscopy to determine the distribution and spatial arrangement of bacteria within intact human plaque formed on retrievable enamel chips. in intrageneric coaggregation, streptococci such as streptococcus gordonii dl1 recognize receptor polysaccharides (rps) borne on other streptococci such as streptococcus oralis 34. to define potentially interactive subsets of streptococci in the developing plaque, an antibody against rps (anti-rps) was used together with an antibody against s. gordonii dl1 (anti-dl1). these antibodies reacted primarily with single cells in 4-h-old plaque and with mixed-species microcolonies in 8-h-old plaque. anti-rps-reactive bacteria frequently formed microcolonies with anti-dl1-reactive bacteria and with other bacteria distinguished by general nucleic acid stains. in intergeneric coaggregation between streptococci and actinomyces, type 2 fimbriae of actinomyces recognize rps on the streptococci. cells reactive with antibody against type 2 fimbriae of actinomyces naeslundii t14v (anti-type-2) were much less frequent than either subset of streptococci. however, bacteria reactive with anti-type-2 were seen in intimate association with anti-rps-reactive cells. these results are the first direct demonstration of coaggregation-mediated interactions during initial plaque accumulation in vivo. further, these results demonstrate the spatiotemporal development and prevalence  of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque.

TI  == mass transport of macromolecules within an in vitro model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the diffusion of macromolecules through an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque. polyspecies biofilms containing actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, veillonella dispar, and candida albicans were formed on sintered hydroxyapatite disks and then incubated at room temperature for defined  periods with fluorescent markers with molecular weights ranging from 3,000 to 900,000. subsequent examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the mean square penetration depths for all tested macromolecules except immunoglobulin m increased linearly with time, diffusion coefficients being linearly proportional to the cube roots of the molecular weights of the probes (range, 10,000 to 240,000). compared to diffusion in bulk water, diffusion in the biofilms was markedly slower. the rate of diffusion for each probe appeared to be constant and not a function of biofilm depth. analysis of diffusion phenomena through the biofilms suggested tortuosity as the most probable explanation for retarded diffusion. selective binding of probes to receptors present in the biofilms could not explain the observed extent of retardation of diffusion. these results are relevant to oral health, as selective attenuated diffusion of fermentable carbohydrates and acids produced within dental plaque is thought to be essential for the development of carious lesions.

TI  == effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth  of plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. in view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. methods: human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (aza), cyclosporin a (csa), tacrolimus (tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (myc). pge subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for pge subset 2 (clone e2r1). the protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. a redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. in an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (a. viscosus t14v, s. oralis h1, s. mutans 10449, c. gingivalis dr2001, a. actinomycetemcomitans y4, and m. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. results: in comparison with the  controls, the pge subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with aza, and by 77.0% with csa. the protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for aza and 17.0% for myc. furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (aza 70.7%, csa 78.2%, myc 69.8%, tac 64.0%). the most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for csa at values ranging from 21.0% (s. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (a. viscosus t14v) growth inhibition. conclusions: the present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.

TI  == selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. we examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two streptococcus thermophilus and two lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as streptococcus sobrinus omz176. two of them, strep. thermophilus ncc1561 and lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis ncc2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five  strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. in this system, lactoc. lactis ncc2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of streptococcus oralis  omz607, veillonella dispar omz493, actinomyces naeslundii omz745 and of the cariogenic strep. sobrinus omz176. these findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == electric field induced desorption of bacteria from a conditioning film covered substratum.
AB  == desorption of three oral bacterial strains from a salivary conditioning film on an indium tin oxide electrode during application of a positive (bacterial adhesion to the anode) or a negative electric current was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber. bacterial adhesion was from a flowing suspension of high ionic strength, after which the bacterial suspension was replaced by a low ionic  strength solution without bacteria and currents ranging from -800 to +800 microa  were applied. streptococcus oralis j22 desorbed during application of a positive  and negative electric current with a desorption probability that increased with increasing electric current. two actinomyces strains, however, could not be stimulated to desorb by the electric currents applied. the desorption forces acting on adhering bacteria are electroosmotic in origin and working parallel to  the electrode surface in case of a positive current, whereas they are electrophoretic and electrostatic in origin and working perpendicular to the surface in case of a negative current. by comparison of the effect of positive and negative electric currents, it can be concluded that parallel forces are more effective in stimulating bacterial desorption than perpendicular forces. the results of this study point to a new pathway of cleaning industrial and biomedical surfaces without the use of detergents or biocides.

AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

AB  == this study compares removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by hand, electric and sonic brushing from salivary pellicles. in addition, re-deposition of a co-adhering and non-co-adhering streptococcal strain to brushed pellicles was studied. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 c. pellicles with adhering bacterial pairs were brushed and the number of bacteria remaining determined. whereas sonic brushing removed nearly all adhering bacteria, greater  numbers of larger aggregates of the co-adhering pair, involving streptococcus oralis j22, were left behind after hand and electric brushing than of the non-co-adhering pair with streptococcus sanguis pk1889. re-deposition of streptococci to electrically and sonically brushed pellicles, however, was two-fold higher for the co-adhering pair than for the non-co-adhering pair. this  demonstrates a role for co-adhesion in de novo plaque formation. removal by the three different modes of brushing was not affected by the presence of fluoride, indicating that fluoride is not able to disrupt calcium bridges between co-adhering pairs. in contrast, in the presence of lactose only small aggregates  of co-adhering pair were left behind.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == bacterial detachment from salivary conditioning films by dentifrice supernates.
AB  == this study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans or actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of  buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. on average, s. sanguis was the  easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while a. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). the combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including ph, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).

TI  == mutualism versus independence: strategies of mixed-species oral biofilms in vitro using saliva as the sole nutrient source.
AB  == during initial dental plaque formation, the ability of a species to grow when others cannot would be advantageous, and enhanced growth through interspecies and intergeneric cooperation could be critical. these characteristics were investigated in three coaggregating early colonizers of the tooth surface (streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus oralis 34, and actinomyces naeslundii  t14v). area coverage and cell cluster size measurements showed that attachment of a. naeslundii and of s. gordonii to glass flowcells was enhanced by a salivary conditioning film, whereas attachment of s. oralis was hindered. growth experiments using saliva as the sole carbon and nitrogen source showed that a. naeslundii was unable to grow either in planktonic culture or as a biofilm, whereas s. gordonii grew under both conditions. s. oralis grew planktonically, but to a much lower maximum cell density than did s. gordonii; s. oralis did not  grow reproducibly as a biofilm. thus, only s. gordonii possessed all traits advantageous for growth as a solitary and independent resident of the tooth. two-species biofilm experiments analyzed by laser confocal microscopy showed that neither s. oralis nor a. naeslundii grew when coaggregated pairwise with s. gordonii. however, both s. oralis and a. naeslundii showed luxuriant, interdigitated growth when paired together in coaggregated microcolonies. thus, the s. oralis-a. naeslundii pair formed a mutualistic relationship, potentially contact dependent, that allows each to grow where neither could survive alone. s. gordonii, in contrast, neither was hindered by nor benefited from the presence of either of the other strains. the formation of mutually beneficial interactions within the developing biofilm may be essential for certain initial colonizers to  be retained during early plaque development, whereas other initial colonizers may be unaffected by neighboring cells on the substratum.

TI  == analysis of bacterial detachment from substratum surfaces by the passage of air-liquid interfaces.
AB  == a theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. bacteria (streptococcus sobrinus hg1025, streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, bacteroides fragilis 793e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 974k) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2)  was reached. for s. sobrinus hg1025, s. oralis j22, and a. naeslundii t14v-j1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for b. fragilis 793e and p. aeruginosa 974k, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. for some experimental conditions, like with p. aeruginosa 974k adhering to dds-coated glass and an air  bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. the detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain  and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. however, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. at low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high  air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. the shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. the present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms.  hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".

TI  == effects of three different infant dentifrices on biofilms and oral microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of infant dentifrices: a--with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and lactoferrin; b--with 1100 ppm of naf and sodium lauryl sulfate; c--with extract of calendula. the dentifrices were test on biofilms formed in vitro from saliva and dental plaque of infants, using  reference strains a. viscosus (atcc 43146); c. albicans (atcc 51501); l. casei (atcc 4646); s. mitis (atcc 49456); s. mutans (atcc 25175); s. oralis (atcc 35037); s. sanguis (atcc 10586); s. sobrinus (atcc 27609) and isolated clinically microorganisms c. albicans, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus and lactobacillus sp. twenty infants were chosen, who were beginning treatment at the infants clinic of the pediatric dentistry department, federal university of rio de janeiro. a pool of unstimulated saliva and a pool of dental  plaque were collected from which biofilms were produced. supernatants from each dentifrice were prepared and concentrated and diluted solutions of the dentifrices and a control sterile diluent were tested against the biofilms produced, for 1 and 3 minutes, and against the microorganisms. the results were statistically analyzed by the anova and tukey test. after the exposure of the biofilms produced both from saliva and from dental plaque, to the dentifrice b concentrated and 1/2, for 1 and 3 minutes, the viable microorganisms count (cfu/ml), compared to the controls, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). however, exposure to the dentifrices a and c concentrated and dentifrice b 1/4 and 1/8, for 1 and 3 minutes, was not significantly lethal to the biofilms. the dentifrices a and c, either concentrated or diluted (1/2 to 1/128) and the dentifrice b in the dilutions 1/16 to 1/128 did not have an antimicrobial effect  on any microorganism evaluated. for all the microorganisms evaluated, the dentifrice b concentrated and in the 1/2 dilution showed a significant antimicrobial effect, when compared with the control (p < 0.05).

TI  == validation of an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the study of biofilm structure and function mandates the use of model systems for which a host of environmental variables can be rigorously controlled. we describe a model of supragingival plaque containing actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis wherein cells are cultivated anaerobically in a saliva-based medium on hydroxyapatite discs coated with a salivary pellicle, with material and pieces of apparatus common to all microbiology laboratories. after 0.5 hr, 16.5 hrs, 40.5 hrs, and 64.5 hrs, the composition of adherent biofilms was analyzed by culture techniques, live/dead fluorescence staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. repeated independent trials demonstrated the repeatability of biofilm formation after 40.5 hrs and 64.5 hrs. brief exposures of biofilms to chlorhexidine or triclosan produced losses in viability similar to those observed in vivo. this biofilm model should prove very useful for pre-clinical testing of  prospective anti-plaque agents at clinically relevant concentrations.

TI  == spatial arrangements and associative behavior of species in an in vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == the spatial arrangements and associative behavior of actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis strains in an in vitro model of supragingival plaque were determined. using species-specific fluorescence-labeled antibodies in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the volumes and distribution of the five strains were assessed during biofilm formation. the volume-derived cell numbers of each strain correlated well with respective culture data. between 15 min and 64 h, populations of each strain increased in a manner reminiscent of batch growth. the microcolony morphologies of all members of the consortium and their distributions within the biofilm were characterized, as were interspecies associations. biofilms formed 15 min after inoculation consisted principally of single nonaggregated cells. all five strains adhered strongly to the saliva-conditioned substratum, and therefore, coadhesion played no role during the initial phase of biofilm formation. this observation does not reflect the results of in vitro coaggregation of the five strains, which depended upon the nature of the suspension medium. while the possibility cannot be excluded that some interspecies associations observed at later stages of biofilm formation were initiated by coadhesion, increase in bacterial numbers appeared to be largely a growth phenomenon regulated by the prevailing cultivation conditions.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

AB  == aim: the aim of the study was to compare the attachment of two typical strains of oral bacteria to four denture base materials. design: in vitro study. method: discs of acrylic resin denture base materials (paladon 65, polished and unpolished; palapress; microbase, polished and unpolished, and triad vlc) were placed into petri dishes with schaedler's medium, inoculated with streptococcus oralis 34 or actinomyces viscosus t14v. main outcome measures: after 24 h or 48 h the numbers of adhering bacteria were measured. results: the bacteria adhered to  all discs in similar numbers: 3-9 x 10(6)/ml (viable cell count) and 9-22 x 10(8)/ml (total cell count) for t14v, and 2-6 x 10(6)/ml (viable cell count) and  1.5-3 x 10(8)/ml (total cell count) for 34. conclusions: polishing had little effect on adherence. denture base materials are not resistant against adherence and possible surface damage by oral bacteria. therefore, thorough oral hygiene is important for denture wearers.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative  materials--an in vitro study.
AB  == three tooth-coloured, resin-based restorative materials (charisma, dyract, and pertac) were exposed to typical oral bacteria (s. mutans, s. oralis and a. naeslundii) over a period of up to 35 days. the three strains of bacteria all colonised the resin-based materials within a few hours and formed thick bacterial films. determination of the bacterial glucose consumption and lactate production  during the incubation period showed no difference from the controls which contained no resin samples. following the experimental exposure, the materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem) for possible surface damage and roughness was measured in a perthometer. little damage to the resin-based composite material surfaces (charisma, pertac) could be observed, whereas the polyacid-modified composite material (dyract) showed greater damage. there was a  significant difference in the resin surface roughness after exposure to s. mutans and to a. naeslundii. the study clearly showed that the bacteria used strongly adhered to the resin-based restorative materials. as a consequence of bacterial colonisation and/or poor oral hygiene, damage to the restorative materials might  develop. this suggests the need for dentists to evaluate personal oral hygiene, along with general indications and economic factors, in selecting materials for restorations, since the known anti-bacterial properties of amalgam are considerable.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == co-aggregation as a virulent factor of streptococcus sanguis isolated from infective endocarditis.
AB  == the pathogenicity of strains of the streptococcus sanguis group, isolated from infective endcarditis, was studied by measuring the development of subcutaneous abscesses in mice after infection with s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus either singly or as co-aggregated pairs. the pathogenicity of the co-aggregates was also examined in various viable combinations of the two bacterial species. more abscesses were formed by a. viscosus than the s. sanguis group including clinical isolates. abscess formation by co-aggregates of combinations of each isolate and  a. viscosus produced a higher percentage of abscess formation than those caused by infection with a pure suspension of a. viscosus or tested streptococci. co-aggregated cells were more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils in vivo. these results indicated that s. sanguis group streptococci isolated from infective endocarditis are able to co-aggregate and resist phagocytosis. the ability of co-aggregation of s. sanguis may serve as a survival mechanism in a host defense system and may be linked with virulence of this bacteria.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

AB  == the intraperitoneal immunization of balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus mitis, or streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable igm monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. this study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. the concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. labeled bacteria  belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces georgiae, actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. in contrast, actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. these data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.

AB  == actinomyces serovar wva963 strain pk1259 mediates intergeneric coaggregation with several oral streptococci. these lactose-inhibitable coaggregations appear to involve a 95-kda putative actinomyces adhesin in complex with type 2 fimbriae. a  coaggregation-defective strain pk2407 lacking type 2 fimbriae synthesizes the putative adhesin but appears unable to present it properly on its surface. antiserum was raised against surface sonicates of pk2407 and was absorbed with a  different coaggregation-defective mutant pk3092 that synthesizes type 2 fimbriae  but no adhesin. this absorbed antiserum specifically blocked lactose-inhibitable  coaggregation of wild-type strain pk1259 and streptococcus oralis 34 and identified a 95-kda protein in ammonium sulfate precipitates of culture supernatant of the coaggregation-defective mutant pk2407. the 95-kda secreted protein was bound to the streptococcal partner cells and to lactose-agarose affinity beads and was released by lactose from both the affinity beads and partner, indicating that the secreted and precipitated protein is biochemically active and may mediate coaggregation with streptococci.

AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == actinomyces naeslundii displays variant fimp and fima fimbrial subunit genes corresponding to different types of acidic proline-rich protein and beta-linked galactosamine binding specificity.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 bind to acidic proline-rich proteins (aprps) and statherin via type 1 fimbriae and to beta-linked galactosamine (galnacbeta) structures via type 2 fimbriae. in addition, a. naeslundii displays  two types of binding specificity for both aprps-statherin and galnacbeta, while actinomyces odontolyticus binds to unknown structures. to study the molecular basis for these binding specificities, dna fragments spanning the entire or central portions of fimp (type 1) and fima (type 2) fimbrial subunit genes were amplified by pcr from strains of genospecies 1 and 2 and hybridized with dna from two independent collections of oral actinomyces isolates. isolates of genospecies 1 and 2 and a. odontolyticus, but no other actinomyces species, were positive for hybridization with fimp and fima full-length probes irrespective of binding to aprps and statherin, galnacbeta, or unknown structures. isolates of genospecies 1 and 2, with deviating patterns of galnacbeta1-3galalpha-o-ethyl-inhibitable coaggregation with streptococcus oralis ss34 and mpb1, were distinguished by a fima central probe from genospecies 1 and 2, respectively. furthermore, isolates  of genospecies 1 and 2 displaying preferential binding to aprps over statherin were positive with a fimp central probe, while a genospecies 2 strain with the opposite binding preference was not. the sequences of fimp and fima central gene  segments were highly conserved among isolates with the same, but diversified between those with a variant, binding specificity. in conclusion, a. naeslundii exhibits variant fimp and fima genes corresponding to diverse aprp and galnacbeta specificities, respectively, while a. odontolyticus has a genetically related but distinct adhesin binding specificity.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == characterization of a novel n-acetylneuraminic acid-specific fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 adhesin.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5h11, 14c7, 19f2 and 29c12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of  f. nucleatum pk1594 with actinomyces israelii pk16. they were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including streptococcus oralis h1, s. oralis j22, capnocytophaga ochracea atcc33596, prevotella denticola pk1277 and prevotella intermedia pk1511. all of these interactions were completely inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid. neither n-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody  5h11 had any inhibitory effect on other f. nucleatum pk1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. the results indicate that f.  nucleatum pk1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid.

TI  == identification of a gene involved in assembly of actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbriae.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbrial structural subunit gene, fima, and the 3' flanking dna region was determined. the fima gene encoded a 535-amino-acid precursor subunit protein (fima) which included both n-terminal leader and c-terminal cell wall sorting sequences. a second gene, designated orf365, that encoded a 365-amino-acid protein which contained a putative transmembrane segment was identified immediately 3' to fima. mutants in which either fima or orf365 was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene did not participate in type 2 fimbriae-mediated coaggregation with streptococcus oralis 34. type 2 fimbrial antigen was not detected in cell extracts of the fima mutant by western blotting with anti-a. naeslundii type 2 fimbrial antibody, but the subunit protein was detected in extracts of the orf365 mutant. the subunit protein detected in this mutant also was immunostained by an  antibody raised against a synthetic peptide representing the c-terminal 20 amino  acid residues of the predicted fima. the antipeptide antibody reacted with fima isolated from the recombinant escherichia coli clone containing fima but did not  react with purified type 2 fimbriae in extracts of the wild-type strain. these results indicate that synthesis of type 2 fimbriae in a. naeslundii t14v may involve posttranslational cleavage of both the n-terminal and c-terminal peptides of the precursor subunit and also the expression of orf365.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == microbiota of health, gingivitis, and initial periodontitis.
AB  == this study compared the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health, gingivitis  and initial periodontitis using predominant culture and a dna probe, checkerboard hybridization method. 56 healthy adult subjects with minimal periodontal attachment loss were clinically monitored at 3-month intervals for 12 months. more sites demonstrated small increments of attachment loss than attachment gain  over the monitoring period. sites, from 17 subjects, showing > or = 1.5 mm periodontal attachment loss during monitoring were sampled as active lesions for  microbial analysis. twelve subjects demonstrated interproximal lesions, and 5 subjects had attachment loss at buccal sites (recession). cultural studies identified bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and selenomonas noxia as  the predominant species associated with active interproximal lesions (9 subjects), whereas actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis, were the dominant species colonizing buccal active sites. a. naeslundii, campylobacter gracilis, and b. forsythus (at lower levels than active sites) were the dominant  species cultured from gingivitis (10 subjects). health-associated species (10 subjects) included streptococcus oralis, a. naeslundii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. dna probe data identified higher mean levels of b. forsythus and c. rectus with active (7 subjects) compared to inactive periodontitis sites. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were detected infrequently. cluster analysis of the cultural microbiota grouped 8/9 active interproximal lesions in one subcluster characterized by a mostly gram-negative microbiota, including b. forsythus and c. rectus. the data suggest that b. forsythus c. rectus and s. noxia were major species characterizing sites converting from periodontal health to disease. the differences in location and microbiota of interproximal and buccal active sites suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in increased attachment loss.

TI  == investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  == dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. the two major calcium-binding sites on gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (cwm) from streptococcus mutans r9, strep. oralis ef186, strep. gordonii nctc 7865, strep. downei nctc 11391, actinomyces naeslundii wvu627 and lactobacillus casei ac413. this material was stripped of phosphate (ps-cwm) and treated to mask carboxylate  groups (cm-cwm). whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (strep. downei) to 50 (l. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). differences in cwm, ps-cwm and cm-cwm calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. these data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing strep. oralis. in the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.

TI  == structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  == lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. the presence of two host-like motifs, either galnac beta1-->3gal (gn) or gal beta1-->3galnac (g), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with  actinomyces naeslundii. three streptococcal strains which have gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in galnac-sensitive coaggregations with strains  of streptococcus gordonii and s. sanguis. each gn- or g-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. the occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations  with actinomyces was examined. negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a gal and galnac binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known gn- or g-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related  gn-containing type. unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most  rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. gn-containing polysaccharides occurred  primarily on the strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis while g-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of s. gordonii and s. mitis examined. the findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse gn- and g-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to an immobilized antimicrobial agent.
AB  == an antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. interaction between the material (termed) oais) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. seven species of streptococcus and two actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to oais revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. the results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to oais. gel electrophoresis revealed that oais could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the strep. mutans strain to oais in a dose-dependent manner. the results indicate that oais adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. a major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

TI  == effect of antibodies on the chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  == passive immunization has been suggested as a method to prevent colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. however, the mechanism of action of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, is not clear. in this study we investigated the effect of polyclonal antibodies (pabs) and a monoclonal antibody (omvu10) on the  chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus. during growth in broth s. sobrinus formed significantly longer chains in the presence of pabs in comparison to pre-immune serum (p < 0.01), but pabs did not influence the growth rate of s.  sobrinus in broth. omvu10 did not influence the growth rate nor the chain length. in order to study the effect of the antibodies on adhesion and growth on a surface, s. sobrinus was grown on hydroxyapatite discs in the presence of two other bacteria, streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus. no effect of the antibodies was found on the total cultivable count of the three bacteria after growth on hydroxyapatite discs. however, the morphology of the s. sobrinus microcolonies was different after growth in the presence of both pabs and omvu10. the colonies were less dense and chains of s. sobrinus could be seen using a confocal laser microscope. after growth in the presence of the control antibodies, the colonies were dense and no long chains could be observed. it was  concluded that pabs influenced the chain length, in broth and on hydroxyapatite discs, and the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs, whereas  omvu10 influenced the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs.

TI  == cell surface polypeptide csha mediates binding of streptococcus gordonii to other oral bacteria and to immobilized fibronectin.
AB  == isogenic mutants of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) in which the genes encoding high-molecular-mass cell surface polypeptides csha and/or cshb were inactivated were deficient in binding to four strains of actinomyces naeslundii and two strains of streptococcus oralis. lactose-sensitive interactions of s. gordonii with a. naeslundii atcc 12104 and pk606 were associated with expression  of csha but not of cshb. lactose-insensitive interactions of s. gordonii with a.  naeslundii t14v and wvu627, and with s. oralis c104 and 34, were dependent on expression of csha and cshb. s. gordonii dl1 cells bound to immobilized human fibronectin (fn), but not to soluble fn, in a dose-dependent manner, and binding  was noninhibitable by heparin. s. gordonii csha and cshb mutants were also deficient in binding to immobilized human fn. antibodies to an nh2-terminal nonrepetitive region (amino acid residues 42 to 886) of recombinant csha inhibited binding of s. gordonii dl1 cells to a. naeslundii t14v and pk606 and to immobilized fn. conversely, antibodies to an amino acid repeat block segment of the cooh-terminal domain (amino acid residues 2026 to 2508) were not inhibitory to adherence. assays using csha-specific antibodies revealed that surface expression of csha was reduced in cshb mutants. the results suggest that csha acts as a multifunctional adhesin in s. gordonii and that major adhesion-mediating sequences are specified within the nonrepetitive nh2-terminal  region of the polypeptide.

TI  == influence of ionic strength and substratum hydrophobicity on the co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs.
AB  == co-adhesion between oral microbial pairs (i.e. adhesion of a planktonic microorganism to a sessile organism adhering to a substratum surface) has been described as a highly specific interaction, mediated by stereochemical groups on  the interacting microbial cell surfaces, and also as a non-specific, critical colloid-chemical interaction. in a colloid-chemical approach, microbial co-adhesion is considered as an interplay between, amongst others, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of ionic strength on the co-adhesion of streptococcus oralis 34 to either actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 or its mutant strain 5951 adhering to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. to this end, the ionic strength of the suspension was varied by the addition of kcl. another aim was to investigate whether substratum hydrophobicity affected the co-adhesion between the organisms  by allowing the sessile organisms (in this case the actinomyces) to adhere either to hydrophilic or to hydrophobic, dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass. the  kinetics of co-adhesion of s. oralis 34 to the actinomyces decreased with increasing ionic strength, expressed as the ratio, chi, between the local and non-local initial deposition rates of the streptococci in the vicinity of, or far away from, the adhering actinomyces, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, ionic strength appeared not to be a determinant factor for the co-adhesion of s. oralis 34 with a. naeslundii 5951, either when the actinomyces  were adhering to hydrophilic glass or to hydrophobic, dds-coated glass. however,  for s. oralis 34 co-adhering in a stationary end-point with a. naeslundii t14v-j1 in the high-ionic-strength (250 mm kcl) suspension, co-adhesion was far less on hydrophobic, dds-coated glass than on hydrophilic glass. it is possible that the  hydrophobic fibrils on a. naeslundii t14v-j1 bearing the lectin responsible for co-adhesion were immobilized in the latter case by adsorption to the hydrophobic  substratum, making them less available for interaction with the streptococci.

TI  == influence of temperature on the co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs in saliva.
AB  == coaggregation (interactions between two planktonic microorganisms) and co-adhesion (interactions between sessile and planktonic microorganisms) are believed to be important factors in the formation of dental plaque by many investigators, although others doubt whether coaggregation and co-adhesion occur  in vivo. it is known that coaggregation and co-adhesion generally occur equally well in buffer as in saliva, but the influence of temperature on the co-adhesion  of coaggregating oral microbial pairs in saliva is unknown. therefore, co-adhesion of streptococci suspended in saliva to glass with adhering actinomyces present (1.0 x 10(6) cells cm-2) was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber in the temperature range from 22 degrees c to 40 degrees c. in the range  from 22 degrees c up to 35 degrees c both pairs studied, streptococcus oralis 34  with actinomyces naeslundii 5951 and streptococcus oralis j22 with a. naeslundii  5951, displayed similar co-adhesion kinetics and co-adhesion in a stationary end-point, but around and above 37 degrees c co-adhesion almost disappeared. hence, we conclude that co-adhesion of coaggregating oral microbial pairs in saliva may be critically influenced by temperature, especially around the temperatures prevailing in the oral cavity.

AB  == purpose: to evaluate the shear bond strength (sbs) and microleakage (ml) to dentin as well as the antimicrobial action against five strains of oral bacteria  of aelitebond single primer restorative system. materials and methods: fifteen molars were tested to failure for each of the four time periods: 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days, after final cure. the test specimens were prepared on  the dentin surfaces of the extracted molars ground on 600 grit sic paper. the bonded cylinders were removed from the assembly apparatus after cure, stored in physiological saline at 37 degrees c for the four different time periods and subjected to a shear bond load at 0.5 mm/minute until fractured. for the microleakage determination, class v cavity preparations were done on the facial surfaces of the roots of 15 canines below the cemento-enamel junction and the specimens thermocycled (500x) between 8 degrees c and 15 degrees c in 2% methylene blue. the teeth were cut into 6 mm thick sections and the sections which included the restorations were separately dissolved in acid. the color intensities of the dissolved sections were measured at a wavelength of 590 nm against a standard curve which was constructed from the dye. the modified model cavity method of meryon & johnson (1989) was used to assess the antimicrobial properties of the restorative system. results: the mean sbs values (in mpa) were  found to be 10.3, 9.8, 11.47 and 9.9 after 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. there was no significant increase (p < 5%) in the sbs after 15 minutes. the ml of 0.76 micrograms dye/ restoration was relatively low in comparison to the sbs values. the restorative system significantly (p < 5%) inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii with 88%, streptococcus mutans with 42%, streptococcus sanguis with 39% and streptococcus oralis with 9%. however, the growth of veillonella parvula was stimulated with 49%.

AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

AB  == co-aggregation (interactions between two suspended micro-organisms) between oral  microbial pairs has been studied extensively and is believed to be an important factor in dental plaque formation. however, co-adhesion (interactions between suspended and already-adhering micro-organisms) may well be equally important. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of saliva and lactose on the co-adhesion of streptococci (s. oralis 34 and s. sanguis pk1889) to actinomyces (a. naeslundii t14v-j1 or 5951) adhering on glass under flow from buffer and saliva in the absence and presence of lactose. the kinetics of co-adhesion as well as co-adhesion in a stationary end-point of co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber by analysis of the spatial arrangement of co-adhering micro-organisms as a function of time.  for co-aggregating pairs, initial deposition rates of streptococci in the immediate vicinity of adhering actinomyces (local initial deposition rates) were  up to 5 to 10 times higher than the non-local initial deposition rates in buffer  and in saliva, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, 5 to 6 times more streptococci co-adhered with the adhering actinomyces than averaged over the entire substratum surface. a non-co-aggregating pair showed only minor preferential (co-)adhesion near the adhering actinomyces. co-adhesion in buffer was fully lost when lactose was added. however, addition of lactose to saliva did not inhibit co-adhesion, but co-adhesion became more reversible. detachment of micro-organisms from the substratum due to the passage of an air-liquid interface, as occurs in the oral cavity during eating, drinking, and speaking, was minimal when deposition was carried out from buffer to bare glass. major detachment of streptococci adhering to the substratum occurred when adhesion was  mediated through a salivary conditioning film on the glass, while detachment of adhering actinomyces and streptococci co-adhering with them remained low. it is suggested that, in the development of dental plaque, adhering actinomyces may act as strongholds for other micro-organisms, like streptococci, to adhere.

TI  == isolation and characterization of coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis).
AB  == streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) bears coaggregation-mediating surface adhesins which recognize galactoside-containing surface polysaccharides on streptococcus oralis 34, streptococcus oralis c104, and streptococcus sm pk509. fifty-nine spontaneously-occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of s. gordonii dl1 unable to coaggregate with partner streptococci were isolated. six representative cog- mutants were characterized by their coaggregation properties  with four actinomyces naeslundii strains (t14v, pk947, pk606, pk984), veillonella atypica pk1910, and propionibacterium acnes pk93. the six representative cog- mutants showed altered coaggregation with their streptococcal partners, a. naeslundii pk947, and p. acnes pk93. based on the coaggregation phenotypes of these mutants, a model for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation between s. gordonii dl1 and its partner bacteria is proposed. the potential use of these mutants in studies of oral biofilms is discussed.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == detection and incidence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in the  microflora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene  tet(m). both pcr amplification and dna hybridization, using a fragment of tet(m)  from tn1545, were used to detect tet(m). the pcr primers (5'-gacacgccaggacatatgg-3' and 5'-tgctttcctcttgttcgag-3') were chosen to amplify  a 397 bp region of tet(m). tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. the percentage of tet(m)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83%  (mean of 10%). tet(m) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. the tet(m) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly s. intermedius, s. oralis, s. sanguis, and streptococcus sm4), actinomyces d01 (14%), bifidobacterium d05 (11%), and veillonella spp. (10%). tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(m) was not detected included the prevotella and bacteroides species (41%, mainly bacteroides d28, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. oris). these results suggest that tet(m) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of s. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not  considered to be periodontopathogens. assessment of other tetracycline-resistant  genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.

TI  == a comparison of the microbial flora in carious dentine of clinically detectable and undetectable occlusal lesions.
AB  == it is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (hcl) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (svl). previous studies of the microflora of hcl suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. the aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 hcl and 17 svl in a population of children aged 8-18 years. the following bacteria were identified: actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii. streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus spp. streptococcus mutans was found more often in the hcl group (p  = 0.03), while streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the svl group (p =  0.05). however, proportions of both species were lower in the svl group as compared with the hcl group (s. mutans p = 0.07; s. sobrinus p = 0.03). lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. a  more diverse range of streptococcal species and veillonella was found in the svl  group (p = 0.001). these results show a less complex microflora in hcl as compared with svl, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  == kinetics of lactose-reversible coadhesion of actinomyces naeslundii wvu 398a and  streptococcus oralis 34 on the surface of hexadecane droplets.
AB  == most investigations of mechanisms accounting for intergeneric coaggregation have  emphasized stereospecific rather than nonspecific interactions. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative importance of lectin-carbohydrate and nonspecific hydrophobic and ionic interactions, using a model based on strains with one of the most well understood specific coaggregation mechanisms, the lactose-reversible coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. the kinetics of coadhesion and desorption of coadherent bacteria were studied using s. oralis 34 bound to hexadecane droplets  as an affinity support for the adhesion of a. naeslundii wvu 398a. light, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that a. naeslundii cells adhered only to the s. oralis cells, not to exposed hexadecane between the streptococci. coadhesion was inhibited by lactose concentrations as low as 2.0 mm. the rate of coadhesion was halved at 60 mm lactose. the hydrophobicity inhibitors bovine serum albumin and defatted bovine serum albumin  and the salts licl and kcl failed to inhibit coadhesion in the hexadecane assay,  and bovine serum albumin also failed to inhibit coaggregation in a bacterial aggregation assay on glass slides. high concentrations of the salts achieved a 50% rate decrease in a. naeslundii adhesion to the s. oralis-coated droplets only when they were combined with > 20 mm lactose. sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) and tween 20 inhibition was tested by the slide coaggregation assay because they tended to emulsify the droplets; sds was inhibitory. lactose selectively desorbed a. naeslundii from s. oralis-coated droplets at low concentrations equivalent to  those that inhibited coadhesion. neither licl nor kcl desorbed a. naeslundii from the droplets, even at 500 mm. at low concentrations, sds but not tween 20 eluted  both a. naeslundii and s. oralis from the droplets. although the sds results might suggest a degree of cooperative charge interactions, the results support the hypothesis that stereospecific, beta-galactoside-sensitive interactions have  a much greater impact than nonspecific interactions on the coadhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus gordonii 38: structure and immunochemical comparison with the receptor polysaccharides of streptococcus oralis 34 and streptococcus mitis j22.
AB  == as part of our ongoing investigations involving lectin-mediated adhesion among oral bacteria, the receptor polysaccharide from streptococcus gordonii 38 was isolated and characterized. carbohydrate analysis of the hydrolysed s. gordonii 38 polysaccharide by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (hpaec-pad) showed galactose (gal) (2 mol), n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac) (1 mol), rhamnose (rha) (2 mol), glucose (glc) (1  mol) and galactosamine-6-phosphate (1 mol). mild acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide yielded a heptasaccharide repeating unit. the structure of the heptasaccharide repeating unit was determined by high-resolution nmr spectroscopy which includes various homonuclear (dqf-cosy, tqf-cosy, noesy and hohaha) and heteronuclear experiments (hmqc), including linkage assignments by 1h-13c long-range correlation (hmbc). complete 1h and 13c nmr assignments for the intact polysaccharide yielded the covalent structure of a heptasaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text] the structure of the strain 38 polysaccharide is closely related to those of streptococcus mitis j22 and streptococcus oralis 34.  thus, the difference between the strain 38 and j22 heptasaccharides was at their  reducing ends, with galnac beta-(1-->3)-gal in the former and gal beta-(1-->3)-galnac in the latter, while the difference between the 38 heptasaccharide and 34 hexasaccharide was at the non-reducing ends, where a rhamnose branch occurred in the former but not the latter structure. when compared by their quantitative precipitin curves with rabbit antibodies against each streptococcal strain, the strain 38 polysaccharide reacted more like the polysaccharide of strain j22 than that of strain 34. in contrast, each strain was recognized by the gal- and galnac-reactive lectins of actinomyces spp., but only  strains 38 and 34 were recognized by galnac-sensitive lectins of other streptococci. these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the immunogenic features of these polysaccharides are distinct from those detected by lectin binding.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  == the treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. to investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. analyses of  sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that s. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. the pattern of recolonization by individual streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: s. oralis and s. sanguis were primary colonizers while s. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. it is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == the resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == coaggregations between bacterial species have been widely studied in vitro but not in the mouth. a new in vivo assay was used to measure the rate and composition of indigenous plaque formation onto bovine enamel chips covered with  a continuous layer of bacteria. chips were covered with streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, which coaggregated with many oral species, or streptococcus gordonii s7, which did not coaggregate with these oral species, and placed in the mouth for 4  and 24 h. there were no differences in the number of most indigenous bacterial species isolated from the two streptococcal surfaces. however, the number of actinomyces viscosus as a proportion of total actinomyces spp. was significantly  different on the two surfaces at 24 h. with the exception of actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus removed from the s7 surface, all indigenous species increased significantly in number from 4 to 24 h, irrespective of the streptococcal surface. this study demonstrated that interbacterial coaggregation  had only a limited effect on in vivo plaque development. thus suggesting that environmental factors, growth or other adherence phenomena are dominant in in vivo plaque formation.

AB  == in 15 caries-active patients, with a total of 770 exposed root surfaces, the effect of fluoride therapy and professional tooth cleaning was studied during a 1-year period. dental plaque from 92 of the root surfaces and whole saliva samples were analysed at baseline and after 12 months for the presence of specific bacteria. the results showed that the number of active carious lesions had decreased from 99 to 46, while the inactive lesions had increased from 69 to  124. of the active lesions which had been converted into inactive lesions, most were on the buccal and fewest were located on the distal surfaces. lower plaque scores were found on sound and inactive root surfaces compared to active surfaces. the salivary concentrations of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli remained constant during the 12-month observation period. there was a tendency for higher levels of streptococcus mutans in plaque from active lesions compared  with sound root surfaces, whereas an inverse relationship was noted for the streptococcus oralis group. no significant differences in the actinomyces naeslundii counts were detected. in conclusion, the 12-month prophylactic programme had an effect on the clinical surface characteristics of root caries, but the components of the oral microflora selected for study seemed to be relatively unaffected during the observation period.

TI  == actinomyces tissue specificity may depend on differences in receptor specificity  for galnac beta-containing glycoconjugates.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii 12104 and a. viscosus ly7 were compared for receptor specificities and adherence properties because these relate to their oral colonization sites. both strains bind galnac beta-containing glycosphingolipids (gsls) in a galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl-sensitive fashion but differ with respect to the number of cells bound to gsls and the effect of neighboring sugar  groups on the binding. their hemagglutination and saccharide inhibition profiles  confirms the existence of two receptor specificities (for example, when galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl is multivalently conjugated to albumin, its inhibitory activity increases fourfold toward strain 12104 but decreases fourfold toward strain ly7). trypsin or chymotrypsin treatment of human erythrocytes, which possess receptor gsls, improves their hemagglutination with strain 12104. in contrast, the same treatment of chicken erythrocytes, which lack receptor gsls, abolishes their hemagglutination. these findings suggest that both gsls and glycoproteins act as functional receptors on eukaryotic cells. the strains also differ with respect to the following galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl-sensitive adherence properties: (i) strain ly7 adheres somewhat better than does strain 12104 to buccal epithelial cells; (ii) in spite of their similar overall coaggregation patterns with streptococci, strain 12104 coaggregates with streptococcus oralis mpb1 but strain ly7 does not; (iii) strain 12104 alone shows galnac beta-sensitive saliva aggregation and adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the gsl binding patterns of fresh actinomyces isolates reveal a high prevalence of ly7-like specificities among buccal isolates, whereas 12104-like specificities are most prevalent among plaque isolates. these findings strongly suggest that fresh actinomyces isolates use fine specificity for galnac  beta-containing glycoconjugates in recognition and subsequent colonization of specific oral surfaces.

TI  == complete structure of the cell surface polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis c104: a 600-mhz nmr study.

TI  == complete structure of the cell surface polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557: a receptor for lectin-mediated interbacterial adherence.
AB  == lectin-carbohydrate binding is known to play an important role in a number of different cell-cell interactions including those between certain species of oral  streptococci and actinomyces that colonize teeth. the cell wall polysaccharides of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, s. oralis 34, and streptococcus mitis j22, although not identical antigenically, each function as a receptor molecule for the galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine reactive fimbrial lectins of actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. carbohydrate analysis of the receptor polysaccharide isolated from s. oralis atcc 10557 shows galactose (3 mol), glucose (1 mol), galnac (1 mol), and rhamnose (1 mol). 1h nmr spectra of the polysaccharide show that is is partially o-acetylated. analysis of the 1h nmr spectrum of the de-o-acetylated polysaccharide shows that it is composed of repeating subunits containing six monosaccharides and that the subunits are joined by a phosphodiester linkage. the 1h and 13c nmr spectra were completely assigned by two-dimensional homonuclear correlation methods and by 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (1h[13c]hmqc). the linkage of the component monosaccharides in the polymer, deduced from two-dimensional 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectra (1h[13c]hmbc), shows  that the repeating unit of the de-o-acetylated polymer is a linear hexasaccharide with no branch points. the complete 1h and 13c assignment of the native polysaccharide was carried out by the same techniques augmented by a 13c-coupled  hybrid hmqc-cosy method, which is shown to be especially useful for carbohydrates in which strong coupling and overlapping peaks in the 1h spectrum pose difficulties. the fully assigned spectra of the native polymer show that each of  two different positions is acetylated in one-third of the repeating subunits and  that the acetylation is randomly distributed along the polymer. the exact positions of acetylation were assigned by a carbonyl-selective hmbc method that unambiguously defines the positions of o-acetylation. the complete structure of the native polysaccharide in s. oralis atcc 10557 is [formula: see text] comparison of this structure with those previously determined for the polysaccharides of strains 34 and j22 suggests that the similar lectin receptor activities of these molecules may depend on internal galactofuranose linked (beta 1----6)- to gal(beta 1----3)galnac(alpha) or galnac(beta 1----3)gal(alpha).

AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == effect of nutrients on defined bacterial plaques and streptococcus mutans c67-1 implantation in a model mouth.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, streptococcus oralis lpa-1 and veillonella dispar omz 193 were cocultured on teeth in a model mouth for 66 h. synthetic saliva containing bovine salivary glycoprotein supported bacterial growth, although the  delivery of an intermittent nutrient supplement, containing 1% (w/v) glucose or sucrose, gave greater bacterial cell and viable counts. when streptococcus mutans c67-1 was super-inoculated onto 24-hour mixed plaques, it became established under all regimens, but there was pronounced colonization resistance. with saliva only, the proportion of s. mutans at 66 h was less than 0.5% of the total cultivable microflora. when a glucose supplement was delivered for 1 h every 6 h, s. mutans attained a final proportion of 2.4%. with sucrose, both s. mutans c67-1 and its non-cariogenic glucan-deficient mutant, c67-25, attained similar proportions of 15-20%. these experiments indicate how this model can be used to study the factors influencing colonizing ability and microbial interactions in biofilms under controlled conditions.

TI  == association of selected bacteria with the lesions of root surface caries.
AB  == plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. five subject groups were defined: a (dmfs 16.4), b (dmfs 55.9), c1 (dmfs 55.6), c2 (dmfs 57.0) and c3 (dmfs 48.1). groups c1 and c2 had unrestored root surface lesions; group a, b and c3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in groups c1 and c2 than from intact root surfaces in group a. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis 1 and streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from group a. the percentage contribution that s. mutans made to plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 was higher than that from plaque  in group a and actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in group c1 than in samples from group a. the percentage counts of lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 were higher than those from intact roots in groups a, b, and c3. subjects were also grouped on the presence of lactobacillus  and s. mutans in plaque samples. samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of s. mitis 1 and  also a. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing s. mutans or lactobacillus. actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples  containing both s. mutans and lactobacillus. the results confirm an association of s. mutans and lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and a. viscosus serovar 2.

TI  == aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.
AB  == seventeen strains of oral bacteria of the genera actinomyces (5), bacteroides (3), and streptococcus (9) were tested for aggregation by the human whole salivary mucin fraction (hwsm) in comparison to three types of animal mucin preparations from submandibular glands of cow (bsm) and sheep (osm), and from the stomach of pig (pgm). considerable variation was seen with respect to the rate and titer of aggregation induced by these mucins. the aggregating activity of hwsm varied widely among the different bacterial strains. the bacteroides group showed hardly any induced aggregation, whereas the final aggregation titers varied for s. sanguis (3 strains) between 12 and 48, for s. oralis (3 strains) between 6 and 48, for the s. mutans group (3 strains) between 6 and 96, and for the five actinomyces strains even between 6 and 192. for a particular strain, similar differences in titer were seen between the four mucins. for a human salivary mucin (mg-2) it has been described that sialic acid in the sequence neuac (alpha 2,3)gal(beta 1,3)galnac- was specifically involved in the interaction with s. sanguis strains, in contrast to s. rattus bht. our results, however, indicate that this sugar sequence is not a prerequisite for the aggregation of s. sanguis, as animal mucins, devoid of this structure, were equally well or even better capable of inducing aggregation. on the other hand, desialization of bsm and osm largely abolished their aggregating capability towards s. rattus bht. moreover, it was found that bsm and osm, which are comparable with respect to their major oligosaccharide structure, show considerable differences in aggregating activity towards the same bacterial strain.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == ischaemic mouse thigh model for evaluation of pathogenicity of non-clostridial anaerobes.
AB  == a mouse thigh model has been devised in which the growing culture of non-clostridial anaerobe in the ischaemic tissue produces inflammatory swelling and death. the swelling of the right thigh served as an index of pathogenicity of the test strain in comparison to the negatively reacting left thigh which received injection of the control strain of bifidobacterium infantis. actinomyces naeslundii exceptionally caused death in all animals within 24 h. mortality and thigh swelling were pronounced (greater than 75%) in case of fusobacterium gonidiaformans and propionibacterium acnes but less (less than 50%) in acidaminococcus fermentans. high (less than 75%) rate of thigh swelling was also  encountered in case of bacteroides oralis, bacteroides corrodens, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium plauti, peptococcus prevotii, streptococcus intermedius, eubacterium lentum and propionibacterium freudenreichii ss. shermanii.

TI  == surface structures, co-aggregation and adherence phenomena of streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == seven strains of streptococcus oralis were found to possess surface structures. four strains possessed long fimbriae which ranged in length from 266-366 nm, while the remaining three strains possessed shorter peritrichously distributed fibrils which ranged in length from 80-197 nm. the fibrillar strains were morphologically similar to strains of streptococcus sanguis i and ii and streptococcus mitis. no strain of s. oralis produced tufts of fibrils like certain strains of s. sanguis i. strains of streptococcus milleri produced peritrichously distributed fimbriae which were morphologically dissimilar to the  fimbriae produced by s. oralis strains. s. oralis strains were moderately to highly hydrophobic, but hydrophobicity could not be related to adhesion parameters or type or length or density of surface structures. furthermore, there appeared to be no correlation between type of surface structures and adhesion parameters. two of the three fibrillar strains of s. oralis and the peritrichously fibrillar strains of s. sanguis, together with one strain of s. milleri, were able to co-aggregate with actinomycetes.

TI  == microbiology of the early colonization of human enamel and root surfaces in vivo.
AB  == this study describes the predominant early microflora on human teeth on the basis of microbiologic identification of 1742 fresh isolates. the isolates were obtained from four dental students who carried test pieces of enamel and root surface in the oral cavity for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. during the experimental periods oral hygiene was discontinued. under equal conditions root surfaces were  more heavily colonized than were enamel surfaces. however, the composition of the microbiota was the same. within the first 24 h the microflora was dominated by streptococci and gram-positive pleomorphic rods. s. sanguis contributed only 6-18% of the early colonizers whereas s. mitis and s. oralis varied between 24-42% and 1-27% (mean values), respectively. the relative proportion of s. oralis increased significantly within the observation period while the proportion of s. salivarius and arginine-positive s. mitis showed a declining tendency. actinomyces species adsorbed to the tooth surfaces within the first 4 h but did not increase their relative proportions until after 8-12 h, possibly due to a long doubling time. in one individual, encapsulated bacteria resembling stomatococcus mucilaginosus were observed among the early colonizers. the time-dependent shifts in the bacterial populations within 24 h corroborate parallel ultrastructural findings.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  == experimental infections in root canals with streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (strep-mc4). actinomyces bovis (act-mc6) and bacteroides oralis (bact-mc3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. the immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. the antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. in 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. after 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and  histologically examined. the analyses revealed no significant difference between  the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher  in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. the cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. the radiographic and histologic examinations revealed  no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number  of teeth with periapical lesions. the radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. in the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.
