TI  - Profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. The aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four Streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. The amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using universal and species-specific primers, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). Among obligate anaerobes, Tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and Eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. By contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). Specifically, the proportion of T. forsythia, P. gingivalis or E. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of Streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. CONCLUSION: Obligate anaerobes, including T. forthysia, P. gingivalis and E. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas Streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. The proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.
TI  - Detection frequency of periodontitis-associated bacteria by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival and supragingival plaque of periodontitis and healthy subjects.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the detection frequencies of 25 bacterial species in subgingival and supragingival plaque of 18 untreated periodontitis subjects and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples, and bacterial detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction of the 16S rRNA genes. Fourteen bacteria showed no relationship with periodontitis, and 11 of these 14 species were frequently detected (> or =50%) in subgingival plaque in both periodontitis and healthy subjects. Nine bacteria such as Eubacterium saphenum, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola seemed to be related to periodontitis; their detection frequencies in subgingival plaque samples were higher in periodontitis than in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant by multiple comparisons (0.002< or =P<0.05). Two species (Mogibacterium timidum and Porphyromonas gingivalis) were detected significantly more frequently in subgingival plaque of periodontitis subjects than of healthy subjects (P<0.002), with P. gingivalis being detected only in periodontitis subjects, suggesting that these two species are closely related to periodontitis. There were no significant differences in the detection frequencies of the 25 bacteria between subgingival and supragingival plaque, suggesting that the bacterial flora of supragingival plaque reflects that of subgingival plaque.
TI  - New bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Recent investigations of the human subgingival oral flora based on ribosomal 16S  cloning and sequencing have shown many of the bacterial species present to be novel species or phylotypes. The purpose of the present investigation was to identify potential periodontal pathogens among these newly identified species and phylotypes. Species-specific ribosomal 16S primers for PCR amplification were developed for detection of new species. Associations with chronic periodontitis were observed for several new species or phylotypes, including uncultivated clones D084 and BH017 from the Deferribacteres phylum, AU126 from the Bacteroidetes phylum, Megasphaera clone BB166, clone X112 from the OP11 phylum, and clone I025 from the TM7 phylum, and the named species Eubacterium saphenum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, and Cryptobacterium curtum. Species or phylotypes more prevalent in periodontal health included two uncultivated phylotypes, clone W090 from the Deferribacteres phylum and clone BU063 from the Bacteroidetes, and named species Atopobium rimae and Atopobium parvulum.
TI  - Intraperitoneal immune cell responses to Eubacterium saphenum in mice.
AB  - Oral asaccharolytic Eubacterium saphenum, which are newly isolated gram-positive  rods and one of the predominant microorganisms in human periodontal pockets, were injected intraperitoneally in mice to elucidate their pathogenicity in periodontal diseases. Infiltrating immune cells in the peritoneal exudate were quantitated and intracellular T cell (CD4+/CD8+/gammadelta+) production of cytokines IL-4 and IFN-gamma which are related to cellular and humoral immunity, respectively, was determined. Neutrophils appeared first in peritoneal exudates, followed by macrophages and lymphocytes, after the injection of either E. saphenum or Porphyromonas gingivalis. Intracellular IL-4+ and IFN-gamma+ gammadelta T cells were detected in the exudates after the injection of E. saphenum (4.6 +/- 0.8% and 10.1 +/- 1.4%, respectively) and P. gingivalis (5.3 +/- 1.6% and 10.1 +/- 2.1%, respectively). The intracellular production of IL-4/IFN-gamma in CD4+/CD8+ T cells was rather low indicating that the main response was from gammadelta T cells which initiated the immune reactions in mouse peritoneal cavities after injection of E. saphenum or P. gingivalis. Serum IgG and IgM levels were elevated in animals injected with E. saphenum and similarly with P. gingivalis. The present study showed that with slight differences, similar modes of cell response and cytokine and Ig production were observed after intraperitoneal injection of both E. saphenum and P. gingivalis, indicating that E. saphenum may play just as important a role in periodontal diseases as P. gingivalis.
