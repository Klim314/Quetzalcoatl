TI  == moxifloxacin resistance is prevalent among bacteroides and prevotella species in  greece.
AB  == objectives: moxifloxacin is recommended in the empirical treatment of infections  involving gram-negative anaerobes. however, current european data regarding its activity against anaerobic pathogens are limited. in order to evaluate its potency, we comparatively studied the activity of moxifloxacin against recently isolated gram-negative anaerobes. methods: four hundred and ninety-five gram-negative anaerobic clinical isolates (296 bacteroides fragilis group, 58 non-fragilis bacteroides spp. and 141 prevotella spp.) were prospectively recovered in six greek hospitals. moxifloxacin mics were determined in comparison with those of penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, metronidazole and clindamycin. results: overall moxifloxacin mic(50) and mic(90)  were 2 and 32 mg/l, respectively. based on the current clsi breakpoints (susceptible, < or =2 mg/l; resistant, > or =8 mg/l), almost half of the total isolates (49%) were non-susceptible to moxifloxacin (32% resistant; 17% intermediate). this was more evident among the non-fragilis bacteroides species,  where 47% of the isolates were resistant and 14% intermediate to moxifloxacin. species variation was noticed, with the highest non-susceptible rates detected among prevotella oralis (90%), prevotella bivia (80%), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (75%), bacteroides uniformis (70%) and bacteroides capillosus (67%) species. among the 19 (4%) isolates that were metronidazole non-susceptible (mic > or = 16 mg/l), only 4 (21%) were additionally non-susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusions: high resistance rates to moxifloxacin among bacteroides and prevotella spp. were recorded, exceeding those previously reported in europe and contraindicating its use as monotherapy for infections involving gram-negative anaerobes without prior microbiological confirmation. for empirical usage, moxifloxacin should be combined with metronidazole in order to cover for these pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  == using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/ml against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against gram-positive organisms. all haemophilus and moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/ml of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all prevotella species [all except one strain of p. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/ml] and occasional strains of bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bilophila  wadsworthia, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella species. all fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == characterization of saccharolytic bacteroides and prevotella isolates from infected dog and cat bite wounds in humans.
AB  == saccharolytic, nonpigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from infected  dog and cat bite wounds in humans have been poorly characterized, and most are not included in the databases of kits used for anaerobic identification; thus, they are problematic for clinical laboratories to identify. fifty strains isolated from such wounds were characterized with commercial kits for preformed-enzyme detection, carbohydrate fermentation, and other biochemical tests. pcr fingerprinting was performed on these strains to further characterize  subgroups within these species. bacteroides tectum is a frequent isolate in bite  wounds and resembles prevotella bivia in colony morphology and saccharolytic activity, except that it grows in 20% bile and hydrolyzes esculin. profile numbers generated by various kits associate b. tectum with p. bivia, prevotella oralis group, or prevotella melaninogenica. pcr fingerprinting identified at least four subgroups and confirmed the heterogeneous nature of this species. prevotella heparinolytica was also frequently isolated from these bite wounds. it produces indole and generates a profile number in preformed-enzyme kits that is usually associated with bacteroides uniformis. however, it is bile sensitive and  quite distinct from the bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobes. the pcr fingerprint profiles generated by strains of p. heparinolytica were very similar  to that of the type strain and to each other. prevotella zoogleoformans, occasionally isolated from dog and cat bite wounds in humans, resembles p. heparinolytica except for a negative indole test. clinical laboratories should be aware of the characteristics of these animal species when identifying isolates from animal bite wounds in humans.
