TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == molecular methodology to assess the impact of cancer chemotherapy on the oral bacterial flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objective: this pilot study determined the profile of the oral bacterial flora in an outpatient cancer population before and after chemotherapy using molecular techniques. study design: we recruited 9 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients scheduled for induction chemotherapy. all were seen immediately before chemotherapy, and 7 to 14 days later. at both visits, we performed oral evaluations and obtained mucositis grading (with the world health organization [who] scale), absolute neutrophil counts (anc), and bacterial samples from the buccal mucosa. bacterial dna was isolated, and 16s ribosomal rna gene clonal libraries were constructed. sequences of genes in the library were used to determine species identity by comparison to known sequences. results: after chemotherapy, who scores of 0 and 1 were in 3 and 6 patients, respectively, and mean anc (+/-sd) dropped from 3326 +/- 463 to 1091 +/- 1082 cells/mm(3). from pre- and post-chemotherapy samples, 41 species were detected, with a predominance of gemella haemolysans and streptococcus mitis. more than 85% of species have not been previously identified in chemotherapy patients. seven species appeared exclusively before chemotherapy and 25 after chemotherapy. after chemotherapy, the number of species per patient increased by a mean of 2.6 (sd = 4.7, p = .052). conclusion: we identified species not previously identified in chemotherapy patients. our results suggest a shift to a more complex oral bacterial profile in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aphthous ulcers.
AB  == introduction: recurrent aphthous ulcers are common lesions of the oral mucosa of  which the etiology is unknown. this study aimed to estimate the bacterial diversity in the lesions and in control mucosa in pooled samples using a culture-independent molecular approach. methods: samples were collected from ten  healthy individuals and ten individuals with a clinical history of recurrent aphthous ulcers. after dna extraction, the 16s ribosomal rna bacterial gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with universal primers; amplicons were cloned, sequenced and matched to the genbank database. results: a total of 535 clones were analyzed, defining 95 bacterial species. we identified 62 putative novel phylotypes. in recurrent aphthous ulcer lesions 57 phylotypes were detected, of which 11 were known species. control samples had 38 phylotypes, five of which were already known. only three species or phylotypes were abundant and common to both groups (gemella haemolysans, streptococcus mitis strain 209 and streptococcus pneumoniae r6). one genus was found only in recurrent aphthous ulcer samples (prevotella) corresponding to 16% of all lesion-derived clones. conclusion: the microbiota found in recurrent aphthous ulcers and in the control  groups diverged markedly and the rich variety of genera found can provide a new starting point for individual qualitative and quantitative analyses of bacteria associated with this oral condition.

TI  == gemella bacteraemia characterised by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == aims: to define epidemiology, clinical disease, and outcome of gemella bacteraemia by 16s rrna gene sequencing. to examine the usefulness of the vitek,  api, and atb systems in identifying two gemella species. methods: all alpha haemolytic streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood cultures during a six year period were identified by conventional biochemical methods, the vitek system, and the api system. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed on all isolates identified by both kits as gemella with >or= 95% confidence or by either kit as any bacterial species with < 95% confidence. the atb expression system was used to identify the two isolates that were defined as  gemella species by 16s rrna gene sequencing. results: of the 302 alpha haemolytic streptococci other than s pneumoniae isolated, one was identified as gemella morbillorum, and another as gemella haemolysans by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the  patient with monomicrobial g morbillorum bacteraemia was a 66 year old man with community acquired infective endocarditis with septic thromboemboli. the patient  with g haemolysans bacteraemia was a 41 year old woman with hospital acquired polymicrobial bacteraemia during the neutropenic period of an autologous bone marrow transplant for non-hodgkin's lymphoma, the first case of its kind in the english literature. the api and atb expression systems only identified the second strain as g haemolysans at 94% and 99% confidence, respectively, whereas the vitek system identified none of the two strains correctly at > 70% confidence. conclusions: gemella bacteraemia is uncommon. 16s rrna gene sequencing is the method of choice for identification of gemella and gemella-like isolates.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-containing antigens in bacteria from the mouth and respiratory  tract.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (pc)-containing antigens were sought in 269 bacterial isolates  from the mouth and respiratory tract by an enzyme immunoassay method. only 41 (15%) isolates were pc-positive and of these 29 (70%) were strains of haemophilus influenzae. other species that produced positive results included two of five isolates of gemella haemolysans, two of five isolates of micrococcus spp., and a  single strain each of bacillus sp., corynebacterium jeikeium, lactococcus sp. and h. parainfluenzae. the presence of pc-containing antigens in h. influenzae may be an important source of cross-reaction in antigen detection techniques that detect the c-polysaccharide antigen of streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory specimens and would result in false positive results.

TI  == gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  == gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) cfu/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) cfu/ml for 75% of the samples. the 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), e. faecium (16), e. avium (7), e. durans (4), aerococcus viridans (10), streptococcus morbillorum (2), s. salivarius (1), s. sanguis (1), s. "milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.
