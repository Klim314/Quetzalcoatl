TI  - [Isolation and reassociation of acetogen and methanogen in a syntrophobic coculture degrading butyrate anaerobically].
AB  - Anaerobic coculture BF2 which degraded butyrate into acetate and produced methane was isolated from granular methanogenic sludge. The coculture is associated syntrophically the Syntrophomonas subsp. saponavida strain CF2 with Methanobacterium formicicum strain MF2 and appeared to degraded C4 approximately C18 fatty acids including isobutyrate. The optimal temperature and pH for growth was 37 degrees C and 7.7 respectively. The strain CF2 was obtained in pure culture with crotonate as substrate and produces acetate and butyrate. The doubling time of strain CF2 in crotonate media was about 20 hours. Strain CF2 is Gram negative, slightly curved 0.2 approximately 0.3 x 2.0 approximately 3.0 micron with round ends, motile by lateral flagellation at the concave side, non sporeforming. With a hydrogen scavenging organism, such as Methanospillum hungatei JF1, Methanobacterium formicicum 1535, Methanobrevibacterium bryantii 1125 and Desulfovibrio sp. B11, the strain CF2 paired up and the defined coculture degraded butyrate to acetate. When the strain CF2 associated with the original accompanist, Methanobacterium formicius strain MF2, the reassociated couculture degraded butyrate to acetate and produced methane again.
