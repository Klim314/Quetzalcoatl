TI  - The bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus depresses nodulation reactions to infection by inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis in tobacco hornworms, Manduca sexta.
AB  - The bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophilus, is a virulent insect pathogen. We tested the hypothesis that this bacterium impairs insect cellular immune defense reactions by inhibiting biosynthesis of eicosanoids involved in mediating cellular defense reactions. Fifth instar tobacco hornworms, Manduca sexta, produced melanized nodules in reaction to challenge with living and heat-killed X. nematophilus. However, the nodulation reactions were much attenuated in insects challenged with living bacteria (approximately 20 nodules/larva for living bacteria vs. approximately 80 nodules/larva in insects challenged with heat-killed bacteria). The nodule-inhibiting action of living X. nematophilus was due to a factor that was present in the organic, but not aqueous, fraction of the bacterial cultural medium. The nodule-inhibiting factor in the organic fraction was labile to heat treatments. The immunodepressive influence of the factor in the organic fraction was reversed by treating challenged hornworms with arachidonic acid. The factor also depressed nodulation reactions to challenge with the plant pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas putida and Ralstonia solanacearum. These findings indicate that one or more factors from X. nematophilus depress nodulation reactions in tobacco hornworms by inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and biosynthesis of indole antibiotics produced by Xenorhabdus nematophilus.
AB  - We have investigated the mechanism of action and physiology of production of the  indole derivative antibiotics produced by the nematode-associated, entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus. Maximum antibiotic concentration was reached during the late stationary phase of growth, and the antibiotic yield was appreciably enhanced by supplementation with tryptophan. Antibiotic biosynthesis apparently involved the removal of the side-chain carboxyl (C-1) carbon of tryptophan. The C-3 methylene carbon of tryptophan, on the other hand, was retained. The purified indole antibiotic was effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at low to moderate concentrations causing a severe inhibition of RNA synthesis, accompanied by a less severe effect on protein synthesis. An isogenic pair of Escherichia coli strains differing at the relA locus was used to demonstrate that the swift reduction in total RNA synthesis is related to an antibiotic-induced accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide, ppGpp, in susceptible bacteria. The E. coli relA mutant, which does not exhibit any discernible increase in ppGpp upon antibiotic treatment, showed no decrease in growth or RNA synthesis. Using this antibiotic, it was also observed that ppGpp may be employed as a metabolic regulator in bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida, which have not previously been reported to employ ppGpp as a regulatory molecule. We propose that the indole derivative antibiotic exerts growth inhibitory control in susceptible bacteria by greatly enhancing synthesis of ppGpp, resulting in a rapid inhibition of RNA synthesis.
