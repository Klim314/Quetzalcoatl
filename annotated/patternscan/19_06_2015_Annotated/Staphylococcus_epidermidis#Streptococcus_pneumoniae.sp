TI  == destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification  of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. however, before raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. in this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for raman spectroscopic identification. prior to the isolation, a  liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture pronase e is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. the extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with  6.107 to 6.104 cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus. the compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a classification of single-cell raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (pca) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (lda). these  classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. graphical abstract development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  == current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. in line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated  for their relative dna binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against gram-positive (including resistant mrsa, mrse, vre strains) and gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. the bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while  compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with mic of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of  staphyloccocus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of  sensitive and resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest dna binding affinity (deltatm of 15.4 degrees c). asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with dna, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial dna binding agents.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == false negative beta-2 transferrin in the diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leak in the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: the objectives of this study were to examine the presence  of beta-2 transferrin (beta2trnsf) in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) contaminated in vitro by various bacteria and explore the mechanism (passive or active) responsible for beta2trnsf elimination. early diagnosis of csf leakage may change treatment decisions and minimize the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. beta2trnsf is a protein present exclusively in csf. its detection is highly useful in cases of csf leakage, although it has never been examined in the presence of central nervous system infection. study design: prospective patient analysis. methods: sterile csf drawn from patients was contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms chosen for their ability to cause neurosurgical-related infections: streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. beta2trnsf was examined at two time points: following immediate inoculation (t0) and following an overnight incubation (t18) over various bacterial concentrations. samples of csf inoculated with s pneumoniae were also examined in the presence of ciprofloxacin. for beta2trnsf analysis we used immunoblotting electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: csf samples collected from nine patients were analyzed. beta2trnsf was not detected following s pneumoniae inoculation at both time points when immunoblotting electrophoresis was used. quantitative analysis using elisa demonstrated significant beta2trnsf concentration decrease. the addition of ciprofloxacin led to the same results. conclusions: csf leak detection using beta2trnsf may be deceiving in the presence of a s pneumoniae cerebral nervous system infection. a passive process is suggested, as beta2trnsf disappeared either immediately or following incubation with inactive bacteria.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == in this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (amps; pl-5, pl-31, pl-32, pl-18, pl-29 and pl-26), alone or in combination, against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis)  and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. in addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and pl-5  against staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. traditional antibiotics and amps showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. a strong synergistic effect in the pl-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. the mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of amps and traditional antibiotics. the combination of amps and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections,  particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == combination of pantothenamides with vanin inhibitors as a novel antibiotic strategy against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the emergence of resistance against current antibiotics calls for the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases. synthetic pantothenamides are pantothenate analogs that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro  in minimal media. pantothenamides were shown to be substrates of the bacterial coenzyme a (coa) biosynthetic pathway, causing cellular coa depletion and interference with fatty acid synthesis. in spite of their potential use and selectivity for bacterial metabolic routes, these compounds have never made it to the clinic. in the present study, we show that pantothenamides are not active as  antibiotics in the presence of serum, and we found that they were hydrolyzed by ubiquitous pantetheinases of the vanin family. to address this further, we synthesized a series of pantetheinase inhibitors based on a pantothenate scaffold that inhibited serum pantetheinase activity in the nanomolar range. mass spectrometric analysis showed that addition of these pantetheinase inhibitors prevented hydrolysis of pantothenamides by serum. we found that combinations of these novel pantetheinase inhibitors and prototypic pantothenamides like n5-pan and n7-pan exerted antimicrobial activity in vitro, particularly against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) even in the presence of serum. these results indicate that pantothenamides, when protected against degradation by host pantetheinases, are potentially useful antimicrobial agents.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == evaluation of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  == rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. we evaluated the accuracy of the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (nanosphere, inc., northbrook, il) for the identification of gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. the detection of resistance genes (meca in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and vana or vanb in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis) by the bc-gp assay also was assessed. a total of 186 positive blood cultures (in bact/alert fa bottles) with  gram-positive cocci observed with gram staining were analyzed using the bc-gp assay. the bc-gp results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat bc-gp testing. the initial bc-gp organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. only 40% of the streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. the detection of the meca  gene for 69 blood cultures with only s. aureus or s. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. for 3 of 6 cultures with multiple staphylococcus spp., meca detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than s. aureus or s. epidermidis. the detection of vana agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with e. faecalis or e. faecium. comparison of the mean times to results  for each organism group showed that bc-gp results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of td-1792, a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer antibiotic used against gram-positive bacteria, in a neutropenic murine thigh model.
AB  == td-1792 is a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer investigational antibiotic that displays potent bactericidal effects against clinically relevant  gram-positive organisms in vitro. the present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) of td-1792 in the neutropenic murine thigh infection animal model. td-1792, dosed subcutaneously (sc), produced dose-dependent reduction in the thigh bacterial burden of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis (mssa, mrsa, msse, mrse, respectively), penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), streptococcus  pyogenes, and vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (visa). in single-dose efficacy studies, the 1-log(10) cfu kill effective dose (ed(1-log  kill)) estimates for td-1792 ranged from 0.049 to 2.55 mg/kg of body weight administered sc, and the bacterial burden was reduced by up to 3 log(10) cfu/g from pretreatment values. against s. aureus atcc 33591 (mrsa), the total 24-h log(10) stasis dose (ed(stasis)) and ed(1-logkill) doses for td-1792 were 0.53 and 1.11 mg/kg/24 h, respectively, compared to 23.4 and 54.6 mg/kg/24 h for vancomycin, indicating that td-1762 is 44- to 49-fold more potent than vancomycin. pk-pd analysis of data from single-dose and dose-fractionation studies for mrsa (atcc 33591) demonstrated that the total-drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve-to-mic ratio (auc/mic ratio) was the best predictor  of efficacy (r(2) = 0.826) compared to total-drug maximum plasma concentration of drug-to-mic ratio (cmax/mic ratio; r(2) = 0.715) and percent time that the total-drug plasma drug concentration remains above the mic (%time>mic; r(2) = 0.749). the magnitudes of the total-drug auc/mic ratios associated with net bacterial stasis, a 1-log(10) cfu reduction from baseline and near maximal effect, were 21.1, 37.2, and 51.8, respectively. pk-pd targets based on such data represent useful inputs for analyses to support dose selection decisions for clinical studies of patients.

TI  == bacterial colonization or infection in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was the determination of bacteria present in maxillary and  ethmoid cavities in patients with chronic sinusitis and to correlate these findings with bacteria simultaneously present in their nasopharynx. the purpose of this correlation was to establish the role of bacteria found in chronically inflamed sinuses and to evaluate if the bacteria present colonized or infected sinus mucosa. nasopharyngeal and sinus swabs of 65 patients that underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery were cultivated and at the same time the presence of leukocytes were determined in each swab. the most frequently found bacteria in nasopharynx were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp., streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pneumoniae. maxillary or ethmoidal sinus swabs yielded bacterial growth in 47 (72.31%) patients. the most frequently found bacteria in sinuses were staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp. and streptococci (pneumoniae, viridans and spp.). the insignificant number of leukocytes was present in each sinus and nasopharyngeal swab. every published microbiology study of chronic sinusitis proved that sinus mucosa were colonized with bacteria and not infected, yet antibiotic therapy was discussed making no difference between infection and colonization. chronic sinusitis should be considered a chronic inflammatory condition rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotic therapy should be avoided. empiric antibiotic therapy should be prescribed only in cases when the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis occurs and the antibiotics prescribed should aim the usual bacteria causing acute sinusitis. in case of therapy failure, antibiotics should be changed having in mind that under certain circumstances any bacteria colonizing sinus mucosa can cause acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of mx-2401, an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide active in the presence of lung surfactant.
AB  == mx-2401 is an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic selective for gram-positive bacteria that is a semisynthetic analog of the naturally occurring  lipopeptide amphomycin. it was active against enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus (vse), vana-, vanb-, and vanc-positive vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), linezolid- and quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates (mic(90) of 4 mug/ml), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci, including  methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml), and streptococcus spp. including viridans group streptococci, and penicillin-resistant, penicillin-sensitive, penicillin-intermediate and macrolide-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) of 2 mug/ml). mx-2401 demonstrated a dose-dependent postantibiotic effect varying from 1.5 to 2.4 h. furthermore, mx-2401 was rapidly bactericidal at 4 times the mic against s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis, with more than 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial attained at 4 and 24 h, respectively. the mics of mx-2401 against mrsa, mssa, vse, and vre strains serially exposed for 15 passages to sub- to supra-mics of mx-2401 remained within three dilutions of the original mic. in contrast to that of the lipopeptide daptomycin, the antibacterial activity of mx-2401 was not affected in vitro by the presence of lung surfactant, and mx-2401 was active in vivo in the bronchial-alveolar pneumonia mouse model, in which daptomycin failed to show any  activity. moreover, the activity of mx-2401 was not as strongly dependent on the  ca(2+) concentration as is the activity of daptomycin. in conclusion, mx-2401 is  a promising new-generation lipopeptide for the treatment of serious infections with gram-positive bacteria, including hospital-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == expression of plectasin in pichia pastoris and its characterization as a new antimicrobial peptide against staphyloccocus and streptococcus.
AB  == recombinant plectasin, the first fungus defensin, was expressed in pichia pastoris and purified, and its physical, chemical and antimicrobial characteristics were studied. following a 120 h induction of recombinant yeast, the amount of total secreted protein reached 748.63 mug/ml. the percentage of recombinant plectasin was estimated to be 71.79% of the total protein. after purification with a sephadex g-25 column and rp-hplc, the identity of plectasin was verified by maldi-tof ms. plectasin exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria staphyloccocusaureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus suis. at a concentration of 2560 mug/ml, this peptide showed approximately equal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. suis, and s. pneumoniae, when compared to 320 mug/ml vancomycin, 640 mug/ml penicillin, 320 mug/ml vancomycin and 160 mug/ml vancomycin, respectively. in addition, plectasin showed anti-s. aureus activity over a wide ph range of 2.0 and 10.0, a high thermal stability at 100 degrees c for 1h and remarkable resistance to papain and pepsin. the expression and characterization of recombinant plectasin in p. pastoris has potential to treat streptococcus and staphyloccocus infections when most traditional antibiotics show no effect on them. our results indicate that plectasin can be produced in large quantities, and that it has pharmaceutical importance for the prevention and clinical treatment of staphyloccocus and streptococcus infections.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

AB  == background: our aims were to describe the aetiologies of culture-positive pleural infections and to evaluate the choice of empiric antimicrobial treatment regimens according to antimicrobial sensitivity, and to evaluate the possible influence of this on outcome. methods: all cases over a 9-y period were identified from 3 hospitals using the laboratory databases of the clinical microbiology departments, and were verified by evaluating the medical records. results: we identified 291 isolates in pleural fluid cultures from 158 patients. these included viridans streptococci (25%), staphylococcus aureus (18%), anaerobic bacteria (17%), enterobacteriaceae (12%), staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7%), with differences between nosocomial and community-acquired infections. the mortality (overall 27%) was highest among the  patients with enterobacteriaceae (50%) and s. aureus (36%) infections, and in patients with mixed infections (34%). the actual empiric treatment or the recommended penicillin plus metronidazole had low antimicrobial coverage (49%) compared to the proposed cefuroxime plus metronidazole (78%). thoracentesis was often delayed (median 2 days). the adequacy of empiric antimicrobial therapy was  independently correlated with mortality (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.62). conclusions: the early diagnosis of pleural infection could be optimized. in this north-european patient population, we suggest that the recommended empiric antimicrobial treatment be changed to cefuroxime plus metronidazole for community-acquired and nosocomial infections.

TI  == maxillary sinuses microbiology from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  == there isn't definitive and consistent data concerning the distribution of bacterial species in patients with chronic sinusitis (cs). the variability of the results from studies in cs may be due to the different techniques used as collection method, variations in culture methods, previous antibiotic use, and difficulty in distinguishing bacterial flora from pathogenic agents. study design: clinical prospective. aim: to identify the incidence of microorganisms in patients with crs by growing bacteria from the secretion of the maxillary sinus.  patients and methods: cross-sectional study in 62 patients that had undergone fess for treatment of chronic sinusitis; cultures from the maxillary sinus were obtained. results: 62 samples, 33 (53.2%) had no growth; 29 (45.2%) counts of aerobic bacteria; one case (1.6%) of fungus growth; we did not find anaerobic bacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the one more frequently found - 8 samples (27.6%), staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 samples each;  streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 samples (10.4%); other gram negative agents in 17 samples (31%). conclusion: in the present study we concluded that pseudomonas aeruginosa, other gram negatives bacteria and staphylococcus spp were the representatives of the bacterial flora found in the paranasal sinuses of patients with cs.

TI  == limitations of current antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.
AB  == bacterial conjunctivitis is a common ocular infection that is generally treated empirically with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. the more common pathogens causing bacterial conjunctivitis include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and moraxella species. several antibiotics traditionally used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis are no longer widely prescribed because of increased bacterial resistance and/or safety  concerns. the introduction of the fluoroquinolone class of anti-infectives offered effective and better tolerated treatment options. nonetheless, successful therapy for bacterial conjunctivitis continues to be limited by several factors.  a primary concern is the development of bacterial resistance that may be impacted not only by widespread antibiotic use but also by antibacterial pharmacokinetics, such as maintenance of insufficient bactericidal concentrations at the site of infection. in addition, poor adherence to prescribed regimens that require frequent administration, along with undesirable adverse events, affects the development of bacterial resistance and the success of treatment regimens. this article reviews current antibacterial agents used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, factors that limit their successful use in treatment, and options for future development of more effective topical ophthalmic anti-infective agents.

TI  == use of quantitative broad-based polymerase chain reaction for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == background: conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. objectives: the objective was to define the limit of detection (lod), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. methods: a pcr algorithm consisting of initial broad-based  detection of eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. the 16s rrna gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. pathogen-specific probes were designed for streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli,  and listeria monocytogenes. gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. the lod and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. a total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (csf) clinical samples obtained from the johns hopkins hospital (jhh) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. results: the lod of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. time to detection was 3 hours. in clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or gram-typing probes. adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% ci = 65.3% to 98.6%). the universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. conclusions: a broad-based multiprobe pcr assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise  in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [bacteriology of occluded nasolacrimal ducts in infants].
AB  == background: connatal lacrimal duct stenosis (cldo) commonly causes purulent bacterial dacyrocystitis. the recommended treatment of choice is up to the sixth  month of life a conservative antimicrobiological therapy. after the sixth month lacrimal duct irrigation with silicone tube intubation remains the gold standard. our purpose was to analyse the current bacterial spectrum in cldo and to compile  a bacterial resistogram in order to specify antimicrobiological therapy. methods: 66 samples from the lacrimal duct of 6- to 16-month-old children (41 female, 25 male) were obtained by collecting the refluxing liquids with cotton wool swabs after irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system with sterile saline during lacrimal duct surgery. cultures were incubated aerobically and anaerobically and  the infectious agents were isolated. sensitivity testing was performed for each isolate, testing 8 different commonly used local antibiotics. data were statistically analysed using spss. results: cultures were positive in cldo in 97  %, showing co-colonisation in 87 % with up to five bacterial strains. gram-positive bacteria were seen in 72 % of the isolates in cldo with streptococcus pneumoniae (31 %) being the most abundant strain, followed by staphylococcus aureus (13 %) and s. epidermidis (13 %). in 85 % of the samples at least one gram-negative rod was present, most often branhamella (12 %), followed  by haemophilus influenzae (11 %). sensitivity testing revealed chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin to be the most effective drugs in cldo, whereas erythromycin and gentamycin turned out to be insufficient in treating cldo. conclusion: bacterial colonisation plays a crucial role in cldo, showing a positive culture in 97 % with frequent co-colonisation of several bacterial strains (often in combination with at least one gram-negative strain).  the sampling of a microbiological probe of the lacrimal duct is recommended at least in therapy-refractory cases. current bacteria in cldo can be effectively treated with chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin. the commonly used antibiotics erythromycin and gentamicin are inappropriate as monotherapeutics.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == periorbital and orbital cellulitis: a 10-year review of hospitalized children.
AB  == purpose: periorbital cellulitis is often difficult to distinguish from orbital cellulitis, which is a potentially lethal infection involving the contents of the orbit. a delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment may result in serious complications. we studied the predisposing factors, microbiologic data, clinical  features, complications, and treatment of periorbital and orbital cellulitis in childhood. methods: eighty-three medical records of patients (mean age 3.7 +/- 3.1 years) admitted to the department of pediatrics with a diagnosis of periorbital or orbital cellulitis during the 10-year period january 1997 to december 2007 were retrospectively studied. results: in this series, periorbital  cellulitis occurred more frequently (83%) than orbital cellulitis (17%). of the children with periorbital cellulitis, 85% were younger than 5 years of age, while 62% of the children with orbital cellulitis were older than 5 years of age. the most common predisposing factors in periorbital cellulitis were upper respiratory infection (68%) and trauma to the eyelids (20%), while sinusitis was more frequently associated with orbital cellulitis (79%). blood and skin cultures were usually negative. the most common isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis. forty-five of the 83 children were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone + clindamycin (mean duration 8.6 +/- 5.5 days). intravenous antibiotics alone was an effective management in most of the patients, but a small proportion (6%) required surgical intervention. conclusions: upper respiratory infection and sinusitis are the most important predisposing factors for periocular infection. streptococcus species are the predominant causative agents. both diseases can usually be successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics, but some patients may require surgery to control extensive infection.

TI  == bactericidal activity of besifloxacin against staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == objectives: besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that was recently approved for topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. the compound was shown to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including isolates resistant to other antibacterials. here, the bactericidal activity of besifloxacin was evaluated against the most common bacterial conjunctivitis pathogens. methods: mic, mbc and time-kill experiments with besifloxacin and comparators were performed according to clsi guidelines. quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) were sequenced using standard pcr-based techniques. results: mic and mbc data indicated that besifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against staphylococcus aureus (n = 30), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 15) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 35), while  all fluoroquinolones were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (n = 40).  besifloxacin mbc:mic ratios were < or = 4 for 97.5% of all isolates tested (n = 120). all fluoroquinolones tested, as well as tobramycin, were bactericidal, while azithromycin was bactericidal against s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, but  bacteriostatic against the staphylococci. time-kill assays with all four species  showed that besifloxacin caused > or = 1000-fold killing within 2 h for 11 of 12  isolates. only one isolate treated with moxifloxacin and three ciprofloxacin-treated isolates achieved the same level of bactericidal activity under the same conditions. unlike the comparator fluoroquinolones, besifloxacin maintained a high potency and bactericidal activity even against strains that contained multiple mutations in the genes encoding dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. conclusions: overall, besifloxacin demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against the four major human pathogens tested here, including isolates that showed in vitro resistance to other fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, macrolides or aminoglycosides.

TI  == cem-101 activity against gram-positive organisms.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cem-101, a new fluoroketolide, was determined against gram-positive organisms with various macrolide susceptibility profiles. experiments for determination of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), timed killing, single-step and multistep mutation rates, the erythromycin induction of resistance, postantibiotic effect (pae), and drug interactions were  performed for cem-101; and the results were compared to those obtained with telithromycin, macrolides, and lincosamides. the mbcs of cem-101 remained lower overall than those of telithromycin, and cem-101 displayed a 2-fold greater potency than the ketolide. timed-killing curve testing showed that cem-101 had greater bactericidal activity than telithromycin (a >or=3-log(10)-cfu/ml decrease in the initial inoculum at 24 h) against the staphylococcal isolates tested. the  propensity of cem-101 to cause resistance was low, as determined from the rates of resistance determined in single-step mutational studies (<10(-8) or 10(-9)). in multipassaging studies, mutants of two strains (both of which were usa300 isolates) resistant to cem-101 emerged. that number was comparable to the number  resistant to clindamycin but less than the number resistant to telithromycin. erythromycin induced cem-101 resistance in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, similar to telithromycin; however, in seven of eight beta-hemolytic streptococci, cem-101 resistance induction was not observed. cem-101 showed a significant concentration- and exposure-dependent pae against the strains tested, with the values ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 h for gram-positive organisms (these times were longer than those for telithromycin). no antagonism was found in synergy analyses, with enhanced inhibition being most noted for combinations with cem-101 and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. overall, this new antimicrobial agent (cem-101) showed good antimicrobial characteristics compared with those of the agents in its class and exhibited measured parameter values similar or superior to those of utilized comparators, indicating that cem-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.

AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

TI  == linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (leader program for 2008).
AB  == the leader program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers. this report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. a total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 856), enterococci (901), streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. the nonsusceptible strains (22) were staphylococcus aureus (3), cons (14), and enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (g2576t in 19 strains; t2504a in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in leader 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. the mobile cfr resistance found in a staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility  levels). the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. however, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the s. epidermidis strain. the leader program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.

TI  == biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against mrsa and mrse.
AB  == silver bionanoparticles (agnps) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. this report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of staphylococcus aureus. the bioreduction  of the ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. the agnps were evaluated for their  antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. the most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant  s. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. from the clinical editor: silver bionanoparticles (agnps) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. the most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant s. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == ocular pharmacokinetics of besifloxacin following topical administration to rabbits, monkeys, and humans.
AB  == purpose: studies were conducted to evaluate the ocular penetration and systemic exposure to besifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, following topical ocular  administration to animals and humans. methods: besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension (0.6%) was administered as a topical ocular instillation to pigmented rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and human subjects. at predetermined intervals after dosing,  samples of ocular tissues and plasma were collected and analyzed for besifloxacin levels using hplc/ms/ms methods. results: besifloxacin demonstrated good ocular penetration in rabbits and monkeys, with rapid absorption and sustained concentrations observed in anterior ocular tissues through 24 h after a single administration. maximum besifloxacin concentrations in conjunctiva, cornea, and aqueous humor of monkeys were 6.43 microg/g, 2.10 microg/g, and 0.796 microg/ml,  respectively, after a single topical dose, and concentrations declined in these tissues with an apparent half-life of 5-14 h. following a single topical ocular administration to humans, the maximum besifloxacin concentration in tears was 610 microg/g with concentrations decreasing to approximately 1.6 microg/g at 24 h. the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters for besifloxacin in human tears were evaluated relative to the mic(90) values (microg/ml) for besifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae (0.125), staphylococcus aureus (0.25), staphylococcus epidermidis (0.5), and haemophilus influenzae (0.06). following a single topical  administration, the c(max)/mic(90) ratios for besifloxacin in human tears were >  or =1,220, and the auc((0-24))/mic(90) ratios were > or =2,500 for these relevant ocular pathogens. following repeated 3-times daily (tid) topical ocular administration to human subjects with clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis, maximum besifloxacin concentrations in plasma were less than 0.5  ng/ml, on average. conclusions: taken together, the results of the current investigation provide a pk/pd-based rationale that supports the use of besifloxacin for the safe and effective treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the indian scenario.
AB  == background: we studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. findings: a total of 115 (104 daily  wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were  the samples collected. the isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users  who used their lenses for less than 2 years. lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. the bacteria isolated were citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. conclusion: non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. the accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. the bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.

TI  == increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  == objectives: this study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. methods: opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. results: more opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (p < 0.05). opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. conclusions: the isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.

TI  == rate of bacterial eradication by ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  == introduction: antibacterial activity of ophthalmic fourth-generation fluoroquinolones has traditionally been evaluated by comparing only their active  ingredients, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. however, ophthalmic formulations of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones differ in terms of the inclusion of preservatives. while gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3% (zymar; allergan, inc., irvine, ca, usa) contains 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (bak), moxifloxacin  ophthalmic solution 0.5% (vigamox; alcon laboratories, inc., fort worth, tx, usa) is preservative-free. recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of bak dramatically affects the antibacterial activity of the ophthalmic formulation of  gatifloxacin. this study was designed to compare the kill rates of ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones against isolates of common ocular bacterial pathogens. methods: approximately 5.6 log(10) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of haemophilus influenzae (n=1), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), staphylococcus aureus (n=2), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=4), methicillinresistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (n=4), and fluoroquinolone-resistant s. epidermidis (n=1) were incubated with ophthalmic solutions of either gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. viable bacteria were quantified at specific time points up to 60 minutes. results: gatifloxacin 0.3% completely eradicated h. influenzae and strep. pneumoniae in 5 minutes, one of two s. aureus isolates in 15 minutes, and the other s. aureus isolate in 60 minutes. gatifloxacin 0.3% completely killed all mrsa, mrse, and fluoroquinolone-resistant s. epidermidis isolates in 15 minutes. moxifloxacin 0.5% completely eradicated strep. pneumoniae and one of four mrsa isolates in 60 minutes. all other isolates incubated with moxifloxacin 0.5% retained viable bacteria ranging from 1.8 to 4.4 log(10) cfu/ml. conclusions: the ophthalmic solution of gatifloxacin 0.3% eradicated bacteria that frequently cause postoperative ocular infections substantially faster than did the ophthalmic solution of moxifloxacin 0.5%.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (ec) enhances the activities of  aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus gordonii. this phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. the purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against p. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and s. epidermidis. an eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or ec to biofilm-coated coupons were used. no significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) cfu/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for s. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. we  detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes ec were used against mrsa biofilms (p = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes ec against s. epidermidis biofilms (p = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). the results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of  the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by ec is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.

TI  == bacterial resistance surveillance in china: a report from mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in china. a total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15  cities throughout china. antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by clinical and  laboratory standards institute. the results of the mics revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of  staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of staphylococcus epidermidis strains. penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. five strains of enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. all staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. a high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the gram-positive cocci. enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation  cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. about 65% of the escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less  than 10%. imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant  isolates. combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. amikacin was active against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. in conclusion,  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive s. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in china. no glycopeptides-resistant staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci was seldom.

TI  == emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. this resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of sccmec elements by susceptible ancestors has  taken place at different times and at different locations. among staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. also  in streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. they became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.

TI  == a critical review of oxazolidinones: an alternative or replacement for glycopeptides and streptogramins?
AB  == objective: to review the available data on the oxazolidinones linezolid and eperezolid. data selection: published reports were obtained by searching medline  for articles published between 1992 and 2000, inclusive. references of published  papers were also obtained and reviewed. abstracts from scientific proceedings were reviewed. data extraction: due to the limited data available regarding these agents, the criteria for study inclusion were not restrictive. data synthesis: the oxazolidinones (eg, linezolid) are a new antimicrobial class with a unique mechanism of action. they are active against resistant gram-positive cocci including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococccus epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). linezolid is active against anaerobes and displays modest activity against fastidious gram-negative pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae. linezolid is available  both orally and parenterally, and has a bioavailability of 100%. clinical trials  comparing linezolid with standard therapy have demonstrated similar bacteriological and clinical cures rates to standard therapy in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated and complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and infections caused by mrsa and vre. adverse effects have been minor and infrequent; however, platelets should be monitored in patients who have received more than two weeks of linezolid therapy. it is expected that these agents will have a bright future due to their excellent spectrum of activity against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms, such as mrsa, vre and prsp, and their excellent bioavailability. conclusion: the oxazolidinones represent a new class of antimicrobials with a unique mechanism of action. they have excellent activity against susceptible and resistant gram-positive organisms such as mrsa, methicillin-susceptible s epidermidis, vre and prsp, and a good adverse  effect profile; they can be administered both intravenously and orally. their potential use in canada may be as an intravenous and oral alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == synthesis, antibacterial activity, and quantitative structure-activity relationships of new (z)-2-(nitroimidazolylmethylene)-3(2h)-benzofuranone derivatives.
AB  == a new series of (z)-2-(1-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-2-ylmethylene)-3(2h)-benzofuranones (11a-p) and  (z)-2-(1-methyl-4-nitroimidazole-5-ylmethylene)-3(2h)-benzofuranones (12a-m) were synthesized and assayed for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. most of the 5-nitroimidazole analogues (11a-p) showed a remarkable inhibition of a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, mrsa, and bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas 4-nitroimidazole analogues (12a-m) were not effective against selected bacteria. the quantitative structure-activity relationship investigations were applied to find out the correlation between the experimentally evaluated activities with various parameters of the compounds studied. the qsar models built in this work had reasonable predictive power and could be explained by the observed trends in activities.

TI  == mode of antibacterial action of a signal peptide, pep27 from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of pep27  and its mode of action. the results indicated pep27 exhibited antibacterial activities against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria without hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, but it did not exhibit antifungal activity. to understand the mode of action of pep27, the cellular distribution of the peptide was investigated. flow cytometry analysis exhibited pep27 penetrated  the bacterial membrane by an energy-independent pathway without any damage to the membrane when examined using liposome and membrane probe. after penetration into  the bacterial cells, pep27 was not affected by macromolecular synthesis, but activated protein phosphatase activity in dose ranges of 10-15 microm and time range of 5-10 min in case of staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. these results demonstrated the antibacterial activities of pep27 are fundamentally attributable to a physiological change by activated phosphatase activity.

TI  == penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  == the authors topically administered gatifloxacin (gflx) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. they received 0.3% gflx ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for gflx concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. the mean intraoperative gflx concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/ml. gflx level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/ml in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/ml) in the patients less than 70 years old. this concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (mic90), such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) in vitro. the gflx concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, and mrsa in vitro.

TI  == implementation of a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations in canada.
AB  == background and objectives: bacterial screening in apheresis platelet preparations was implemented in march of 2004 by canadian blood services (cbs) using the bact/alert system. the aim of this study was to develop, validate and implement an in-house proficiency testing programme to evaluate cbs performance of bacterial screening in platelet preparations. study design and methods: during development of the proficiency testing programme, apheresis platelet preparations were spiked with 10(1) and 10(2) colony forming units per ml of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae. the preparations were stored at 2-8 degrees c prior to culture bottle inoculation with 4 or 6 ml on days 7-10 (estimated time from panel preparation to testing at  cbs centres). upon implementation, a combination of four proficiency panel members, including positives and negatives, were distributed to each of the centres that participated in the programme. a survey was conducted with 43 america's blood centers to assess whether they screen for bacterial testing in platelet preparations and whether they have implemented a proficiency testing programme. results: the development of the proficiency testing programme showed that s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa produced positive results at both concentrations and volumes on days 7-10 poststorage. streptococcus pneumoniae did not grow consistently and therefore was not selected for implementation of the programme. two proficiency testing panel sets have been issued (july 2006 and february 2007) with 14 out of 15 (93%) and 14 out of 14 (100%) of the participant centres meeting the expected results for bacterial screening, respectively. the majority (72%) of the america's blood centers that screen for bacterial contamination have not implemented a proficiency testing programme and 94.4% of these centres are interested in developing such a programme. conclusion: canadian blood services has successfully implemented a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations, which will contribute to improving  the safety of the platelet supply in canada.

AB  == a series of 3-(4'-(2''-alkyl-3''-oxy-1'',2'',4''-triazolyl)-phenyl)-5-substituted oxazolidinones was designed and synthesized for in vitro antibacterial activity testing against fourteen gram-negative and six gram-positive standard organisms.  the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by agar dilution at concentrations of 0.10, 0.20, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13, 6.25 microg/ml. different alkyl groups at the 2''-position played an important role in the activity against gram-positive organisms. (s)-3-(4'-(2''-ethyl-3''-oxy-1'',2'',4''-triazolyl)-phenyl)-5-acetamidomethyloxaz olidinone was active against staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus enteridis and streptococcus nonhemolyticus, whereas 2''-methyl, 2''-propyl and 2''-n-butyl counterparts did not show activity at 6.25 microg/ml. modification of the 5-substitutent of oxazolidinones also affected the activity against gram-positive organisms. (s)-3-(4'-(2''-ethyl-3''-oxy-1'',2'',4''-triazolyl)-phenyl)-5-acetamidomethyloxaz olidinones was approximately two fold more potent than 5-chloroacetamido, 5-dichloroacetamido and 5-trifluoroacetamido counterparts against streptococcus enteridis. none of these compounds showed growth inhibition against fourteen gram-negative organisms at 6.25 microg/ml.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

AB  == this paper reports on the isolation and identification of antibacterial constituents from the indigenous australian medicinal plant eremophila duttonii f. muell. (myoporaceae). preparations derived from this plant are used by indigenous populations in the topical treatment of minor wounds, otitis and ocular complaints, and as a gargle for sore throat. several authors have reported extracts of this plant to effect rapid bacteriolysis and inhibit growth of a wide range of gram-positive micro-organisms. in other studies involving screening of native medicinal plants for antibacterial activity, extracts of eremophila duttonii have been reported to consistently exhibit the highest potency amongst all species included. from a hexane extract, we identified two diterpenes of the  serrulatane class, the principal constituents responsible for antibacterial activity and present as major constituents of the resinous leaf cuticle: serrulat-14-en-7,8,20-triol (1) and serrulat-14-en-3,7,8,20-tetraol (2). in addition, a hydroxylated furanosesquiterpene with mild antibacterial activity which appeared to be a novel compound was isolated from the extract and tentatively identified as 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5-methyl[2,3'-bifuran]-5-yl) pentan-2-one. minimum inhibitory concentrations for each of the compounds against three gram-positive bacteria: staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), staphylococcus  epidermidis (atcc 12228) and streptococcus pneumoniae (arl 10582), were determined using a micro-titre plate broth dilution assay.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

AB  == purpose: to determine whether a combination of early amniotic membrane transplantation (amt) and early topical corticosteroid treatment could be a safe  adjuvant therapy during antibacterial treatment in severe bacterial keratitis (bk) for relieving pain, avoiding iatrogenic epithelial toxicity, and allowing earlier use of topical steroids. methods: in a prospective noncomparative case series, 12 patients with severe microscopically-proven bk were treated with immediate maximal topical antibiotics followed by amt at 48 hours (single-layer epithelial side-down or multilayer epithelial side-up), plus topical steroid treatment at 72 hours. pain relief (nrs-11 numeric rating pain scale) and the corneal epithelium healing were measured. results: the follow-up rate was 7.5 person-months, with amt performed once in 2 patients and twice in 10 patients with bk caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), moraxella cattharalis (1), staphylococcus aureus (1), staphylococcus epidermidis  (2), or streptococcus pneumoniae (1). a significant decrease in the pain score was noted from the admission day (median, 8; range, 7-10) to shortly after amt (at day 3: median, 2; range, 1-3). epithelial healing was achieved between 8 and  45 days (mean, 25.5 +/- 9.7 days). neither perforation nor neovascularization was observed. conclusions: early amt combined with topical corticosteroid in severe bk provides immediate pain relief and allows epithelial healing.

TI  == dry reagent dipstick test combined with 23s rrna pcr for molecular diagnosis of bacterial infection in arthroplasty.
AB  == periprosthetic joint infections present a challenging problem in orthopaedics. conventional methods for detection of arthroplasty infections rely on bacterial culture of synovial fluid aspirates. during recent years, however, molecular tests that are based on dna amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), followed by electrophoretic analysis of the products, have been introduced. we report a simple and inexpensive assay that allows visual detection and confirmation of the pcr-amplified sequences by hybridization within minutes. the  assay is performed in a dry reagent dipstick format (strip) and does not require  special instrumentation. universal primers are used for pcr of the 23s ribosomal  rna (rrna) gene. the biotinylated amplification product is hybridized with da-tailed probes that are specific for six pathogens commonly involved in periprosthetic joint infections. the mixture is applied to the strip, which is then immersed in the appropriate buffer. the buffer migrates along the strip by capillary action and rehydrates gold nanoparticles with oligo(dt) strands attached to their surface. the nanoparticles bind to the target dna through hybridization, and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone of the strip, producing a characteristic red line. unbound nanoparticles are captured by immobilized oligo(dt) strands at the control zone of the strip, generating a second line. the dipstick test was applied to the detection of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faesium, and haemophilus influenza. twelve samples of synovial fluids from patients were analyzed for the detection and identification of the infection caused by the six pathogens. the results were compared with bacterial cultures.

TI  == pyrazolidine-3,5-diones and 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-ones, inhibitors of udp-n-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase.
AB  == a series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one inhibitors  of escherichia coli udp-n-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (murb) has been prepared. the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-ones show low micromolar ic(50) values versus e. coli murb and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against staphylococcus aureus gc 1131, enterococcus faecalis gc 2242, streptococcus pneumoniae gc 1894, and e. coli gc 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. none of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the  amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. a partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving murb potency and mic values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the c-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one core. docking studies using flo and pharmdock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the murb active site.

TI  == capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the ph range 2-5 in a dynamically modified fs capillary with uv detection.
AB  == the isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the ph range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. in this work, we suggest a cief method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the ph range of 2-5. it includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). this polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of  acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient cief. in order to trace of ph gradients, low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the mixed cultures of microorganisms, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, ccm 8223, proteus vulgaris, klebsiela pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus ccm 3953, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224 and staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418, were focused and separated by the cief method suggested here. this cief method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).

TI  == search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected indian medicinal plants.
AB  == a series of 61 indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against bacillus cereus var mycoides, bacillus pumilus, bacillus  subtilis, bordetella bronchiseptica, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and saccharomyces cerevisiae. twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at  least one of the test organisms used in the screening. on the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of dorema ammoniacum, sphaeranthus indicus, dracaena cinnabari, mallotus philippinensis, jatropha gossypifolia, aristolochia indica, lantana camara, nardostachys jatamansi, randia dumetorum and cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. this probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.

TI  == bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell disease in africa: is pneumococcal prophylaxis justified?
AB  == background: the high frequency of streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (ss) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. the reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in ss disease in africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the  need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. methods: a study of blood cultures in 155 ugandan children (165 episodes) with ss disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees c, attending the university teaching hospital in kampala (uganda, east africa). results: positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of  streptococcus viridans, escherichia coli and an unidentified gram negative rod. streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. conclusion: the infrequent isolation of streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with ss disease in this study and in four other studies from nigeria raises questions on  a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. there are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient  doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. these data are necessary to  determine its role in african children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial africa.

TI  == promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  == this paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pa-v-f) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. the vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in d-ala-d-ala. the fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. flow  cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled s. aureus and s. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled s. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled s. pneumoniae were opsonized. the bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured j774 macrophage-like cells. flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested s. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than s. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of s. aureus by macrophages). this paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, novel inhibitors of udp-n- acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (murb) with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of udp-n-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (murb). compounds 1 to 3, which are  1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited escherichia coli murb, staphyloccocus aureus murb, and e. coli mura with 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microm, 4.3 to 10.3  microm, and 6.8 to 29.4 microm, respectively. compound 4, a c-4-unsubstituted 1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory activity against e. coli murb, s. aureus murb, and e. coli murc (ic50s, 24.5 to 35 microm). a fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3 with e. coli murb, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nm. structural characterization of e. coli murb was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 a resolution. the crystal structure indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of murb and specific interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide  cofactor. peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of staphylococcus epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with ic50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microm. antibacterial activity was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (mics, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (mics, 4 to  8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == pcr evaluation of false-positive signals from two automated blood-culture systems.
AB  == rapid detection of micro-organisms from blood is one of the most critical functions of a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. automated blood-culture systems reduce the time needed to detect positive cultures, and reduce specimen handling. the false-positive rate of such systems is 1-10%. in this study, the presence of pathogens in 'false-positive' bottles obtained from bactec 9050 (becton dickinson) and bact/alert (biomerieux) systems was investigated by eubacterial and fungal pcr. a total of 169 subculture-negative aerobic blood-culture bottles (104 bact/alert and 65 bactec) were evaluated. both fungal  and eubacterial pcrs were negative for all bactec bottles. fungal pcr was also negative for the bact/alert system, but 10 bottles (9.6%) gave positive results by eubacterial pcr. sequence analysis of the positive pcr amplicons indicated the presence of the following bacteria (number of isolates in parentheses): pasteurella multocida (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), staphylococcus hominis (1), micrococcus sp. (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), corynebacterium spp. (2), brachibacterium sp. (1) and arthrobacter/rothia sp. (1). antibiotic usage by the  patients may be responsible for the inability of the laboratory to grow these bacteria on subcultures. for patients with more than one false-positive bottle, molecular methods can be used to evaluate the microbial dna in these bottles. false positives from the bactec system may be due to elevated patient leukocyte counts or the high sensitivity of the system to background increases in co(2) concentration.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the leader 2004 surveillance program.
AB  == since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has  been gained. however, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the united states has  not been reported. the leader 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), 428 enterococcus faecalis, 196 enterococcus faecium, and 422 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. all s. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 = 2 microg/ml); mic distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. for cns, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered  (staphylococcus epidermidis; mic = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the mic(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with s. aureus. for e. faecalis and e. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. both species had an mic90 of 2 microg/ml, and mic distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the s. pneumoniae isolates. these findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed  so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.

TI  == a study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: the optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. multiple site cultures may  improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. we hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a  single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. objective: to determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in  the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. design/methods: clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis.  a minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. results: a total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. in all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. in all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. all neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. the other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. the single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (3), combined mrsa and candida albicans (2), candida albicans alone (2), late-onset group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gbs) (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), enterococcus fecalis (1), escherichia coli (1), and serratia marcescens (1). since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. conclusions: two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood  volume of>or=1 ml.

AB  == rep8839 is a novel methionyl-trna synthetase (mets) inhibitor with potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and other clinically important gram-positive bacteria but little activity against gram-negative bacteria. all isolates of s. aureus, including strains resistant to methicillin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and linezolid  were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.5 microg/ml. rep8839 was also active against staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains (mic, < or =0.25 microg/ml). all s. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.25 microg/ml, suggesting that mets2, a second enzyme previously identified in streptococcus pneumoniae, was not present  in this organism. rep8839 was highly bound to the protein of human serum, and activity was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was affected by ph, exhibiting optimal antibacterial activity in a neutral medium rather than a weak  acidic medium. like mupirocin, rep8839 exhibited bacteriostatic activity against  key pathogens. the emergence of mupirocin resistance in s. aureus highlights the  need for a new topical antibiotic with the ability to inhibit high-level mupirocin-resistant strains and other emerging phenotypes, such as vancomycin-resistant and community-acquired methicillin-resistant isolates.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  == blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in akwa ibom state and analyzed for the presence of salmonella species and other bacteria. of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. female subjects were more infected than males. the commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella paratyphi and salmonella typhi. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, k. aerogenes, s. faecalis, proteus mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were s. aureus, e. coli, s. typhi, s. paratyphi, shigella sp, k. pneumoniae, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae 01. the isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. these antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. the results suggest the existence  of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. this is worrisome, since some of the s. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == pd-140248 (parke-davis & co).
AB  == pd-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase ii inhibitor under development by parke-davis and co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in september 1999, the company confirmed that pd-140248 is still in active development [338530]. the compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being pd-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. pd-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (s aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis (s epidermidis), staphylococcus haemolyticus (s haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae (s pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis (e faecalis). an mic90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against haemophilus influenzae (h influenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. the (3r,1s) enantiomer, pd-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].

TI  == evaluation of pooled cultures for bacterial detection in whole blood-derived platelets.
AB  == background: the bact/alert (biomerieux) system is highly efficient for bacterial  detection in apheresis platelets (plts) and whole blood-derived plts produced by  the buffy-coat method. detection of bacterial contamination in whole blood-derived plts produced by the plt-rich plasma (prp) method, however, is problematic. prestorage pooling of these plts is not permitted in some countries  including canada and the united states, and culturing individual units is costly  and may significantly reduce the plt unit content. in this study, the sensitivity and specificity of bact/alert cultures performed on pools derived from prp plts are reported. study design and methods: the sensitivity of the bact/alert system  was evaluated for bacterial detection in prp plts with a dilution effect. thirty  plt pools were produced with 1 plt unit previously spiked with bacteria and then  pooled with other four nonspiked plt units. three bacteria, usually associated with plt contamination, were selected for spiking. the specificity of this method was evaluated in 40 nonspiked plt pools. results: the method was found to be 100  percent specific and 97 percent sensitive. of the five spiked pools with streptococcus pneumoniae at levels of less than 2 colony-forming units (cfus) per ml, four were found to be positive whereas all 25 spiked pools with greater than  9 cfus per ml of any of the chosen bacteria gave positive results. the mean time  of detection was 17 to 19 hours for staphylococcus epidermidis and 14 to 15 hours for s. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa when spiked with similar bacterial inocula. conclusion: the evaluated system is highly sensitive and specific and may be a feasible method for bacterial detection in prp plts.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-023 (ro4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-023 (ro4908463, formerly r-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the c-2  position. its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. cs-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cs-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against p. aeruginosa and mrsa, with mics at  which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. cs-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris. cs-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the in vivo  efficacy of cs-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of prsp (serotypes 6 and 19). against the systemic infections with prsp, mrsa, and p. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of cs-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin  (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against p. aeruginosa infections only). these results suggest that cs-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the fixed combination of fortified vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solution--va solution: in vitro study of the potency and stability.
AB  == purpose: we compared the in vitro potency and stability of a fixed combination of vancomycin and amikacin solution (va solution) with amikacin or vancomycin solution. methods: solutions of 2% amikacin (20 mg/ml) and of 5% vancomycin (50 mg/ml) and va solution (each 1 ml contained 20 mg of amikacin and 50 mg of vancomycin) were prepared from parenteral antibiotics by reconstituting them with sterile injection water and refrigerated (4 degrees c) in the dark. triplicate 5-ml portions of each solution were tested before storage and 7 and 14 days after preparation for potency of antimicrobial activity by the disk diffusion method and for stability. results: there were no significant differences in the diameter of zones of inhibition of va solution compared with amikacin or vancomycin solution within a 2-week period. visual inspection revealed that all solutions remained clear, colorless, and particle-free at 4 degrees c throughout the study  period. for osmolarity, the va solution was much higher than that of either amikacin or vancomycin solution at all tested times and more near the well-tolerated range of human eyes. there were no significant differences at days 0, 7, or 14 for either vancomycin, amikacin, or va solution. for ph, the va solution was higher than that of vancomycin solution (nearly equal to that of amikacin solution) at each time and more near the level of normal tear film. the  ph did not differ significantly for either vancomycin, amikacin, or va solution at all tested times. conclusions: the vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solutions can be mixed together with the same potency and stable physical properties. it may be useful in the treatment of bacterial keratitis pending clinical trials to determine its effectiveness and safety.

TI  == the streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  == antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group a molecules and group b molecules, acting in synergy. the combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group a or group b molecule  alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. the semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. the streptogramins block the translation of mrna into protein. both group a and group b molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. the group b molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-trna from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. the group a molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-trna to the ribosomal a site and the formation of the peptide bond. when the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group  a molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the  ribosome for the b molecule is increased. this accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. this synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group b molecules alone.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == in vitro bacterial adherence to ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
AB  == bacterial adherence to medical devices has been recognized as an important initial step in the infectious process, but it has not been fully elucidated regarding ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunts. the aim of the present study was to quantitatively determine the adherence in vitro of bacteria known to cause vp shunt infections and to identify factors affecting the process. clinical isolates studied included staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. adherence was examined quantitatively per square centimeter, visualized by electron microscopy and related to slime production and hydrophobicity. although all four strains adhered to vp shunts, there were marked differences, with s. epidermidis and s. aureus showing the highest adherence (67.0 x 10(3) and 15.2 x 10(3) bacteria/cm(2), respectively). factors affecting adherence included incubation time and temperature, bacterial concentration, device material (lower for silicone than teflon), slime production and hydrophobicity. these data might be helpful for devising novel strategies to  reduce vp shunt infections.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == acute neck infections in children.
AB  == a retrospective review was conducted on 132 patients aged between two and 15 years with cervical lymphadenitis and/or with abscess formation to determine the  epidemiologic and clinical presentation of these infections. the most common locations were the upper anterior cervical space (43.2%) and the submandibular space (27.3%). the duration of symptoms ranged from 12 hours to 20 days. results  of the pus cultures were available in 31 patients (23.5%). of these, 16 cultures  (51.6%) were positive. the isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus (50%), staphylococcus epidermidis (31.3%), group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (12.5%), streptococcus pneumoniae (6.3%) and escherichia coli (6.3%). one of the specimens yielded mixed organisms (staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae). penicillin resistance was documented in six (37.5%) of the 16 gram-positive bacteria isolated from the pus culture. both throat and blood cultures were available in all 132 patients. seven throat cultures (5.3%) were positive for group a beta hemolytic streptococci, whereas five blood cultures (3.8%) were reported to have bacterial growth. sixty-seven patients (50.8%) were  treated with ampicillin-sulbactam, 53 patients (40.1%) with ampicillin-sulbactam  and ornidazole and 12 patients (9.1%) with ceftriaxone parenterally. the mean duration of hospital stay related to the infection was 7.30 +/- 3.89 days (range, 2-28 days). the mean period for downsizing of the cervical mass by half was 4.05  +/- 2.05 days, and the recovery period (total antibiotic usage period) was 13.72  +/- 5.33 days. all of the patients had an uneventful recovery without complications. results of both throat and blood cultures were not predictive for  etiologic agents in our study group. since ultrasonographic evaluation of each patient has limited additional benefits in clinical management, it must be reserved for selected cases to document abscess formation.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  == objective: to investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. methods: susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the e-test method. pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. three identical studies were conducted using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. after 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. the main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. results: in vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the mic of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin  and ofloxacin for p. aeruginosa. pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a  denuded epithelium. all serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the s. aureus model and a similar decrease in the s pneumoniae and p aeruginosa models. conclusions: topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. clinical relevance trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.

TI  == topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (aomt) in pediatric patients. methods: this multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an aomt episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. the  mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. clinical signs and symptoms of aomt were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). a patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. principal pretherapy pathogens included streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), s epidermidis (10.2%), and moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). results: ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. no change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. conclusion: topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of aomt.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [etiological profile of bacterial meningitis in a small hospital]
AB  == objective: to determine the etiologic profile of cases of meningitis treated at a small hospital in ribeirao preto, state of sao paulo, and to compare it to those  reported for other communities.methods: a retrospective study was conducted on 103 patients admitted from january 1992 to july 1996 with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. the clinical criteria for diagnosis were based on patient history and physical signs and symptoms, and the laboratory criteria were based on cerebrospinal fluid examination (aspect, cytology, biochemistry, gram staining, culture and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) and blood culture.results: the etiologic agent was identified in 81.5% of cases: haemophilus influenzae type b in 32%, neisseria meningitides in 25.2%, streptococcus pneumoniae in 8.7%, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis in 8.7%,  and others agents in 6.9%. conclusions: the study showed that the cases of bacterial meningitis treated at the santa lydia hospital of ribeirao preto are caused by the same agents detected in other places, with haemophilus influenzae type b being the predominant one. the study also suggests that when many people are involved in the collection of material for laboratory tests, recovery of the  agent may become difficult.

TI  == hiv infected adults do not have an excess of colonising bacteria in their large airways.
AB  == background: hiv infected adults have increased susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia but the underlying immune defect is poorly understood. we tested the hypothesis that hiv infection might be associated with increased bacterial colonisation of distal airways by nasal flora, which would then predispose patients to bacterial pneumonia. methods: healthy volunteer adults with normal chest radiographs were recruited. bronchoscopy was carried out and uncontaminated mucosal samples were collected from proximal and distal sites in the large airways using a protected specimen brush. samples were cultured to detect typical respiratory tract colonising organisms, and the proportion of samples found to contain colonising bacteria compared between hiv infected and uninfected subjects using non-parametric tests. results: forty-nine subjects were studied of whom 27  were hiv infected. colonising bacteria were identified in the nasopharynx of all  subjects including streptococcus pneumoniae in 6/49 subjects (5 hiv uninfected).  colonising bacteria were found in the distal airway of 6 subjects (3/27 hiv infected vs 3/22 hiv uninfected; chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.8). streptococcus pneumoniae  was identified in the trachea of all subjects with nasal colonisation but in the  distal airway of only 1 subject. conclusions: there was no evidence to support a  hypothesis of increased airway bacterial colonisation in healthy hiv infected subjects.

TI  == an engineered multidomain bactericidal peptide as a model for targeted antibiotics against specific bacteria.
AB  == we constructed a peptide consisting of a staphylococcal agrd1 pheromone fused to  the channel-forming domain of colicin ia and named it pheromonicin. this fusion peptide had bactericidal effects against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa, respectively), but not against staphylococcus epidermidis or streptococcus pneumoniae. growth rates, vital staining and colony forming unit (cfu) counts showed that pheromonicin did  not merely suppress growth but killed s. aureus cells. the specificity of pheromonicin was shown by the absence of bactericidal effects against an accessory gene regulator (agr) locus knockout of s. aureus, and a dose-dependent  inhibition of the bactericidal effects of pheromonicin by competition with corresponding free agrd pheromone. in vivo, all pheromonicin-treated mice survived administration of mrsa that was lethal to controls. no toxicity was detectable in human liver or renal cells in culture, or in livers, kidneys or spleens of pheromonicin-treated mice. the results suggest that these types of chimeric peptides may be of value as antibiotics against specific bacterial infections.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the emergence of multi-drug resistant microorganisms presents a critical problem for patients undergoing surgery. acidic ph, which is produced by oxidized regenerated cellulose (orc), is a broad-spectrum physiological detriment to survival of microorganisms known to cause surgical infections. the purpose of  this study was to examine the antimicrobial effect of orc against antibiotic-resistant organisms. methods: orc products were challenged with atcc reference strains and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), and non-resistant atcc strains of s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. samples of three orc products (surgicel absorbable hemostat, surgicel fibrillar absorbable hemostat, and surgicel nu-knit absorbable hemostat and identified, respectively, as orc-r, orc-f, and orc-n for this study) were inoculated with challenge organisms in nutrient broth to produce a weight to volume ratio of 15 mg orc/ml. plate counts were performed at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h. results: antimicrobial activity was seen with all three orc products against the  challenge organisms. data indicate that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms remain susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of orc. in testing with nine of  10 bacteria, including four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates (vre, mrsa, and prsp) three-log or greater reductions were seen at 24-h exposure. one atcc strain of vre demonstrated some level of resistance to the acidic ph effect. orc-n showed a three-log reduction with this organism, whereas the reductions with orc-r and orc-f were less than one log. conclusion: since low ph affects a relatively broad-spectrum of bacteria and does not act in a mechanism-specific manner, as do antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are unlikely  to resist the orc ph effect. results of this in vitro assessment support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial activity of orc is effective against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == severe infective keratitis leading to hospital admission in new zealand.
AB  == aim: to identify key risk factors and the management and outcome of severe infective keratitis leading to public hospital admission in new zealand. methods: over a 2 year period, all admissions of presumed infective keratitis to auckland  hospital were identified. the clinical records of all 103 cases were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical features, risk factors, management, and outcomes. results: the mean time from first symptoms or signs and presentation to hospital was 8.9 (sd 15.5) days. the majority of subjects, 88%, had at least one of the risk factors commonly associated with infective keratitis including previous ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), and ocular trauma (24%). corneal scraping was performed in 92% and of a total of 105 scrapes, 71% were positive. bacteria were isolated in all these cases, the majority being gram positive organisms (72%). the most common isolates identified were coagulase negative staphylococcus (16%), propionibacterium acnes (14%), staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). in addition, yeasts were isolated in 5%, fungi in  4%, virus in 2%, and chlamydia in 1%. importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted for 33% of culture positive cases. antimicrobial treatment was changed  on the basis of culture results in 17 cases (16.5%). median initial visual and final best corrected visual acuity was 6/36-6/48 (logmar 0.86) (iqr 0.39-2.00) and 6/12-6/15 (logmar 0.360) (iqr 0.15-1.70), respectively. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use were significantly associated with poorer  visual acuity. the mean hospital stay was 5.8 days and the median 4.0 (iqr 2.0-8.0) days. longer duration of stay was associated with the presence of hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery, and poor visual acuity. conclusions: infectious keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity. a significant proportion of cases have potentially modifiable risk factors. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use, in particular, were associated with poorer visual outcomes. many cases of severe keratitis might be avoided, or their severity reduced, by appropriate education of patients and ophthalmologists.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). time killing curves against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae  were performed. serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in the urine series,  levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs cfu/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on e. coli (both), p. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and p. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). in the bronchial mucosa series,  s. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and k. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. in conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.

TI  == in vitro activity of s-3578, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of s-3578, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against clinical isolates was evaluated. the mics of the drug at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 4 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and 2 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, which were fourfold higher than and equal to those of vancomycin, respectively. the anti-mrsa activity of s-3578 was considered to be due to its high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.5 micro g/ml). in time-kill studies with 10 strains each of mrsa and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, s-3578 caused more than a 4-log(10) decrease of viable cells on the average at twice the mic after 24 h of exposure,  indicating that it had potent bactericidal activity. furthermore, in population analysis of mrsa strains with heterogeneous or homogeneous resistance to imipenem, no colonies emerged from about 10(9) cells on agar plates containing twice the mic of s-3578, suggesting the low frequency of emergence of s-3578-resistant strains from mrsa. s-3578 was also highly active against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), with a mic(90) of 1 micro g/ml, which was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. s-3578 also had antibacterial  activity against a variety of gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa, though its activity was not superior to that of cefepime. in conclusion, s-3578 exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and, particularly, had excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and prsp. thus, s-3578 was considered to be worthy of further evaluation.

TI  == discovery of a novel and potent class of fabi-directed antibacterial agents.
AB  == bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase (fabi) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. high-throughput screening of the staphylococcus aureus fabi enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against s. aureus. iterative medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(e)-n-methyl-n-(2-methyl-1h-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the fabi inhibition assay. compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving mics at which 90%  of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently  available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an s. aureus infection model in rats. biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of fabi. compound 4 also exhibits weak fabk inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, which depend on fabk and both fabk and fabi, respectively, for their enoyl-acp reductase function. these results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for  the treatment of s. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.

TI  == novel agents for resistant gram-positive infections--a review.
AB  == gram-positive infections have increased in recent years, particularly those that  are of nosocomial origin, leading to a broad use of agents with activity against  these pathogens. concomitantly, antimicrobial resistance of these pathogens also  became widespread. among the most common gram-positive resistant pathogens are: streptococcus pneumoniae, resistant to penicillin and macrolides, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediately-resistant s. aureus (gisa), methicillin-resistant s.  epidermidis, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the response of the pharmaceutical industry to this challenge  was the development of new antibiotics active against these pathogens. among these antibiotics, this review will focus on: linezolid, an oxazolidinone; gar-936, a tetracycline derivative; daptomycin, a lipopeptide; and ortivancin (ly-333328), a glycopeptide related to vancomycin. except for linezolid, which has been recently launched in many countries, all other agents referred to in this review are still at various developmental stages. it is hoped that in the near future most of these agents will be approved and thus the grim outlook of patients infected with resistant gram-positive bacteria may improve.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. the in vitro activity of t-3912 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant  s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the mic90 for the clinical isolates. the activity of t-3912 was not influenced by grla mutation in s. aureus, and the degree of mic increase of t-3912 for grla-gyra double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). the inhibitory activity of t-3912 was compared with other quinolones for dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv of  s. aureus sa113. t-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes  among the quinolones tested. the isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to t-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for s. aureus sa113 and p. acnes jcm 6425, respectively. furthermore, resistance to t-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. t-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and p. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. t-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by s. aureus sa113, p. acnes jcm6425 and multidrug-resistant s. aureus f-2161. these results indicate that t-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for  the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.

TI  == production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) induced by live gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. methods: in all, 49 different isolates were studied. each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of tnf-alpha and il-6 were measured  by enzyme immunoassays. results: there was a positive correlation between tnf-alpha and il-6 values, r=0.9. gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both tnf-alpha and il-6 than gram-positive bacteria. group g streptococci (ggs) induced higher levels of tnf-alpha than streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus  aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and group a streptococci (gas). klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of tnf-alpha than haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis. ggs induced higher levels of il-6 than staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and gas. when the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations  measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. conclusion: species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin with ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone. the in-vitro antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid against 165 streptococcal isolates, 369 staphylococcal isolates, and 50 enterococcal isolates recently recovered from clinical isolates. gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested against streptococci including penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml). imipenem and gatifloxacin (mic(90) 0.5 microg/ml) were the most active agents tested against viridans group streptococci. all the agents demonstrated excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus. imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and gatifloxacin had good activity against methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis. among the methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, gatifloxacin was the most active agent. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and gatifloxacin were the most active agents against e. faecalis. thus, gatifloxacin possesses equal or superior activity when compared to ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams making it a promising new fluoroquinolone for clinical use in treating gram-positive infections.

TI  == clear corneal wound infection after phacoemulsification.
AB  == objective: to evaluate clear corneal wound infections after phacoemulsification.  materials and methods: the medical records of 7 patients with clear corneal wound infections after phacoemulsification were reviewed retrospectively. data that were reviewed included patient age, sex, onset of symptoms and signs after surgery, possible risk factors for infection, concomitant ocular disease, use of  perioperative prophylactic antibiotics and steroids, culture and antibiotic sensitivity results, treatment regimen, and outcome. results: the median onset of signs and symptoms after surgery was 10 days (range, 4-60 days). corneal cultures yielded methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 2 cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in 1 case, and staphylococcus epidermidis in 1 case. cultures yielded  no microorganisms for 1 patient. corneal cultures were not obtained in 2 patients. in 3 of the 4 culture-positive cases, the isolated microorganisms were  resistant to the perioperative prophylactic antibiotics (fluoroquinolones and tobramycin) that were used. no possible risk factors were noted except use of topical steroids 4 times a day without antibiotic coverage for iritis before referral in one of our patients. six of these 7 wound infections healed with topical antibiotic therapy. one of the patients required lamellar keratectomy and conjunctival flap for complete healing. in 4 of the 7 cases, best-corrected visual acuity at the last follow-up visit was better than 20/40. conclusions: clear corneal wound infection after phacoemulsification is a serious complication of cataract surgery. infections are caused by gram-positive organisms sensitive to bacitracin and the combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but often resistant to aminoglycosides and/or fluoroquinolones.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == structure and dissemination of a chromosomal insertion element encoding macrolide efflux in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == macrolide resistance associated with macrolide efflux (mef) has rapidly increased in streptococcus pneumoniae. we defined the genetic structure and dissemination of a novel mefe-containing chromosomal insertion element. the mefe gene was found on the 5' end of a 5.5- or 5.4-kb insertion designated as the macrolide efflux genetic assembly (mega), which is found in > or =4 distinct sites of the pneumococcal genome. the element was transformable and conferred macrolide resistance to susceptible s. pneumoniae. the first 2 open-reading frames (orfs) of the element formed an operon composed of mefe and a predicted adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette homologous to msra. convergent to this efflux operon were 3 orfs with homology to stress response genes of tn5252. mega was related to the recently described mefa-containing element tn1207.1 but lacked the genes necessary for transposition and had unique termini and insertion sites. in  metropolitan atlanta, macrolide resistance due to mega rapidly increased in s. pneumoniae by clonal expansion and horizontally by transformation.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == an in vitro pharmacokinetic model was used to compare the pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against 3 staphylococcus aureus and 3 staphylococcus epidermidis strains. logarithmic-phase cultures were inoculated into the peripheral compartment of hollow-fiber cartridges and exposed to the peak serum concentrations achieved in humans with oral doses of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (500 mg). drugs were added at 0 and 24 h, elimination kinetics were simulated, and changes in viable bacterial counts were evaluated over the course of 36 h. moxifloxacin was bactericidal against all 6 staphylococci (times to 99.9% kill, 1-3 h). against most strains, bacterial killing continued through 36 h, with total kills exceeding 5.5 logs. levofloxacin was bactericidal against 5 of the strains, with similar times to 99.9% kill. in contrast to moxifloxacin, however, resistant subpopulations emerged in 4 strains  during therapy with levofloxacin, and this could have important implications for  treatment of staphylococcal infections. these in vitro observations warrant the clinical evaluation of moxifloxacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to staphylococcus aureus and rarely staphylococcus epidermidis, kingella kingae,  enterobacteriaciae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. patient 1. a 10-year-old male presented with  6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. the patient had a temperature of 104 degrees f. laboratory tests were within normal limits, except  for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), which was 58 mm/hour. blood culture showed no growth. magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra  disk. there was no other abnormality. a computed tomography (ct)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic  and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and gram-positive cocci in chains. cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. the patient was treated with intravenous penicillin  600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every  6 hours for 3 weeks. the back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the esr returned  to normal at the end of therapy. follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. patient 2. an 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. he had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he  received no therapy. the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees f, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. laboratory tests were normal, except for  the esr (42 mm/hour). radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. a ct scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. ct-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform gram-negative bacilli.  anaerobic culture grew light growth of fusobacterium nucleatum. the organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. back pain resolved within 2 weeks. a 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. this report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. the lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. this is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. this was the case in our second patient, who was infected by f nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. the origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. the presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. the preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have  been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of f nucleatum. p magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. this report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == [bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  == the authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. as a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. the assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux  diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. in the wake of the analysis made, e. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, streptococcus spp, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae. as regards  drug-sensitivity, e. coli & enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  == development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. the normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. horizontal spread  of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. an  ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. experience from scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of  use is low (about 5%) and stable.

TI  == micro-organisms responsible for osteo-articular infections.
AB  == identification of the aetiological agents responsible for bone and joint infections requires either hard to obtain specimens that are easy to interpret, or easy to obtain specimens of difficult interpretation. isolates obtained by blood cultures, arthrocentesis, or trephine or surgical biopsy bone samples are usually clinically significant. in contrast, samples obtained from sinus tracts or through open wounds are very often easy to obtain but difficult to interpret.  micro-organisms such as staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common cause of infections around prosthetic joint materials but are usually of little significance when obtained from the sinus tract of a patient with chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia without osteosynthesis. other micro-organisms to be interpreted with caution include corynebacterium spp. and enterococcus spp. the most important families of antimicrobial agents and their utility in bone and joint infections are briefly reviewed at the end of the chapter. bone and joint infections require long-term antimicrobial therapy based on the correct diagnosis and the appropriate selection of antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == in vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  == purpose: time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and haemophilus influenzae. methods: for time-kill studies,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the mic (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final  concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/ml in each antibiotic solution. growth controls were included. viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10,  20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. results: in general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the mic were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. at 0.5 x mic, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin  and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. at 1.0 x mic, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus within 30 minutes, and s. epidermidis and s. marcescens within 90 minutes. overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for h. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of s. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. conclusion: time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.

TI  == the fib locus in streptococcus pneumoniae is required for peptidoglycan crosslinking and pbp-mediated beta-lactam resistance.
AB  == penicillin resistance in pneumococci is mediated by modified penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) that have decreased affinity to beta-lactams. in high-level penicillin-resistant transformants of the laboratory strain streptococcus pneumoniae r6 containing various combinations of low-affinity pbps, disruption of the fib locus results in a collapse of pbp-mediated resistance. in addition, crosslinked muropeptides are highly reduced. the fib operon consists of two genes, fiba and fibb, homologous to staphylococcus aureus fema/b which are also required for expression of methicillin resistance in this organism. fiba and fibb belong to a family of proteins of gram-positive bacteria involved in the formation of interpeptide bridges, thus representing interesting new targets for  antimicrobial compounds for this group of pathogens.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  == adherence of haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [gorter et al. (1998) j. infect. dis. 178, 1067-1078]. in this study, we showed that the adherence of h. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). defensins stimulated also the adherence of moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae to the nci-h292 cell line. in contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. these results suggest that the defensin-enhanced  adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.

AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with topical lomefloxacin 0.3% compared to topical ofloxacin 0.3%.
AB  == purpose: the main purpose of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy,  local tolerance, and safety of topical lomefloxacin 0.3% and topical ofloxacin 0.3% in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. patients and methods: forty patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis were included in a randomized, prospective, parallel-group study. twenty patients were assigned to the lomefloxacin group (okacin, ciba vision ophthalmics) and 20 patients to ofloxacin (oflox, allergan). lomefloxacin 0.3% was given 1 drop every 2 hours during waking hours on the first day then twice daily for one week. ofloxacin 0.3% eyedrops were given four times daily. all patients underwent eye examination and clinical  findings were graded and recorded according to severity of lid hyperemia, lid edema, lid crusting, conjunctival edema and discharge, bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, palpebral conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, and ocular discomfort. the score for each clinical sign was recorded before and after treatment. the mean cumulative sum score (css) was obtained by adding the scores  for signs and symptoms. all conjunctival swabs were cultured and tested for sensitivity. patients with confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis were included. results: there were 10 male and 10 female patients in each group. the age range was from 1 to 78 years, and the mean age was 35 years in the lomefloxacin group.  in the ofloxacin group the age range was from 1 to 70 years, and the mean age was 26 years. there was no significant difference between the two groups in relation  to age or sex. the causative organisms were staphylococcus epidermidis in 16 cases (36%), alpha-hemolytic streptococci in 9 (20%), haemophilus spp. 6 (13%), staphylococcus aureus 5 (11%), streptococcus pneumoniae 4 (9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (7%), and other 2 (4%). the mean css for conjunctivitis was 12.1 before therapy in the lomefloxacin group and 12.7 in the ofloxacin group. on the  7th day of therapy, the mean css was 0.7 in the lomefloxacin group, and 1.6 for ofloxacin. all patients showed improvement, but a total of 18 out of 20 (88%) in  the lomefloxacin group showed complete resolution compared to 15 (75%) in the ofloxacin group. the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). tolerance was excellent in both groups, and no side effects were reported. a burning sensation was noted by two patients, one in each group. conclusions: lomefloxacin and ofloxacin were equally effective and safe in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

TI  == mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. in this study the binding of purified mbl  to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. diverse candida species, aspergillus fumigatus, staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group a streptococci exhibited strong binding of mbl, whereas  escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. in contrast, beta-hemolytic group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. bound mbl was able to promote c4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that mbl may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.

TI  == corneal ulceration in the elderly in hyderabad, south india.
AB  == aims: to report demographic, microbiological, therapeutic, anatomical, and visual results of corneal ulceration in the elderly patients seen at a tertiary eye care centre in south india. methods: 102 consecutive cases of microbial keratitis in patients 65 years and older were studied. inclusion criteria were: (i) presence of corneal stromal infiltrate upon slit lamp examination; and (ii) microbiological evaluation of corneal scrapings for suspected microbial keratitis. results: the principal predisposing factors identified in this study were ocular disease (38.2%), previous ocular surgery in the same eye (29.4%), trauma (17.6%), and severe systemic disease (16.7%). contact lens wear was associated with only two cases (2.0%). 99 organisms were isolated in cultures of  corneal scrapings from 74 (72.5%) of the 102 cases. staphylococcus epidermidis (31.1%), filamentous fungi (25.7%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (13.5%) were the most common isolates. 12 eyes (11.8%) required surgery, 15 (14.7%) eventually required evisceration, and nine (9.6%) of the 94 followed patients achieved an unaided vision of 20/60 or better at last follow up. conclusions: this work represents the largest recent single centre study on (non-viral) microbial keratitis in the elderly, its management, and outcomes of therapy. while the predisposing factors differ from those of general population, the spectrum of microbes responsible for keratitis in the elderly appears to reflect the local microbial flora rather than a predilection for elderly patients. delay in diagnosis and systemic conditions associated with advancing age probably contribute to poorer outcome from therapeutic measures.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide gram-positive spectrum.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == rapid detection of methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus isolates by the mrsa-screen latex agglutination test.
AB  == the slide agglutination test mrsa-screen (denka seiken co., niigata, japan) was compared with the meca pcr ("gold standard") for the detection of methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus. the mrsa-screen test detected the penicillin-binding protein 2a (pbp2a) antigen in 87 of 90 genetically diverse methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) stock culture strains, leading to a sensitivity of 97%. the three discrepant mrsa strains displayed positive results  only after induction of the meca gene by exposure to methicillin. both meca pcr and mrsa-screen displayed negative results among the methicillin-susceptible s. aureus strains (n = 106), as well as for micrococcus spp. (n = 10), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (n = 10), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 10), and enterococcus spp. (n = 10) (specificity = 100%). producing the same pbp2a antigen, all 10 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis strains score positived in both the latex test and the meca pcr. consequently, the mrsa-screen  test should be applied only after identification of the mrsa strain to the species level to rule out coagulase-negative staphylococci. in conclusion, due to excellent specificity and sensitivity the mrsa-screen latex test has the potential to be successfully used for routine applications in the microbiology laboratory.

AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  == a total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to staphylococcus aureus (200), staphylococcus epidermidis (200), streptococcus pneumoniae (20), escherchia coli (200), klebsiella spp. (177), serratia marcescens (22), pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), haemophilus influenzae (35) and salmonella (38) from the department of infectious diseases, la sapienza university in rome (italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of h. influenzae,  salmonella and s. pneumoniae, more than 75% of staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of enterobacteriaceae and 50% of p.  aeruginosa. minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for klebsiella, s. aureus and epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae. levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. regarding the distribution of resistant strains in italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as e. coli and p. aeruginosa were concerned. quality control parameters are also summarized. s. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. in fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. these results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.

TI  == bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in nottingham, uk, 1985-1996.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == regulation of chemokine gene expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils phagocytosing microbial pathogens.
AB  == production of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) by neutrophils is likely to be important in the regulation of inflammation and the control of infection. in this study we show that exposure of human neutrophils to various microbial pathogens leads to the production of both macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (mip-1alpha) and il-8. the bacterial microbes, salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus all strongly induced both il-8  and mip-1alpha secretion, whereas streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and the opportunistic yeast candida albicans were less potent. saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymosan both induced il-8 secretion but failed to stimulate that of mip-1alpha. coincubation of neutrophils with the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the micro-organisms also led to differential expression of mip-1alpha and il-8. significant enhancement of the induction of both mip-1alpha and il-8 by s. typhimurium, p. aeruginosa, and s. pneumoniae as well as by c. albicans was observed. in contrast, while il-8 production in response to s. cerevisiae and zymosan was enhanced in the presence  of tnf-alpha, no mip-1alpha was produced. these combined results indicate that while neutrophils exposed to some micro-organisms alone or in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-alpha will produce both mip-1alpha and il-8, resulting in generation of signals for the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes  and neutrophils, respectively, certain types of microorganisms can skew this response toward synthesis of il-8.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

AB  == enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). to assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151  consecutive csf bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. treatment decisions associated with individual csf specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with csf specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial  therapy based on the reporting of csf culture isolates. thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from  34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (candida tropicalis, proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second csf specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. thus, only a single isolate (3%; staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. in contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; cryptococcus neoformans, 10; streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). we conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from csf specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of csf broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == the purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (rxm). we measured the mics of macrolide antibiotics, such as rxm, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), rokitamycin (rkm) and midecamycin (mdm), and other classes  of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between october and december in 1994 and 1995. rxm had excellent antibacterial activities for s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem dz-2640.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. the in-vitro  spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant gram-positive aerobes, important gram-negative aerobes, gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive cocci. gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp. and mycoplasma spp. overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat gram-positive infections, including those caused  by multidrug-resistant organisms. since this activity extends to gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.

TI  == [infectious bursitis: study of 40 cases in the pre-patellar and olecranon regions].
AB  == background: septic bursitis usually affects subcutaneous localized bursae such the prepatellar and elbow bursae. this condition is infrequently reported in the  spanish medical literature. the aim of this report was to study patients suffering from septic bursitis with regard to predisposing conditions, the causative agents, therapy and clinical outcome. method: a retrospective study was undertaken in patients with infectious bursitis attended in the service of rheumatology of the povisa medical centre (vigo) and juan canalejo hospital (la coruna), spain, from january 1989 to january 1995. the diagnosis of septic bursitis was confirmed with positive bursal fluid cultures in all cases. results: we recovered forty cases of infectious bursitis (23 olecranon bursitis and 17 prepatellar bursitis). most patients were male (80%), and patient mean age was 52 years (range: 14-94). the most common predisposing factors to bacterial infection were steroid therapy (15%) and alcoholism (8%), in addition to cutaneous lesions  associated with occupational or recreational trauma (55%). prepatellar septic bursitis was associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation with fever (71% vs 48%), leukocytosis (76% vs 52%), cellulitis (59% vs 48%) and positive blood cultures (25% vs 0%). staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 87.5% of bursal fluid aspirations, the other etiologic microrganism were staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), streptococcus agalactiae (2 cases) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 case). the majority of patients (80%) required initial intravenous  therapy of which average duration was 11 days (range: 5-21 days). successful resolution of septic bursitis without open surgical drainage was seen in 38 patients (95%) and there ware no functional impairment, serious complications or  recurrences. conclusions: the majority of patients with septic bursitis suffered  systemic and/or local predisposing illness. s. aureus is the commonest pathogen.  prepatellar septic bursitis is associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation and bacteremia. usually, the prompt and proper antibiotic therapy make innecessary surgical drainage.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during the period of june 1995 to may 1996. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activities against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. vancomycin (vcm) and piperacillin (pipc) were also active with the  mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa vcm showed the highest activities against s. aureus isolated from  patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml against both s. aureus and mrsa. arbekacin (abk) was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. the other except minocycline (mino) had very low activities with the mic90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and mino showed the strongest activities against s. epidermidis isolated from patients with utis. the mic90s of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. vcm was also active with the mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. the mic90s of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml  in 1995. these results indicated that some resistances existed among s. epidermidis to cephems. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except gentamicin (gm) were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, cefmenoxime (cmx), ipm, erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic90s of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. citrobacter freundii ipm showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients utis. its  mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. gm was also active with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml. cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cmx, cpr and czop showed low activities with mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter  cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. mino and tosufloxacin (tflx)  were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. penicillins and cephems except cpr and czop showed lower activities with the mic90s of 256 micrograms/ml  or above. 7. escherichia coli. most of the antimicrobial agents were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. cmx and tflx were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. penicillins were slightly active with mic90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. carumonam (crmn) had the strongest activity against k. pneumoniae, the mics for all strains were equal to  or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of k. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. for example, the mic90s of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. proteus mirabilis p. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), and crmn showed the highest activities against p. mirabilis isolated from patients with utis. mics of crmn for all

TI  == bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  == this study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. the anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. then, the sample of  ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. the cultural rate was 60.9%. the most frequently isolated bacteria were streptococcus viridans, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis, and hemophilus parainfluenzae. conversely, only three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. the results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of  the ethmoid sinus more accurate.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. methods: two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different  administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. at  the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees c. antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. the  highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours  and 0800 hours, prior to operation. when applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). these mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. conclusion: of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. this fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial  management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomanas aeruginosa.

AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

AB  == fresh clinical isolates collected from november 1, 1992 through november 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including  fk037 and l-ofloxacin. among the 10 040 organisms tested were staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, n = 455), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), escherichia coli (n = 2326), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), proteus mirabilis (n = 445), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). both l-ofloxacin and fk037 inhibited 98% of s. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. fk037 was at least 4 times  more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against mrsa, inhibiting  79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. while the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == [clinical studies on acute otitis media in infants less than one year old].
AB  == epidemiological and bacteriological studies were made on 164 infants less than 1  year old with acute otitis media (oma) treated at the department of otorhinolaryngology, matsuyama red cross hospital between january 1991 and december 1993. the patients consisted of 101 males (61.6%) and 63 females (38.4%). compared with the general population in matsuyama city, the preponderance of male patients with oma is statistically significant at the level of p = 0.05. in infants less than 1 year old males are likely to be more susceptible to oma than females. one hundred and four patients among the 164 (63.4%) were referred by pediatricians. fever was the most common symptom (57.9%) and the next was otorrhea (19.5%). between the patients younger than 6 months (younger group) and those 6 months old or older (older group) there were epidemiological differences which were statistically significant at the level of  p = 0.05. the older group contained 128 patients (78.0%) and the younger group 36 (22.0%). the difference in incidence between the two groups indicates that infants 6 months old or older are more susceptible to oma than those younger than 6 months. in the older group 76.6% of the patients had bilateral oma, while in 38.9% of those in the younger group the oma was bilateral. in infants 6 months old or older bilateral involvement and, in contrast, in infants younger than 6 months unilateral involvement was more frequent. the period needed to cure oma was confirmed for 179 ears of 106 patients. for 80 (44.7%) of the 179 ears the period extended beyond 4 weeks. seventy-five of the 80 ears were those of patients in the older group. oma in the older group tended to be more resistant to treatment. the middle ear secretion of 117 ears was examined bacteriologically. specimens were collected from middle ear effusion of 99 ears following myringotomy and from otorrhea in 18 ears. cultures of 68 specimens were positive for one species of bacteria and 13 cultures yielded two species. streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and haemophilus influenzae were the three most common microorganisms in middle ear effusion. but it was considered that s. spidermidis was not pathogenic and was a result of contamination. in otorrhea s. aureus was frequently found. no difference in the results of bacteriological study was noted between the two groups. transplacental igg1 and igg2 antibodies to s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae are known to decrease after birth and their serum levels are lowest between ages 6 months and 1 year. then the serum levels of the immunoglobulins increase gradually with active production until age 4 years. the incidence and period of restitution of oma in infants less than 1 year old in the present study seem to reflect the above change in the serum levels of igg1 and igg2 mentioned. based on the above results emphasis is placed on close cooperation between the otolaryngologist and the pediatrician in the treatment of oma in an infant less than 1 year old. particularly careful follow-up is important in patients in the older age group because they tend to be more susceptible to oma and the disease is more resistant to treatment.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis after radial keratotomy.
AB  == purpose: to report the findings concerning three patients with endophthalmitis and one with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis radial keratotomy surgery. methods: one man referred with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis and three women referred with endophthalmitis were treated. results: after radial keratotomy surgery, during which no microperforation or macroperforation had been reported, a severe pseudomonas panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis developed in the man. all vision was lost in that eye. staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis developed in one woman, streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis  in the second woman and pseudomonas endophthalmitis in the third woman, after undergoing radial keratotomy procedures during which microperforations occurred.  in the latter patient, bilateral simultaneous surgery was performed, but only one eye became infected. the latter two infections resulted in light perception and hand motion vision respectively. in three cases, an initial keratitis was located in the inferior cornea. conclusions: severe bacterial endophthalmitis can occur after radial keratotomy surgery, even in the absence of microperforation during the procedure. any evidence of postoperative keratitis must be regarded seriously and treated aggressively. despite use of this approach, the effect on final visual acuity can be devastating.

TI  == the impact of bacteraemia on hiv infection. nine years experience in a large italian university hospital.
AB  == the object of this case control study was to evaluate the frequency, the risk factors, the microbiological spectrum and the outcome of 249 cases of bacteraemia observed in 209 hiv-infected patients, most them affected by aids. the rate of bacteraemia in the total yearly hiv-related admissions increased from 4% in 1985  to 13% in 1993. the more common aetiological agents of bacteraemia were: staphylococcus aureus (29.7%), non-typhoidal species of salmonella (14.1%), staphylococcus epidermidis (10.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae (8.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%). a mixed flora was found in 14% of the episodes. multivariate analysis of predisposing factors indicated that a low cd4+t-cell count (<0.2 x 10(9)/l) (p=0.01), use of central venous catheters (cvc) (p=0.01) and neutropenia (polymorphonuclear neutrophils <1.0 x 10(9)/l) (p=0.04) were independent risk factors for the development of bacteraemia. logistic regression  did not reveal any association of bacteraemia with intravenous drug abuse (on univariate analysis p=0.04). the response (31.8%). recurrences to specific therapy was favourable in 170 episodes (68.2%); death occurred in 79 (31.8%). recurrences arose in 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) of them died. the outcome of bacteraemia was influenced by a low number of cd4+t-cells (p<0.001) but not of polymorphonuclear cells. our findings suggest that bacteraemia is a relatively common event in hiv-infected patients, especially under particular conditions (e.g. intravenous drug abuse, use of cvc, neutropenia and a low cd4-t-cell count). it requires special attention from physicians who must recognise and treat the condition promptly at an early stage.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, du-6859a and dv-7751a, was investigated against strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. du-6859a and dv-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. furthermore, du-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. the bactericidal mechanisms of dv-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, du-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both str. pneumoniae and ent. faecalis. this may explain the unusually potent bactericidal  activity of this agent against these species. these results show that du-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.

TI  == factors associated with positive bacteriological cultures of chronic middle ear effusions.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria have been isolated from middle ear effusions in a number of studies. our aim was to identify factors which predispose to patients having positive cultures. over a 1-year period, prospective data were collected on patients admitted for myringotomy. middle ear effusions were collected at the time of surgery using specially designed traps, and underwent microscopy and culture. data on local weather parameters were obtained from the meteorological office in edinburgh, uk and compared with the patterns of positive cultures. a higher proportion of cultures were positive in october, november and december and in february and may than in the other months of the years. we were not able to relate these variations to any of the meteorological data, with the possible exception of relative humidity, or to any other variable.

TI  == bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in benin city and ekpoma in edo state were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. species isolated comprised staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), proteus mirabilis  (17%), alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). others included escherichia coli (3.3%), proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter spp, proteus morgani, haemophilus influenzae, providencia spp, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. the study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. results have indicated that staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.

TI  == the effect of ethanol ingestion on killing of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis by rat neutrophils.
AB  == the precise effects of chronic ethanol ingestion on the role of neutrophil function in pneumococcal pneumonia have not been fully delineated. in this study, the bactericidal capacity of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmnl) from rats pair-fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet or a liquid control diet was compared  both in vitro and in vivo. the pmnl were allowed to phagocytose several bacterial species in vitro, and intracellular killing after 1h was determined by plate counts. there was no significant difference in killing of streptococcus pneumoniae types 6b or 37, staphylococcus aureus or staphylococcus epidermidis by pmnl from ethanol-fed and pair-fed rats (e-pmnl and p-pmnl, respectively). however, e-pmnl killed significantly less of streptococcus pneumoniae types 10a,  14 and 19f. to corroborate these results in vivo, rats were infected transtracheally, and quantitative lung counts were performed 1 week post infection. streptococcus pneumoniae types 6b and 37, as well as staphylococcus aureus, were effectively cleared from the lungs of both groups of rats. streptococcus pneumoniae types 10a, 14 and 19f, however, were cleared well from the lungs of pair-fed but not ethanol-fed animals. these data suggest that chronic ethanol ingestion induces a strain-specific deficit in neutrophil bactericidal activity against certain s. pneumoniae which does not extend to commonly encountered staphylococci.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  == objectives: interstitial cystitis (ic) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. we tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would  be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with ic than  from control women. methods: urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 ic patients and 7 control subjects. these specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. in addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. results: cultures of urine from 6 of 11 ic patients grew five different bacteria (corynebacterium sp. klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of ic patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (p < 0.05). acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 ic patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens  that grew torulopsis. additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 ic patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of  1 control patient. biopsy specimens from 2 ic patients grew torulopsis sp or lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of pseudomonas sp or staphylococcus epidermidis, but  no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. all other cultures and stains were negative. conclusions: these data do not provide evidence that ic is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. however, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of ic patients than of control subjects. if these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of ic should be addressed.

TI  == phagocytosis of streptococcus pneumoniae measured in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis.
AB  == both humans and rats with liver cirrhosis have increased morbidity and mortality  from pneumococcal pneumonia. by use of a rat model of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis, uptake of fluorochrome-labeled streptococcus pneumoniae by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) and alveolar macrophages (am) was examined by flow cytometry. peripheral blood pmnl from cirrhotic rats showed no defect in phagocytic or bactericidal capacity for type 10a s. pneumoniae in vitro. however, in vivo, fewer type 3 s. pneumoniae were engulfed by pmnl in the lungs of cirrhotic rats with a concomitant increase in the number of organisms taken up by their am in comparison with controls. these studies indicate the importance of using more relevant in vivo methodologies for  assessing bacterial phagocytosis. in addition, the reduction in uptake of type 3  pneumococci by pmnl within the microenvironment of the cirrhotic rat lung could help to explain the increased susceptibility of cirrhotic rats to pneumococcal pneumonia.

AB  == six widely used x-ray contrast media (xrc) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using xrc to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of  using xrc in divided doses to reduce cost. preparations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) were inoculated into the following xrc: conray 280, hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, omnipaque 350, ultravist 300 and optiray 320 each in two concentrations. sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees c and 4 degrees c. there were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the gram-negative organisms. conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. most effects were bacteriostatic. organisms were  most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with xrc. no effect was seen with dilute xrc. all weekly sterility checks were negative. non-ionic xrc have no significant effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms and little effect on gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of xrc occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of xrc utilization.

TI  == [the present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and m. tuberculosis].
AB  == mechanisms of resistance of strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. the resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in s. aureus and s. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of dna, namely by gene meca. this gene codes altered pbp-2a protein. strains of s.pneumoniae contain pbp-1a, pbp-2b and pbp-2x proteins. they cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of  e. faecalis and e. faecium is coded by transferable vana and vanb genes. strains  of n. meningitidis produce mostly the altered pbp-2 protein. the increase of resistance in strains of m. tuberculosis is also significant.

TI  == opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect associated with rabbit primary aqueous humour.
AB  == viability curves were recorded for a variety of bacteria suspended in rabbit primary aqueous humour. controls included neat rabbit serum, dilute rabbit serum  (1/50), dilute heat treated fetal bovine serum (1/50), and balanced salt solution. rabbit aqueous humour was bactericidal in vitro for staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. micrococcus spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and  escherichia coli were not affected. the factor mediating the bactericidal effect  survives filtration (0.2 micron porosity) and freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees c) but is labile when stored in air at temperatures of 4 degrees c, 25 degrees c, and 37 degrees c for 1 hour. the bactericidal effect was stable when aqueous humour was stored in an atmosphere of 5% co2 at 37 degrees c for 3 hours. the antibacterial component in rabbit aqueous humour has yet to be identified.

TI  == the role of hsv-induced fc- and c3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  == herpes simplex virus type-1 (hsv-1) induces fc- and c3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. the role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to hsv-infected and non-infected hep-2 cells. a flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of fitc-labelled bacteria, was developed. opsonisation of staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in  adherence to hsv-infected cells and revealed a role for c3b(i)r- and fcr-mediated adhesion. however, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment  to non-infected cells. increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the hsv-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of e. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to hsv-infected cells.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

AB  == we assessed in vitro the antimicrobial activity of four agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, mupirocin, and imipenem) which are effective against gram-positive cocci causally associated with bacterial keratitis, as well as their corneal epithelial cytotoxicity. minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of strains (mic90s) against 10 strains each of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were as follows: vancomycin (mic90s 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), teicoplanin (mic90s 0.25-4 micrograms/ml, mupirocin (mic90s 0.12-4 micrograms/ml), and imipenem (mic90s 0.008-0.25 micrograms/ml, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci with mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml). cytotoxicity was assayed by uptake of 3h-thymidine by rabbit corneal epithelial cell cultures  at drug concentrations of 12.5-100 mg/ml for vancomycin and teicoplanin, 1-8 mg/ml for mupirocin and 0.125-8 mg/ml for imipenem, with exposure times of 5, 30  and 60 min. cytotoxicity was as follows: imipenem < mupirocin < vancomycin < or = teicoplanin. resistance to methicillin-resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis for imipenem and resistance to s. epidermidis and cytotoxicity for teicoplanin limit  their consideration for suspected gram-positive keratitis. on the other hand, vancomycin and mupirocin, because of their excellent therapeutic indices, should  be considered for this indication.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == combination antibiotic supplementation of corneal storage medium.
AB  == gram-positive cocci frequently contaminate donor corneal tissue and represent the most common cause of postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis. although gentamicin is currently added to corneal storage medium in an effort to decrease bacterial contamination of donor tissue, it has poor or variable in vitro activity against  many strains of streptococci and staphylococci. to investigate whether the antibiotic supplementation of corneal storage media could be improved, we surveyed 11 antibiotics for antimicrobial efficacy under simulated storage conditions against gentamicin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and st. viridans. all antibiotics showed markedly reduced activity at 4 c as compared to their predicted activity at 37 c. bactericidal activity of streptomycin and tobramycin was enhanced by preceding 4  c storage with a three-hour period at room temperature (23 c). under these conditions, streptomycin showed the best antimicrobial activity of the 11 antibiotics tested. addition of gentamicin to streptomycin resulted in further improvement of activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, whereas the addition of penicillin g to streptomycin enhanced the activity against st. viridans. optimal antibiotic activity (99% or more killing) against all four isolates of gentamicin-resistant gram-positive cocci was best achieved with the combination of gentamicin, streptomycin, and penicillin g, coupled with a three-hour period at room temperature before 4 c storage.

AB  == macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. to evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at ph of 7.2. clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. methicillin-susceptible s aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and  erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against e coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus s pneumoniae. the gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against k pneumoniae and e coli. these results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible s aureus, k  pneumoniae, and e coli. prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

AB  == fk037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. in murine systemic infections, fk037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa). it was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae, except serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except mrsa and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was more  effective than cefpirome. these results correlated well with its in vitro activity. in murine local infections, with few exceptions, fk037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against klebsiella pneumonia in ed50 values and against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with staphylococcus epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with s. aureus and e. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. it is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of fk037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its  in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and p. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. in addition, the therapeutic effects of fk037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to mssa, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for mssa, 0.063 to 0.125 g for k. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for p. aeruginosa). fk037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect  (pae) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with mssa in neutropenic mice. these results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

AB  == thirty two cases of endophthalmitis following extracapsular cataract surgery that had occurred within our department and had undergone intraocular diagnostic tap between may 1982 and may 1991 were reviewed. an infectious agent was identified in 20 cases (62.5%). the commonest organism was staphylococcus epidermidis (11 cases) (55%). proteus was the only gram negative organism identified (four cases) (20%). both of these organisms were associated with a favourable visual outcome.  in the culture positive subgroup 15 eyes (75%) achieved a final acuity of 6/60 or better with 10 eyes (50%) gaining 6/12 or better. thirteen (65%) of the culture positive cases were managed without vitreal intervention. of these 11 (85%) achieved 6/60 or better with eight (62%) gaining 6/12 or better. it appears that  when an endophthalmitis follows uncomplicated extracapsular cataract surgery delivery of antibiotic by the 'conventional' routes (topical, subconjunctival and systemic) is consistent with a favourable visual result in many cases. a modified anterior chamber diagnostic tap technique is described.

TI  == comparative efficacy of contact lens disinfection solutions.

AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

TI  == cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), klebsiella spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., and salmonella spp.  this antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter spp., and morganella morganii. cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group a, b, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 less than 0.015 mg/l). the mics of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with mics below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  == cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and  negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefcanel had excellent activity against  methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, mic90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. however, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, mic greater than or equal to  16 micrograms/ml. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the mics were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for bacteroides spp. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the mics of cefixime. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and  50% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were resistant. cefcanel was hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-3 and moraxella bro-1 beta-lactamases. escherichia coli  containing tem-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel mics of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited haemophilus influenzae carrying tem-1.

TI  == antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  == the major pathogens causing acute otitis media (aom) are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, with moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. the same organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. in chronic suppurative otitis media, pseudomonas aeruginosa and s aureus are most frequently found. antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating aom are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. currently, about 20% of aom cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually h influenzae or m catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in aom  than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.

TI  == results of bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures from adult sickle cell disease patients with the acute chest syndrome.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of the acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease based on bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures and to describe the clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic features of the acute chest syndrome in a series composed entirely of adult patients with sickle cell disease. patients and methods: we reviewed the hospital records from 19 episodes  (18 patients) of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease  (greater than or equal to 19 years of age) who had undergone flexible bronchoscopy to obtain lower airway cultures between january 1979 and july 1987.  we also recorded patients' clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic characteristics. results: pneumonia was diagnosed in four of 19 episodes (21%) of acute chest syndrome based on quantitative cultures obtained at bronchoscopy. the pneumonia was caused by streptococcus pneumoniae in two patients and mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the other two patients. forty-four of 45 blood cultures were negative, and one grew staphylococcus epidermidis, which was considered a contaminant. chest roentgenograms revealed lower lobe involvement in 17 episodes (90%) and bilateral infiltrates in six (32%). pleural effusions occurred in seven episodes (37%), and pleural fluid samples obtained from five of these revealed sterile exudates. conclusion: the results of this retrospective study suggest that bacterial pneumonia is an uncommon cause of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease. these results are consistent with previous retrospective studies using noninvasive techniques to diagnose pneumonia. nevertheless, there appeared to be no reliable noninvasive variables that could accurately differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia and, consequently, we recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in addition to usual supportive care of these patients.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == postoperative endophthalmitis in children following cataract surgery.
AB  == three children developed endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. each had signs and symptoms of either nasolacrimal duct obstruction or upper respiratory infection at the time of surgery. the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. final visual acuities were 6/24, lp, and nlp, respectively. endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in infants has never been reported. these three cases drawn from two pediatric ophthalmology practices represent an incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis of 0.45%. although this incidence report is potentially spurious, it indicates that postoperative endophthalmitis is a very real threat in infants. we recommend a thorough systems review and exam of upper airways and lacrimal system before undertaking intraocular surgery in young children. we also caution  against simultaneous bilateral surgery.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. for comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. when tested against a higher inoculum or using the  broth dilution technique, the activity of bay v 3522 showed little dependence on  inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. clinical studies are thus warranted.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of minocycline (mino) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the mino disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the usa and europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. in this study, mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. mic80 values of mino against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. those against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic80 values against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. the inhibition zones obtained with  the disc method were compared with mics. the results of mino disc susceptibility  test either with 200 micrograms disc (showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values proposed are ( ) mic less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. the disc results of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results.  changing the lower 2 mic break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were  reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. the false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == acute mastoiditis: clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic aspects.
AB  == the charts of 73 children (31 girls, 42 boys) aged 4 months to 14 years (mean 4.5 years) with acute mastoiditis managed during a 16-year period were reviewed. of the patients 36% were less than 24 months old. retro-auricular swelling was described in 63 of the 73 children, tenderness in 59, erythema in 58, and protrusion of the auricle in 45. a pathological tympanic membrane was noted in 33% of the patients and fever in only 29%. apart from local inflammation, the most frequent complaints and symptoms were otalgia (n = 42), recent upper respiratory tract infections (n = 22), and fever alone (n = 22). a subperiosteal  abscess was found in 36 patients, and cns involvement in 5. nearly half of the patients (48%) were on antibiotic therapy at admission. the isolation rates in bacterial cultures from subperiosteal aspirated (81%) and from mastoid mucosa (68%) were considerably higher than from blood cultures (14%) and were not influenced by previously administered antibiotics. pneumococci (9/32) and staphylococcus epidermidis (6/32) were the agents most often isolated. the incidence of the bacteria isolated from patients pre-treated with antibiotics differed from the incidence in patients not previously treated. in 24 patients (33%) the lesion healed with antibiotic therapy without mastoid surgery. myringotomy and the insertion of a ventilation tube is indicated initially, if acute otitis media with effusion is found. in the absence of a subperiosteal abscess and of cns involvement, a 48-hour trial of intravenous antibiotic therapy, directed also against staphylococci, is justified before mastoid surgery is considered.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, win 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

TI  == abnormal maxillary sinus radiographs in children: do they represent bacterial infection?
AB  == thirty-three children with chronic tonsillitis and/or adenoid enlargement and without previous diagnosis of sinusitis were studied regarding the bacterial flora of their maxillary sinuses. puncture of maxillary sinus was performed at surgery (adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy) and aspirates were cultured. streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 8 of 12 (66.7%) patients whose x-rays  showed completely opacified maxillary sinus. streptococcus viridans, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from 6 (28.6%) of the 21 patients with normal maxillary sinus radiographs. bacterial titers were greater than 10(4) colonies/ml in all but one of the positive cultures. no anaerobic bacteria were isolated. history of bronchial asthma, presence of nasal purulent secretion, elevated blood eosinophils, and elevated serum ige were found more frequently in children with complete opacification of maxillary sinus. serum levels of igg2 were low in 29% of the children, but no correlation was found between low igg2 levels and positive cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. we concluded that children with complete radiologic opacification of maxillary sinus had bacterial infection in almost 70% of the cases with symptoms that did not prompt their physicians to consider the diagnosis of sinusitis.

TI  == clinical management of orbital cellulitis in children.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out by the department of ophthalmology and the division of infectious disease at the children's hospital of eastern ontario to assess the outcome of our medical management of orbital cellulitis in children using a predetermined antibiotic regimen and to determine whether computed tomographic (ct) evidence of a subperiosteal abscess alone was an indication for  surgical drainage. between february 1985 and january 1988, 23 patients with true  orbital cellulitis were admitted. ct scans were ordered routinely at the time of  admission. the scans were cancelled for 13 children because they responded rapidly to medical management. ct showed edema nasal to the medial rectus, or thickening or displacement of the muscle in 8 of the 10 children who underwent the procedure. three children required sinus and orbital drainage, but frank purulent material was found subperiosteally in only one. the results suggest that most children with orbital cellulitis can be managed with the prompt use of the appropriate intravenous antibiotics. therapy with cloxacillin sodium and chloramphenicol or, in children under age 6 years, cefuroxime best covers the spectrum of organisms responsible for most cases of orbital cellulitis in children. ct should be used as an ancillary guide to the need for surgical exploration of the orbit in patients who do not rapidly respond to medical management.

AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the comparative in vitro activity of ofloxacin and selected ophthalmic antimicrobial agents against ocular bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone anti-infective agent, was evaluated against 419 ocular bacterial isolates of 55 species to determine its potential as a topical agent for the treatment of ocular infections. other agents tested in this study, in which a modified tube-dilution procedure was used, include norfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin b. ofloxacin demonstrated good to excellent activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of all bacterial strains tested (mic90) of ofloxacin was 0.5 microgram/ml for staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis, 2 micrograms/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa. these species were more susceptible to ofloxacin than to any of the nonquinolones tested. the mic90 of ofloxacin was lower than that of norfloxacin, another quinolone, against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and st. pneumoniae and equal to that of norfloxacin against p. aeruginosa. because of its broad spectrum of activity and excellent in vitro activity, we concluded that ofloxacin has the potential for development into a superior topical treatment for ocular infection.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. since cpdx demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such gram-negative bacilli as escherichia coli, salmonella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., such gram-positive cocci as streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were  taken into account. 2. when changes in blood and urine concentrations of cpdx following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, cmax and t1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73  hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with cpdx-pr, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, b. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, e. coli and salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. an eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). as for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in got and gpt were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. in addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. based on these results, it appeared that cpdx-pr was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day  at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. significant inhibitory effect was noted against gram positive bacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. citreus, streptococcus pyogenes and sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against s. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. lactis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, c. hofmannii and bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. the inhibitory effect of julifloricine on gram negative bacteria such as the species of salmonella, shigella, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas, enterobacter, aeromonas and vibrio was almost insignificant. julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against c. tropicalis and responded equally to c. albicans. as compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both c. albicans and c. tropicalis. this alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which  included herpes simplex 1 and newcastle disease virus. julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.

AB  == the bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x mic)  and suprainhibitory (4 x mic) concentrations. five strains each of the following  microorganisms were studied: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by mics. however, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x mic and 4 x mic were tested. for many of  the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. the low mics seen for the gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x mic were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus in otitis media with effusion.
AB  == bacteriologic investigation of middle ear effusion (mee), external ear canal, and the nasopharynx was carried out on 458 patients with otitis media with effusion.  staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common bacteria in mee, even after excluding the contaminants from the external ear canal, which had the same value  of minimal inhibitory concentration as the paired mee. the bacterial agreement of s epidermidis between mee and the nasopharynx was extremely rare in contrast with haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and branhamella catarrhalis, although the organism was also frequently isolated from the nasopharynx. staphylococcus aureus, having the same minimal inhibitory concentration as that in the nasopharynx, was more frequently found in mee than s epidermidis. the results suggest that s epidermidis found in mee is not a pathogen, but rather a contaminant in many instances. staphylococcus aureus seems to be a causative agent in otitis media with effusion.

TI  == serous otitis media (s.o.m.). a bacteriological study of the ear canal and the middle ear.
AB  == a bacteriological study of the middle-ear effusions and the ear canals in children with chronic serous otitis media (s.o.m.) was performed. sixty-eight children (127 ears) were investigated. from this study it appeared that cleansing of the ear canal with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol for 30 s is partially effective; micro-organisms (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis) could still  be isolated in 29%. cleansing of the ear canal decreases the incidence of middle-ear fluid contamination by non-pathogenic ear canal organisms (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis, aerococcus), but after cleansing, 'non-pathogenic' micro-organisms could still be isolated in 33% of the effusions  (diptheroids, staphylococcus epidermidis). from 12% of the middle-ear effusions pathogenic micro-organisms (hemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus pneumoniae) were isolated; cleansing of the ear canal did not influence this percentage. anaerobics were not isolated from the middle-ear effusions.

TI  == bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  == bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. the authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from january 1983 to march 1986 at the king khaled eye  specialist hospital, riyadh, saudia arabia. all patients were followed for at least 6 months. clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. the causative organisms among those patients included: streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). in addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (p less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (p less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (p less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (p less than 0.0001). the authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefpirome (hr810).
AB  == sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and  joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were escherichia coli (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and haemophilus influenzae (1). one patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. in wound cultures, three strains of staphylococcus aureus and one each of ps. aeruginosa and str. faecalis persisted. one enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. of isolated strains, only str. faecalis and methicillin resistant staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. adverse  effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). tolerance was good. cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of me1207, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == me1207 (pivaloyloxymethyl ester of me1206) is a new oral cephalosporin. me1206 is (6r,7r)-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)- acetamido]-3-[(z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-ethyl]-cephem-4-carboxy lic acid. the  susceptibilities of about 1,600 clinical isolates to me1206 were determined by the agar dilution method. me1206 showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. me1206 was more active than cefaclor, t-2525, and cefixime against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of me1206 was comparable with that of t-2525, but me1206 was less active than cefixime. against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, me1206 had high activity (mic, less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml). me1206 was stable against various beta-lactamases, except beta-lactamases from providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas cepacia, and escherichia coli w3630 (rms213). the 50% effective doses of me1207 after oral administration against systemic infections in mice were comparable with those of t-2588 against gram-negative bacteria and about one-fourth that of t-2588 against staphylococcus aureus smith.

TI  == structural relationships between senfolomycins and paulomycins.
AB  == senfolomycins a and b (antimicrob. agents chemother.-1965: 828-831, 1966) are two antibacterial agents with physico-chemical and biological properties similar to those of paulomycin. recent studies indicate that senfolomycin a (c29h36n2o16s, mw 700) has molecular composition and fast atom bombardment ms fragmentation pattern identical to those of paulomycin e. extensive nmr work indicates that the two antibiotics, which have been separated by hplc and tlc, differ only in the stereochemistry of the och3 group present in their respective sugar moieties. indirect evident suggests that senfolomycin b is dihydrosenfolomycin a (c29h38n2o16s, mw 702) and in this respect it is related to paulomycin f. the proposed structures for senfolomycins a and b are discussed.

AB  == revision rhinoplasty was performed in 100 patients. in most cases a complete rhinoplasty with septal reconstruction, osteotomies, wedge resection and free transplants had to be done. intranasal swabs for bacterial culture were taken pre- and postoperatively. 48 patients received three mega units of propicillin transorally for 12 days, 52 patients received a placebo. white blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and temperature were taken to indicate inflammation of the nasal region. turbid nasal secretion, reddening and swelling  of the nasal linings, and bleeding of the noninjured nasal mucosa were taken as clinical signs of infection. preoperatively staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured in 69% from the nasal cavities, staphylococcus aureus in 42%, streptococci in 24%, diphtheroids in 22% etc. (see table 1). serious infections developed in six patients (five of them without antibiotics), more localized infections in twelve patients (nine of them without antibiotics). some of the infections developed after removal of the nasal packing. in five patients with serious infections either streptococcus viridans or streptococcus pneumoniae could be cultured preoperatively. in three of five cases the streptococci were propicillin-sensitive. clinical signs and laboratory parameters were not helpful  in identifying patients with infections. we conclude that patients undergoing revision rhinosurgery should be followed carefully for at least two weeks. postoperative administration of propicillin appears to be able to prevent serious nasal infections especially if free transplants are used.

TI  == the effects of sinus bacteria on human ciliated nasal epithelium in vitro.
AB  == the mechanisms by which bacteria colonize and damage ciliated epithelium are important in understanding the pathophysiology of rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis. bacteria that have the ability to impair mucociliary clearance would be at an advantage in establishing infection of ciliated surfaces. this study investigates the effect of hemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis on the ciliary activity of normal ciliated nasal epithelium in human beings. ciliary activity of the nasal epithelium in the presence of each pathogen was assessed for more than 240  minutes with a photometric method of ciliary beat frequency (cbf) measurement. h. influenzae exerted significant effects on ciliary activity, with a 46% decrease in the cbf by 4 hours (with bacteria-containing broth) and a 32% decrease with bacteria-free filtrate. s. epidermidis decreased cbf by 44% with the bacterial broth. a sterile cell-free filtrate had no significant effect. s. pneumoniae and  b. catarrhalis had no significant effect on cbf within a 240-minute period. h. influenzae and s. epidermidis disrupted normal synchronous ciliary motion, causing adjacent cilia to beat at different rates.

TI  == management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. we evaluated the management  of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of  catheter. seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. the catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. the most common microorganisms isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group d enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms p. aeruginosa and candida albicans. based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. these findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.

(2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. a broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. in a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees c, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). median age was 7 years (2 months-16  years). in patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was  added after 48 hours. the effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. the first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. bacteria were isolated in 39 children: escherichia coli: 9, staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, staphylococcus aureus: 8, streptococcus: 6, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, haemophilus: 1, klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, proteus: 1, serratia: 1, flavobacterium: 1. in these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and  netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. all blood culture were negative after the first combination. the median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). there were no death, no superinfection. tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. we conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by middle ear macrophages.
AB  == because macrophage dysfunction has been suggested as one of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for otitis media with effusion, we have examined macrophage-bacterial interactions using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-induced middle  ear macrophages from chinchillas. our data indicate that macrophages recruited to the middle ear were functional phagocytes capable of discriminate phagocytosis and intracellular killing of eight species of bacteria associated with otitis media, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. streptococcus pneumoniae types 14 and 19f, which are associated with the highest relapse frequency in cases of acute otitis media, were the most resistant to phagocytosis. the two organisms most often involved in chronic otitis media (staphylococcus epidermidis and nontypable haemophilus influenzae), however, were among the most readily phagocytized isolates. the relative importance of macrophage function in defense  of the middle ear, therefore, may be dependent on the causative agent.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ly146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. mics of ly146032 were lowest for streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus the mics were 1 mg/l, for enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and  for enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. the activity of ly146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. time-kill studies showed ly146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly146032, a new peptolide antibiotic, was compared with  those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, imipenem, amoxicillin and erythromycin. ly146032 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-resistant isolates at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. its activity was comparable to those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. mic90s for the beta-hemolytic streptococci varied from 0.25 microgram/ml for group b streptococci to 4 micrograms/ml for some group c and f streptococci. mics for streptococcus faecalis were in the range of 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 4 micrograms/ml, compared to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 1 microgram/ml for teicoplanin. for some viridans streptococci the mics were 4 micrograms/ml, whereas streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. corynebacterium jk species were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, similar to vancomycin, and listeria monocytogenes by 4 micrograms/ml. neisseria species, haemophilus species and enteric species were not inhibited. most mbcs were within two-fold of the respective mics. after 14 days passage in sub-inhibitory concentrations of ly146032, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis showed minimal increase in mics. the activity of ly146032  was increased by adding ca2+ and was reduced in an anaerobic environment. overall, ly146032 is an extremely interesting new agent that inhibits gram-positive species.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == [treatment of neurosurgical bacterial meningitis using the combination of ceftriaxone-fosfomycin].
AB  == 16 patients with bacterial meningitis following a neurosurgical procedure were given a combination of ceftriaxone and fosfomycin. 8 microorganism were isolated: 2 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 staphylococcus aureus, 1 neisseria meningitidis,  1 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 haemophilus influenzae, 1 serratia marcescens and 1 aeromonas hydrophila. no pathogen was identified in the remaining cases. all of the isolated strains were susceptible to both antibiotics. in vitro, neither synergy nor antagonism were observed between the two antimicrobial agents. the acute infectious episode resolved in all patients. one relapse only was observed, in a patient with meningitis related to a ventricular shunt, and successfully treated by the same therapeutic schedule associated with removal of the tubing. lastly, csf concentrations of both antibiotics were assayed and found to be comparable with those reported by most author.

TI  == coumermycin: in vitro activity against 251 clinical isolates of bacteria compared with the activities of eight other antibacterial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin g and vancomycin. a total of 251 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were examined. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by an agar dilution method. clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. all the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active  against s. epidermidis than against s. aureus. the mics of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin g and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. coumermycin showed poor activity against s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and enterococci. most of the s. pneumoniae isolates had also high mics, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.

TI  == bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  == forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. there were five types of infections. infections commonly associated with a t-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with salmonella species, listeria monocytogenes, cryptococcus neoformans, and histoplasma capsulatum. infections commonly associated with a b-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, staphylococcus aureus, and mixed s. aureus and group g streptococcus. other infections occurring out of  the hospital included those with s. aureus, clostridium perfringens, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group b streptococcus. because two thirds of  the septicemias were caused by organisms other than t-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == clinical evaluation of teicoplanin for therapy of severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == teicoplanin was evaluated in 47 patients with severe infections, including 14 patients with bone infections, 11 patients with soft-tissue infections, 7 patients with endocarditis, 5 patients with pneumonia, 3 patients with septic thrombophlebitis, 3 patients with septicemia of unknown origin, and 4 patients with miscellaneous infections. overall, bacteremia was documented in 24 patients. the pathogens isolated were 35 strains of staphylococcus aureus (including 8 methicillin-resistant strains), 4 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 strains of streptococcus faecalis, 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 5 strains of other streptococci, and 1 micrococcus luteus strain. a total of 22 patients (46.8%) were clinically cured, 8 patients (17.0%) improved, 2 patients (4.3%) had relapses after initial improvement, and 15 patients (31.9%) failed to  respond. the results were better in nonbacteremic patients (19 of 23 patients [82.6%] were cured or improved) than in patients with bacteremia (12 of 24 patients [50%] were cured or improved). bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (53.2%), and superinfections were documented in 6 patients (12.8%). no major adverse effects were observed. we conclude that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent for therapy of nonbacteremic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == a bacteriological study of the middle ear and upper respiratory tract in children with chronic secretory otitis media.
AB  == middle ear effusions and swabs from the external auditory meatus, nasopharynx and anterior nares have been collected from 100 children with chronic secretory otitis media. isolates of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae were typed and in vitro sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics were determined for these species and staphylococcus aureus. positive middle ear cultures were obtained from 21 children (27 effusions). haemophilus influenzae and s. pneumoniae were the commonest organisms isolated, both from the middle ear and upper respiratory tract. when one or other of these species was isolated from the middle ear, the same organism was generally found in the upper respiratory tract, but not in the ear canal. the serotypes isolated from the different sites  were also the same. type 19 was the commonest pneumococcal serotype isolated, while type e was the commonest capsulated strain of h. influenzae. thirty-six per cent of strains of h. influenzae were resistant to penicillin and 25% of those of s. pneumoniae were resistant to trimethaprim. eighty-one per cent of isolates of  s. aureus were penicillin resistant. there was no difference in the incidence of  either s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae in the post nasal spaces of children who had had their adenoids removed and those who had not.

AB  == isolates were obtained from 169 middle ear aspirates of 148 children with recently treated acute otitis media (rtom) and from 123 aspirates of 84 children  with previously untreated acute otitis media (uom). in rtom streptococcus pneumoniae and group a streptococcus (p less than 0.02) were recovered less frequently whereas staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.001) and haemophilus influenzae (p less than 0.02) were recovered more frequently than in uom. patients with rtom had more beta-lactamase-producing organisms and multiple isolates. bilateral sterile aspirates were more common in rtom although bilateral otitis media was more common in uom. in rtom most branhamella catarrhalis isolates were co-pathogens whereas staphylococcus epidermidis were always isolated in pure culture. amoxicillin was the antimicrobial most frequently (83.9%) received for the recently treated episode of otitis media. in rtom 62.4%  of isolates were susceptible to previously prescribed antibiotics, suggesting that factors other than antimicrobial susceptibility are also important in the occurrence of rtom.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == cefotaxime monotherapy of bacterial meningitis caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == primary meningitis in children is caused by two gram-negative bacterial species,  neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae, and one gram-positive bacterial species streptococcus pneumoniae. despite optimal penicillin susceptibility, with few exceptions, therapeutic results in pneumococcal meningitis are by far worse than with the other two pathogens. therefore, and because of the detection of penicillin-resistant rods, the study of alternatives  in therapy is justified and was started with cefotaxime. including six of our own patients, there are reports on 87 patients in the literature suffering from s. pneumoniae meningitis who were treated with cefotaxime monotherapy. results of these studies will be analyzed. as none of these patients belonged to a prospective controlled study group, final evaluation in comparison with penicillin therapy remains open. there are also several reports on successful treatment of group b streptococcus meningitis with cefotaxime, although there is  no need to abandon penicillin therapy. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis, usually secondary in shunted hydrocephalus, brain tumors, brain injury or other causes, should not be treated with cefotaxime because of its limited activity on these bacteria. listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus  faecalis are primarily cefotaxime-resistant, and neonatal meningitis of unknown origin, therefore, should not be treated with cefotaxime alone as long as these pathogens cannot be excluded.

TI  == an overview of cefotaxime therapy in infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and other third-generation cephalosporins against gram-positive pathogens is generally considered to be less than that of earlier cephalosporins, such as cefazolin. a review of pooled pre-release data collected by numerous investigators and supplied by hoechst-roussel made it possible to evaluate the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of cefotaxime in more than 900 infections caused by gram-positive organisms. the most commonly isolated pre-treatment organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococcal species. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 95% and the bacteriologic eradication rate was 94.5%. side-effects were limited to rash in two, diarrhea in one and fever in one. pain at the administration site was reported by four patients. comparative studies with cefazolin against s. aureus showed no statistically significant differences in efficacy. the highest failure rates were seen in enterococcal urinary tract infections, as predicted by in vitro sensitivity tests. cefotaxime  appears to be a safe, effective antibiotic for the therapy of infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == one potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. between july 1, 1981, and march 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean,  elective arterial reconstructive procedures. control cultures were obtained from  adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0  of 20) (p less than 0.001). the most common organism cultured was staphylococcus  epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). our overall graft infection rate since january 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). all three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). these patients with culture-positive graft infections  were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with  negative arterial cultures. positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). these data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.

AB  == because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the automicrobic system gram-positive identification (ams-gpi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the ams-gpi card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. we compared direct identification by the ams-gpi card with the final ams-gpi card identification and with our standard identification methods. we evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. the isolates included streptococcus pneumoniae (17), streptococcus pyogenes (13), group d enterococci (12), streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), staphylococcus aureus (15), and listeria monocytogenes (1). the ams-gpi card identified all of the group d enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae isolates. l. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. however, the ams-gpi card identified only 12 of 17 streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. we therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the ams-gpi card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

AB  == optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. we studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in  the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double  blind comparative trial. infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included streptococcus pneumoniae (14), haemophilus influenzae type b (5), h. influenzae nontypeable (3), staphylococcus aureus (4),  branhamella sp. (2), and streptococcus pyogenes (1). nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and streptococcus viridans. two aspirates were sterile. a satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of  19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. we conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.

AB  == during a 9-day period in august 1980 in a new jersey hospital, three pairs of consecutively numbered blood cultures from different patients were identified as  positive for the same organism (two pairs of klebsiella pneumoniae and one pair of group a streptococcus), for each pair, both cultures were positive in the same atmosphere, both organisms had the same sensitivities, and the second of each pair grew at least 2 days after the first and was the only positive blood culture obtained from the patient. when the hospital laboratory discontinued use of its radiometric culture analyzer for 15 days, no more consecutive pairs of positive cultures occurred. subsequent use of the machine for 9 days with a new power unit but the original circuit boards resulted in one more similar consecutive pair (staphylococcus epidermidis). after replacement of the entire power unit, there were no further such pairs. examination of the machine by the manufacturer revealed a defective circuit board which resulted in inadequate needle sterilization. laboratories which utilize radiometric analyzers should be aware of the potential for cross contamination. recognition of such events requires alert microbiologists and infection control practitioners and a record system in  the bacteriology laboratory designed to identify such clusters.

AB  == the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with  the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. n-formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. it inhibited methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited listeria. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, serratia, indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. there was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater  than the minimal inhibitory concentration. n-formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against s. aureus, s. faecalis, and many pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae. it was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of s. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less  than 0.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less  active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. presence of serum, alteration of ph, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels.  bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some enterobacter, proteus, and bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.

AB  == the growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (s epidermidis) were compared using csf, trypticase soy broth (tsb), and a phosphate buffer. each grew less in csf than in tsb. escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between csf and tsb at 24 hours of growth, whereas s epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. the differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for e. coli. similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. the non-support of bacterial growth by csf may constitute a host defense  mechanism. the basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the csf.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

AB  == thirteen children with meningitis due to haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile csf; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). a further child with meningitis caused by e. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. the agent was well tolerated. csf levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.

TI  == quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  == a widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, triton x-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. we determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. the shortest-lived was streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. all of the others (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, and  klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. k. pneumoniae, the  only gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.

TI  == quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  == quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were  counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. these plates were incubated at 37 degrees c overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. after this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. these plates were incubated again at 37 degrees c overnight. the minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. the lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. when compared for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia  marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.

TI  == bacterial stimulation and granulocyte inhibition of granulopoietic factor production.
AB  == we attempted to determine the effect of live bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis) on granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (monocytes and lymphocytes) in vitro. addition of bacteria to mononuclear-cell cultures enhanced colony-stimulating-factor production by these cells, as assayed on both human and mouse bone marrow. addition of peripheral blood granulocytes to parallel cultures eliminated this enhancement effect, presumably by bacterial removal or inactivation. these data suggest that micro-organisms may have a pivotal role in granulocyte production and maturation by serving as a stimulus to increase colony-stimulating-factor production and also as negative control through their removal by the newly formed granulocytes.

TI  == secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  == inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis. lipid  secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. this novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: s. sanguis (group h), s. pyogenes (group a), and s. pneumoniae. the secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. the occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating  with resumption of culture growth. all cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. it  is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.

TI  == lung bacterial clearance in murine pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  == we studied the bactericidal capacity of the rat lung during the development of pneumococcal pneumonia. pneumonia was produced in a lower lobe by the intrabronchial instillation of 10(4)streptococcus pneumoniae cells in buffer. lung bacterial counts progressively increased, reaching 10(7) per lung within 48  h, and the increase was associated with localized atelectasis and consolidation.  bacterial multiplication was inhibited with tetracycline at various intervals after infection, and the subsequent clearance of pneumococci was determined. viable pneumococci were rapidly killed by lung defenses if bacterial multiplication was inhibited within 12 h of the onset of infection. no change occurred in the bacterial populationif tetracycline was delayed until 24 h after  infection, indicating that pneumococcal killing by lung defenses had ceased. this effect could be reproduced with the addition of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide to the inoculum, which produced a dose-related inhibition of pneumococcal clearance. the clearance of s. epidermidis was not impaired in the presence of pneumococcal pneumonia or by administration of exogenous capsular polysaccharide. these data indicate that pneumococcal pneumonia causes a marked impairment in lung antipneumococcal defenses within 24 h of the onset of infection. this acquired defect in antibacterial defenses may be due to the accumulation of pneumococcal capsular material in the lungs of infected animals.

AB  == the microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the hopital cantonal, geneva, between august 1970 and october 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. the pathogenic role of s. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. when defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured  cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. an unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main  therapeutic problem. thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. this clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.

AB  == peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. the pyrogenic response of rabbit to group a streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or tca is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. the pyrogenicity  can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of  the material by lysozyme. peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group b and  l streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group a streptococcus peptidoglycan. spirillum serpens and escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to s. aureus and group a streptococcus peptidoglycans. intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages  of the degenerative and necrotic process. local shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. the results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. these properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. the data presented suggest the role  of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
