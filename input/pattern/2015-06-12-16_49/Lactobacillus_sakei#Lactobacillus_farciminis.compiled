TI  - Combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  - In this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in sucuk a Turkish fermented dry sausage. On the one hand, the PCR-DGGE method targetting the V1 and V3 regions of 16S DNA was applied to DNA that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. On the other hand, rep-PCR fingerprinting was performed for the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region. As a result of the PCR-DGGE analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. The culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the Lactobacillus genera including Lb. sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. curvatus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus farciminis and Lactobacillus alimentarius. However, Leuconostoc and Weisella were also detected as minor genera. Again, Lactococcus piscium, Weissella halotolerans, Staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated Staphylococcus piscifermentans/Staphylococcus condimenti/Staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while Lb. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. In the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of LAB communities in fermented food products.
TI  - In vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. The selected bacteria include strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus farciminis, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Viable counts after simulated gastric transit tolerance showed that L. reuteri strains and P. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas L. pentosus, L. farciminis and L. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. All strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. The bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. Overall, L. plantarum MF1298 and three L. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. All strains, both living and UV-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function. However, living L. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) from 6 to 24h. This work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. Overall, L. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.
TI  - Identification of potential probiotic starter cultures for Scandinavian-type fermented sausages.
AB  - Potential probiotic cultures suitable as starter cultures for the Scandinavian-type fermented sausages were identified among strains well-adapted to fermented meats as well as strains originating from a culture collection. From 15 different fermented meat products, 22 strains were isolated as dominant non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB). The isolates were identified by RAPD, API and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and showed to be five strains of Lactobacillus sakei, five strains of Lactobacillus farciminis, five strains belonging to the group of Lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, four strains of Lactobacillus alimentarius, two strains of Lactobacillus brevis and one strain of Lactobacillus versmoldensis. Heterofermentative strains as well as strains not growing at 37 degrees C and not lowering pH below 5.1 in a meat model were excluded leaving 9 strains for further studies. These strains together with 19 strains from a culture collection were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to pH 2.5 or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. Strains that fulfilled all the probiotic criteria and showed to be fast acid producers in a meat model included three strains belonging to the group of Lb. plantarum/pentosus (MF1291, MF1298, MF1300) which originated from the dominant NSLAB of fermented meat products. MF1291 and MF 1298 were further identified as Lb. plantarum and MF1300 as Lb. pentosus. The three strains were all successfully applied as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausage. The viable count at the end of the processing period reached high cell numbers (4.7x10(7)-2.9x10(8) cfu/g) and pH of the sausages decreased to pH 4.8-4.9 without any flavour deviation compared to sausage fermented by a commercial meat starter culture.
TI  - Characterisation of lab in typical Salento Pecorino cheese.
AB  - Twenty-nine strains of Lactic Acid Bacteria isolated from the typical Pecorino cheese of the Salento area of Italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. A preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. For the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene was employed In addition, restriction analysis of amplified rDNA (ARDRA) and PCR and AFLP fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated UPGMA cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. The data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of Pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. The main identified strains were Lactobacillus brevis, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. sakei, L. pentosus, L. farciminis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus farciminis with 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region polymorphism and PCR amplification using species-specific oligonucleotide.
AB  - AIMS: The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used to differentiate Lactobacillus species having closely related identities in the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR). Species-specific primers for Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius were designed and allowed rapid identification of these species. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 16S-23S rDNA spacer region was amplified by primers tAla and 23S/p10, then digested by HinfI and TaqI enzymes and analysed by electrophoresis. Digestion by HinfI was not sufficient to differentiate Lact. sakei, Lact. curvatus, Lact. farciminis, Lact. alimentarius, Lact. plantarum and Lact. paraplantarum. In contrast, digestion carried out by TaqI revealed five different patterns allowing these species to be distinguished, except for Lact. plantarum from Lact. paraplantarum. The 16S-23S rDNA spacer region of Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius were amplified and then cloned into vector pCR(R)2.1 and sequenced. The DNA sequences obtained were analysed and species-specific primers were designed from these sequences. The specificity of these primers was positively demonstrated as no response was obtained for 14 other species tested. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The species-specific primers for Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius were shown to be useful for identifying these species among other lactobacilli. The RFLP profile obtained upon digestion with HinfI and TaqI enzymes can be used to discriminate Lact. farciminis, Lact. alimentarius, Lact. sakei, Lact. curvatus and Lact. plantarum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this paper, we have established the first species-specific primer for PCR identification of Lact. farciminis and Lact. alimentarius. Both species-specific primer and RFLP, could be used as tools for rapid identification of lactobacilli up to species level.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
