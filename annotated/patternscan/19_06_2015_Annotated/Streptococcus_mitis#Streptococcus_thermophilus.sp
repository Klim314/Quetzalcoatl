TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == study of the intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility of partial single base c-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and its applicability for the identification of members of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the use of single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene (sbcs) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of reference strains of 30 different species within the genus streptococcus. for sbcs, only dd-ctp's are used in the sequencing reactions instead of the four dideoxy bases and the primer is fluorescently labeled. the reproducibility, interlaboratory exchangeability and discriminative power of this method were studied by comparing the patterns obtained in three laboratories under highly standardized conditions. the interlaboratory reproducibility proved  to be high, enabling the construction of a common database for the identification of strains belonging to the streptococcal species studied. most of the examined species generated distinguishable profiles. sbcs did not differentiate between the closely related species s. constellatus and s. intermedius. also s. thermophilus and s. vestibularis as well as s. mitis and s. pneumoniae showed highly resembling profiles. the previously reported heterogeneity within the species s. equinus was reflected by sbcs. for all other species, strains belonging to the same species generated indistinguishable patterns. in conclusion, single base c-sequencing of the first 500 bases of the 16s rrna-gene  could be a useful and widely applicable method for the identification of bacteria at the species level, with the added advantage of being more rapid and easier to  automatize than full sequence determination.

TI  == application and evaluation of the interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) for identification of streptococcus species.
AB  == the discriminatory power, speed, and interlaboratory reproducibility of trna intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tdna-pcr) combined with capillary electrophoresis was evaluated for the identification of streptococci. this method was carried out in three different laboratories under highly standardized conditions for 54 strains belonging to 18 different species. it was concluded that interlaboratory reproducibility of tdna fingerprints produced by means of capillary electrophoresis was sufficiently high to permit the exchange between different laboratories and the construction of common libraries which can be consulted for comparison with fingerprints obtained independently in separate laboratories. in a second step, 17 other species were included in the study and examined in one of the participating laboratories. all streptococcus species studied, except s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis, showed distinguishable tdna fingerprints. a database of well-characterized strains was constructed to enable computer-aided identification of unknown streptococcal isolates.

TI  == genetic loci of streptococcus mitis that mediate binding to human platelets.
AB  == the direct binding of bacteria to platelets is a postulated major interaction in  the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. to identify bacterial components that mediate platelet binding by streptococcus mitis, we screened a tn916deltae-derived mutant library of s. mitis strain sf100 for reduced binding to human platelets in vitro. two distinct loci were found to affect platelet binding. the first contains a gene (pblt) encoding a highly hydrophobic, 43-kda protein with 12 potential membrane-spanning segments. this protein resembles members of the major facilitator superfamily of small-molecule transporters. the  second platelet binding locus consists of an apparent polycistronic operon. this  region includes genes that are highly similar to those of lactococcus lactis phage r1t and streptococcus thermophilus phage 01205. two genes (pbla and pblb) encoding large surface proteins are also present. the former encodes a 107-kda protein containing tryptophan-rich repeats, which may serve to anchor the protein within the cell wall. the latter encodes a 121-kda protein most similar to a tail fiber protein from phage 01205. functional mapping by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and gene complementation indicates that pblb may be a platelet adhesin and that expression of pblb may be linked to that of pbla. the combined data indicate that at least two genomic regions contribute to platelet binding by s. mitis. one encodes a probable transmembrane transporter, while the second encodes two large surface proteins resembling structural components of lysogenic  phages.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
