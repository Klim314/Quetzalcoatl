TI  == the rising tide of bloodstream infections with actinomyces species: bimicrobial infection with actinomyces odontolyticus and escherichia coli in an intravenous drug user.
AB  == clinicians of all specialties need to be aware of a recent, nationwide increase in the number of actinomyces bloodstream infections. we report a case of bimicrobial bloodstream infection with actinomyces odontolyticus and escherichia  coli in an intravenous drug user. a 36-year-old, male intravenous drug user was admitted with acute-onset pleuritic chest pain, back pain, pyrexia, tachycardia,  tachypnoea and hypotension. chest ct showed multiple, bilateral, cavitating lung  lesions, most likely the result of septic emboli originating from an infected deep venous thrombosis (dvt). blood cultures led to a mixed growth of a. odontolyticus, identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof), and e. coli. the rising tide of bloodstream infections with actinomyces species is likely to continue with the increasing availability of sophisticated molecular identification techniques, including maldi-tof. in this case, the results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were particularly important because the e. coli was susceptible to ciprofloxacin, whereas the a. odontolyticus was resistant.

TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota of people in france and saudi arabia.
AB  == background/objectives: the gut microbiota contributes to energy acquisition from  food, and changes in the gut microbiome are associated with obesity. the eating habits of saudis are much different than those of europeans, and our objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of obese and normal weight saudis and french. subjects/methods: illumina miseq deep sequencing was used to test the gut microbiota of 9 normal weight and 9 obese individuals from saudi arabia and 16 normal weight and 12 obese individuals from france. results: obese french possessed significantly more relative proteobacteria (p=0.002) and bacteroidetes  (p=0.05) and had lower richness and biodiversity at all the operational taxonomic unit (otu) cutoffs (p<0.05) than normal weight french. obese saudis possessed significantly more firmicutes (p=0.001) without a difference in richness (p=0.2)  and biodiversity (p=0.3) compared with normal weight saudis. we found a common bacterial species core of 23 species existing in 50% of obese and normal weight saudis and 29 species in 50% of obese and normal weight french. actinomyces odontolyticus, escherichia coli and ruminococcus obeum were present in at least 50% of all individuals tested. french individuals had significantly higher richness and biodiversity compared with saudis at all the otu cutoffs (p<0.05). conclusion: microbiota differences between obese and normal weight french were not similar to those between obese and normal weight saudis. the studies of different populations can result in contrasting data regarding the associations of the gut microbiota and obesity.

TI  == one-step high-efficiency crispr/cas9-mediated genome editing in streptomyces.
AB  == the rna-guided dna editing technology crisprs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/cas9 had been used to introduce double-stranded breaks into genomes and to direct subsequent site-specific insertions/deletions or the replacement of genetic material in bacteria, such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumonia, and lactobacillus reuteri. in this study, we established a high-efficiency crispr/cas9 genome editing plasmid pkccas9do for use in streptomyces genetic manipulation, which comprises a target-specific guide rna, a codon-optimized cas9, and two homology-directed repair templates. by delivering pkccas9do series editing plasmids into the model strain streptomyces coelicolor m145, through one-step intergeneric transfer, we achieved the genome editing at different levels with high efficiencies of 60%-100%, including single gene deletion, such as actii-orf4, redd, and glnr, and single large-size gene cluster  deletion, such as the antibiotic biosynthetic clusters of actinorhodin (act) (21.3 kb), undecylprodigiosin (red) (31.6 kb), and ca(2+)-dependent antibiotic (82.8 kb). furthermore, we also realized simultaneous deletions of actii-orf4 and redd, and of the act and red biosynthetic gene clusters with high efficiencies of 54% and 45%, respectively. finally, we applied this system to introduce nucleotide point mutations into the rpsl gene, which conferred the mutants with resistance to streptomycin. notably, using this system, the time required for one round of genome modification is reduced by one-third or one-half of those for conventional methods. these results clearly indicate that the established crispr/cas9 genome editing system substantially improves the genome editing efficiency compared with the currently existing methods in streptomyces, and it has promise for application to genome modification in other actinomyces species.

TI  == [isolation and identification of termitarium antagonistic actinomycetes byc 01 and its active metabolites].
AB  == objective: we isolated actinomyces from the termitarium and studied its metabolites to find the antimicrobial compounds. methods: we determined the taxonomic status of target strain byc 01 by morphological observation and 16s rrna sequence analysis. growth rate method and agar disc diffusion assays were used to test the antimicrobial activities. fermentation product was isolated and  purified by various chromatographic methods, and the structure was determined by  mass spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. results: byc 01 was identified as streptomyces violaceoruber. the main antimicrobial ingredients of byc 01 fermentation broth consisted in the ethyl acetate fraction of moderate polar part. the ethyl acetate extract of byc 01 had strong antifungal activities  against valsa mali with inhibition rate of more than 90%, and activities against  rhizoctonia solani and dothiorella gregaria with inhibition rate of more than 60% under the concentration of 100 microg/ml. furthermore, the extract showed the intermediate antimicrobial activities against candida albicans, staphyloccocus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and xanthomonas oryzae with the mean  halo diameters ranging from 11.3 to 16.5 mm under the concentration of 30 microg/filter paper. a monomer compound was purified from the fermentation products, and was identified as fogacin on the basis of mass spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. the compound fogacin and the positive control had similar antimicrobial activities against c. albicans with inhibition zone of 19.3 mm and 20.1 mm under the concentration of 30 microg/filter paper. conclusion: strain byc 01 could be potentially developed as a new antimicrobial agent.

TI  == pilus hijacking by a bacterial coaggregation factor critical for oral biofilm development.
AB  == the formation of dental plaque, a highly complex biofilm that causes gingivitis and periodontitis, requires specific adherence among many oral microbes, including the coaggregation of actinomyces oris with streptococcus oralis that helps to seed biofilm development. here, we report the discovery of a key coaggregation factor for this process. this protein, which we named coaggregation factor a (cafa), is one of 14 cell surface proteins with the lpxtg motif predicted in a. oris mg1, whose function was hitherto unknown. by systematic mutagenesis of each of these genes and phenotypic characterization, we found that the actinomyces/streptococcus coaggregation is only abolished by deletion of cafa. subsequent biochemical and cytological experiments revealed that cafa constitutes the tip of a unique form of the type 2 fimbria long known for its role in coaggregation. the direct and predominant role of cafa in adherence is evident from the fact that cafa or an antibody against cafa inhibits coaggregation, whereas the shaft protein fima or a polyclonal antibody against fima has no effect. remarkably, fima polymerization was blocked by deletion of genes for both cafa and fimb, the previously described tip protein of the type 2  fimbria. together, these results indicate that some surface proteins not linked to a pilus gene cluster in gram-positive bacteria may hijack the pilus. these unique tip proteins displayed on a common pilus shaft may serve distinct physiological functions. furthermore, the pilus shaft assembly in gram-positive bacteria may require a tip, as is true for certain gram-negative bacterial pili.

TI  == [alkaloids from gorgonian-derived streptomyces sp. scsgaa0009 and their antibacterial and antilarval activities].
AB  == objective: to search for structurally novel and biologically active compounds from the secondary metabolites of gorgonian-derived actinomyces. methods: strains of actinomyces with antimicrobial activities were screened by biological methods. then, those active strains were cultured under different conditions to obtain crude extracts. subsequently, the chemical diversities of the extracts were investigated by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc) and thin layer chromatography (tlc), while the bioactivities of the extracts were evaluated by antifouling and antibacterial assays. a target strain streptomyces sp. scsgaa0009 was selected to further study by large-scale fermentation on modified isp2 medium. the compounds were isolated by column chromatography over silica gel, sephadex lh-20, and semipreparative hplc, and their structures were determinated by spectroscopic analysis. results: the target strain was identified as actinomyces, streptomyces sp. scsgaa0009. a new alkaloid n-(2-(1h-indol-3-yl)ethyl) propionamide (1) and a known compound phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (2) were purified from the culture broth. compound 2  showed moderate antibacterial activity against escherichia coli and pseudoaltermonas piscida, and exhibited strong antilarval settlement activity towards bugula neritina larva. conclusion: bioactive and new compounds can be achieved from the secondary metabolites of gorgonian-derived microorganisms from  south china sea.

TI  == pro-oxidative synergic bactericidal effect of no: kinetics and inhibition by nitroxides.
AB  == no plays diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes, occasionally  resulting in opposing effects, particularly in cells subjected to oxidative stress. no mostly protects eukaryotes against oxidative injury, but was demonstrated to kill prokaryotes synergistically with h2o2. this could be a promising therapeutic avenue. however, recent conflicting findings were reported  describing dramatic protective activity of no. the previous studies of no effects on prokaryotes applied a transient oxidative stress while arbitrarily checking the residual bacterial viability after 30 or 60min and ignoring the process kinetics. if no-induced synergy and the oxidative stress are time-dependent, the  elucidation of the cell killing kinetics is essential, particularly for survival  curves exhibiting a "shoulder" sometimes reflecting sublethal damage as in the linear-quadratic survival models. we studied the kinetics of no synergic effects  on h2o2-induced killing of microbial pathogens. a synergic pro-oxidative activity toward gram-negative and gram-positive cells is demonstrated even at sub-mum/min  flux of no. for certain strains, the synergic effect progressively increased with the duration of cell exposure, and the linear-quadratic survival model best fit the observed survival data. in contrast to the failure of sod to affect the bactericidal process, nitroxide sod mimics abrogated the pro-oxidative synergy of no/h2o2. these cell-permeative antioxidants, which hardly react with diamagnetic  species and react neither with no nor with h2o2, can detoxify redox-active transition metals and catalytically remove intracellular superoxide and nitrogen-derived reactive species such as (*)no2 or peroxynitrite. the possible mechanism underlying the bactericidal no synergy under oxidative stress and the potential therapeutic gain are discussed.

TI  == the effects of different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate on the antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium enrich mixture.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and calcium enrich mixture) cem (mixed with different concentrations of chlorhexidine (chx). materials and methods: cements used in this in vitro study included gray proroot mta and cem with the microorganisms being entrococcus faecalis, streptococcus muntas, candida albicans, actinomyces, escherichia coli, and a mixture of these microorganisms. chx was used in the form of liquid at 0.2%, 2%, and 0.12% concentrations. contact dilution and colony count method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity  of these cements. after 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96-hour intervals, we cultured the samples on blood agar medium. colonies were counted after incubation at 37 degrees . data were statistically analyzed by a kruskal-wallis test to compare the antimicrobial activity of mta and cem. results: all concentrations of chx were mixed with mta and the cem had antibacterial activities on all microorganisms' strains except for the enterococcus faecalis and the mixture group. mta had better antibacterial activity than the cem, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.13). the mixing of mta and the cem with chx significantly increased the antibacterial properties of both cements (p < 0.03).  there was no statistically significant difference between the different concentrations of chx. the antibacterial activity of the materials increased through time. conclusion: the mixture of mta and cem with different concentration of chx significantly increased the antibacterial activity.

TI  == microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  == background: knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. objective: the objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. materials and methods: retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were  reviewed. results: cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and  the organisms included staphylococcus aureus 18, streptococci 7, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of enterobactersp, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of actinomyces israelii, diptheroids, coagulase negative staphylococcus, citrobacter freundii, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. four had polymicrobial infection. culture of purulent  nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. in 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from  the orbit and from cultures from other sites. gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. conclusion: gram-positive cocci, especially s. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. infections by gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of staphylococcal organisms and gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == novel thermostable lipase from bacillus circulans iiib153: comparison with the mesostable homologue at sequence and structure level.
AB  == thermophilic bacillus circulans iiib153 isolated from hot springs of north west himalayas, india, produced an extracellular lipase, which exhibited significant biofilm disruption property on the static biofilm disruption model with a single  species of actinomyces viscosous. the gene encoding the lipase was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. recombinant bacillus circulans lipase (bcl), a monomer with molecular mass of 43 kda also exhibited significant biofilm disruption activity. the enzyme was optimally active at 60 degrees c, ph 8.5 and  retained >70% of its original activity after 1 h incubation at 60 degrees c. 3d structure of bcl developed by homology modeling showed a typical alpha/beta hydrolase fold, a characteristic feature of lipolytic enzymes. comparison of thermostable bcl with mesostable lipase from chromobacterium viscosum at the sequence and structure level showed distinct variations in the structural features, with the presence of a high content of proline residues, aromatic amino acids and salt bridges. these features along with the presence of zinc-binding site observed in bcl structure could have a potential role in thermal stability of the enzyme.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == appendicitis: when there is more than meets the eye.
AB  == acute appendicitis is the most frequent emergency in gastrointestinal surgery. obstruction of the appendiceal lumen appears to be one of the most common physiologic mechanisms for the development of acute appendicitis. once obstructed, the dilatation of the lumen causes ischemia and necrosis of the wall. the most common organisms involved in appendicitis are escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus, bacillus fragilis and pseudomonas. rarely, actinomyces is involved in this process. in this case report, we report a case of actinomycosis  of the appendix vermiformis occurring in a 19-year-old male with no predisposing  factors. along with a review of the literature, we will define the risk factors,  clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, and treatment of actinomycosis.

TI  == primary chest wall abscess caused by escherichia coli costochondritis.
AB  == chest wall abscess may occur as primary infection or secondary to open trauma or  thoracic wall surgery. the authors describe an unusual case of escherichia coli costochondritis occurring 2 months after a blunt chest wall trauma. primary chest wall abscess due to e coli costochondritis has been previously reported only twice occurring after urinary tract infection. all other very few reports of e coli costochondritis have been reported only after thoracic surgical procedures.  an english literature review of primary chest wall abscess showed that 4 pathogens are responsible for the majority of cases: actinomyces, staphylococcus  aureus, candida albicans and salmonella. c albicans costochondritis was most commonly reported among heroin addicts. the appearance of a growing chest wall mass should always prompt a search for an infectious cause, even with little or no systemic signs and symptoms.

TI  == focal intracranial infections due to actinomyces species in immunocompetent patients: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
AB  == objective: actinomyces spp. are often underestimated as causes of central nervous system infection because they are not looked for routinely and are difficult to detect. we try to determine the optimal management of these problematic intracranial infectious diseases in neurosurgical practice. methods: five cases of intracranial suppurations due to actinomyces spp. treated between december 2007 and february 2009 are reported. the relevant clinicobacteriologic features and treatment outcomes are analyzed. results: there were two brain abscesses, two subdural empyemas, and one frontal sinus pyomucocele with intracranial extension. among them, three cases were previously operated and two patients were previously treated for otorhinolaryngeal infection. all cases were immunocompetent. in addition to actinomyces sp., three patients had coinfectious bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus warneri, and escherichia coli). complete  resolution of the infection was achieved by means of aggressive surgical treatment and relatively short course of antibiotic therapy with a full recovery. conclusion: actinomycotic focal cerebral infections may occur with greater frequency than previously recognized. polymicrobial bacteria may be seen. this rare anaerobic organism should be considered in patients with a history of head trauma, previous surgery, or otorhinolaryngeal infection who present with a long  duration of neurologic symptoms with or without an accompanying fever. patients may be candidates for surgical debridement with relative shorter term of antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin).

TI  == short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (sz) to mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta against staphylococcus aureus (atcc #25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc #29212), escherichia coli (atcc#25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc #27853), candida albicans (atcc #90028), porphyromonas gingivalis (atcc #33277), actinomyces israelii (atcc #12102), and prevotella intermedia (atcc# 15032). sz was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to mta powder. the control group was mta powder with no sz. the antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed mta specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. the amounts of silver ion release from mta specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. the ph of mta specimens was measured with a ph meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. mta with 2% and 0.2% sz specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for p. intermedia and  a. israelii. mta without sz inhibited c. albicans, e. coli, and p. intermedia. the highest silver release was detected in 2% sz mta at 24 h. the incorporation of sz may enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta.

TI  == systems-level analysis of microbial community organization through combinatorial  labeling and spectral imaging.
AB  == microbes in nature frequently function as members of complex multitaxon communities, but the structural organization of these communities at the micrometer level is poorly understood because of limitations in labeling and imaging technology. we report here a combinatorial labeling strategy coupled with spectral image acquisition and analysis that greatly expands the number of fluorescent signatures distinguishable in a single image. as an imaging proof of  principle, we first demonstrated visualization of escherichia coli labeled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) with 28 different binary combinations of eight fluorophores. as a biological proof of principle, we then applied this combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging fish (clasi-fish) strategy using genus- and family-specific probes to visualize simultaneously and differentiate 15 different phylotypes in an artificial mixture of laboratory-grown microbes. we then illustrated the utility of our method for the structural analysis of a natural microbial community, namely, human dental plaque, a microbial biofilm. we demonstrate that 15 taxa in the plaque community can be imaged simultaneously and analyzed and that this community was dominated by early colonizers, including species of streptococcus, prevotella, actinomyces, and veillonella. proximity analysis was used to determine the frequency of inter- and intrataxon cell-to-cell associations which revealed statistically significant intertaxon pairings. cells of the genera prevotella and actinomyces showed the most interspecies associations, suggesting a central role for these genera in establishing and maintaining biofilm complexity. the results provide an initial systems-level structural analysis of biofilm organization.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == a study on the pathological lesions of oviducts of buffaloes diagnosed at postmortem.
AB  == the aims of this study were to study the prevalence of oviduct abnormalities of buffaloes, investigate bacteria accompanying hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx and salpingitis. in addition, the study was designed to investigate the correlation between bacterial infection of the uterus and oviduct lesions in buffaloes. bacteriological examinations were performed on hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx and salpingitis. hydrosalpinx was found in 28 (6.9%) cases of which 20 (71.4%) were found unilaterally and 8 (28.6%) bilaterally. pyosalpinx was recorded in 12 (2.9%). three cases (0.7%) of oviducts filled with blood were recorded. obstruction of oviducts was recorded in 5 (1.2%). adhesions between mesosalpinx and perisalpingeal tissues were observed in 7 (1.7) cases. one case of double oviduct was found in the left side of the tract examined. the most prevalent bacteria recovered from hydrosalpinx were corynebacterium hemolyticum and actinomyces bovis, 42.8% and 28.6%, respectively. no correlation was noticed between bacteria isolated from the uterus and hydrosalpinx. the most prevalent bacteria recovered from pyosalpinx were escherichia coli, archanobacterium pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, 33.3%, 26.7% and 16.7%, respectively. higher  rates of leukocyte infiltration (p < 0.01) were observed in the uterine discharge and pyosalpinx than hydrosalpinx. in a conclusion, the current study disclosed that oviductal lesions seem to be an important problem in buffalo cows. in addition, there is no correlation between bacteria isolated from uterus and hydrosalpinx. there is a high correlation between bacteria isolated from uterus and pyosalpinx and salpingitis. the occurrence of pyosalpinx and salpingitis is mainly due to bacterial infection. bacterial isolates from pyosalpinx and salpingitis might be related to ascending infection from the uterus.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial efficiency of a mouthwash containing triclosan/gantrez and sodium bicarbonate.
AB  == several antiseptic substances have been used as adjuncts to routine mechanical procedures of oral hygiene, based on their antimicrobial effects. the objective of this study was to assess in vitro the antimicrobial efficiency of a mouthwash  containing triclosan/gantrez and sodium bicarbonate in comparison to both positive and negative controls. standard strain samples of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, actinomyces viscosus and bacillus subtilis were used. samples of streptococcus mutans and gram-negative bacilli were collected from 20  volunteers (10 with a clinically healthy periodontium and 10 presenting biofilm-associated gingivitis). evaluation of the antimicrobial activity was performed by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic). the results  indicated that the test solution inhibited the growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms from the volunteers saliva as well as that of the standard strains at the mic dilution of 1:20, whereas the mic dilution of 0.12% chlorhexidine against the same bacteria was 1:80. thus, even though the tested mouthrinse solution presented an in-vitro antimicrobial activity superior to that of a placebo, it was inferior to that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == activity of an antimicrobial peptide mimetic against planktonic and biofilm cultures of oral pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have recently been examined for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics. unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. to address this problem, we have examined  the activity of a peptide mimetic whose design was based on the structure of magainin, exhibiting its amphiphilic structure. we demonstrate that this compound, meta-phenylene ethynylene (mpe), exhibits antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations against a variety of bacterial and candida species found in oral infections. since streptococcus mutans, an etiological agent of dental caries, colonizes the tooth surface and forms a biofilm, we quantified the activity of this compound against s. mutans growing under conditions that favor biofilm formation. our results indicate that mpe can prevent the formation of a biofilm at nanomolar concentrations. incubation with 5 nm mpe prevents further growth of the biofilm, and 100 nm mpe reduces viable bacteria in the biofilm by 3 logs. structure-function analyses suggest that mpe inhibits the bioactivity of lipopolysaccharide and binds dna at equimolar ratios, suggesting that it may act  both as a membrane-active molecule, similar to magainin, and as an intracellular  antibiotic, similar to other amps. we conclude that mpe and similar molecules display great potential for development as therapeutic antimicrobials.

TI  == attb site disruption in marine actinomyces sp. m048 via dna transformation of a site-specific integration vector.
AB  == an efficient conjugation method has been developed for the marine actinomyces sp. isolate m048 to facilitate the genetic manipulation of the chandrananimycin biosynthesis gene cluster. a phic31-derived integration vector pij8600 containing orit and attp fragments was introduced into strain m048 by bi-parental conjugation from escherichia coli et12567 to strain m048. transformation efficiency was (6.38+/-0.41)x10(-5) exconjugants per recipient spore. analysis of eight exconjugants showed that the plasmid pij8600 was stably integrated at a single chromosomal site (attb) of the actinomyces genome. the dna sequence of the attb was cloned and shown to be conserved. the results of antimicrobial activity  analysis indicated that the insertion of plasmid pij8600 seemed to affect the biosynthesis of antibiotics that could strongly inhibit the growth of e. coli and mucor miehei (tu284). hplc-ms analysis of the extracts indicated that disruption  of the attb site resulted in the complete abolition of chandrananimycin a-c production, proving the identity of the gene cluster. instead of chandrananimycins, two bafilomycins were produced through disruption of the attb  site from the chromosomal dna of marine actinomyces sp. m048.

TI  == effects of intrauterine device and oral contraceptive on vaginal flora and epithelium.
AB  == objective: to investigate the microbial and cytopathological changes and genital  symptoms in oral contraceptive pill (ocp) and intrauterine contraceptive device (iucd) users. methods: included in the study were 34 women using ocp and 34 women using iucd for 24 to 36 months period and 34 women as control group. we conducted the study between march to september 2005 in antakya maternity hospital, turkey.  vaginal discharge was subjected to wet mount examination, gram staining, and culture. cervical smears were examined and reported using the bethesda system as  reference. results: in the iucd group, women with intermediate score was 20.6%, while those with bacterial vaginosis was 11.7%. in the ocp group however, women with intermediate score was 8.8%, while those with bacterial vaginosis was 5.9%.  compared to the control group, these rates were 2.9% for those with intermediate  score and 2.9% for those with bacterial vaginosis. escherichia coli vaginal colonization increased by 5-fold in the iucd users (p<0.05). cervical erosion was found in 14.7% of the women using iucd as compared to the other groups (p<0.05).  actinomyces like organisms was detected in 11.7% of the iucd users (p<0.05). conclusion: the use of iucd clearly alter the normal vaginal flora, although ocp  appears to have minimal effects on the vaginal microbial flora. the data support  the hypothesis that iucd might change cervico vaginal environment, and suggests that women with iucd may be at a higher risk for vulvovaginal infection.

TI  == [actinomyces odontolyticus isolation during prosthetic aortic graft infection with paraprosthetic duodenal fistula].
AB  == introduction: prosthetic vascular graft infection is a rare complication of vascular surgery. we report a case with graft enteric fistula and actinomyces odontolyticus bacteremia. exegesis: a 73 year-old man with a prosthetic aortic graft and who had a parodontal disease, has been hospitalised for fever of unknown origin. blood cultures grew with escherichia coli and actinomyces odontolyticus. the imaging studies indicated graft infection. laparotomy has confirmed the diagnosis and highlighted a polymicrobial infection and a paraprosthetic duodenal fistula. a review of the literature's data concerning prosthetic vascular graft infections is made. the role of actinomyces odontolyticus in that case is discussed. conclusion: prosthetic aortic graft infection due to graft enteric fistula is usually a polymicrobial infection and is a late complication of aortic surgery. imaging is essential for the diagnosis  of prosthetic aortic graft infection. it is possible that actinomyces odontolyticus has contributed to prosthesis infection in this case.

TI  == association between the presence of bacterial 16s rna in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (sweden).
AB  == objective: to study bacterial 16s rna in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial dna was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n =  171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). methods: 16s dna pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. results: in 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16s rna were detected.  sequence analysis revealed propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16s rna positive patients). the second most frequent isolate-escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. the other isolates included pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == development of bacterial and bifidobacterial communities in feces of newborn babies.
AB  == microbial 16s rdna from babies' fecal samples were amplified by pcr, and analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), cloning and sequencing. pcr-dgge profiles were used to follow in time the colonization of the intestine by bacteria. four healthy babies, one baby who received antibiotics and their parents participated to the present study to determine the extent to which administration of antibiotics can modify the bacterial colonization of neonatal human gut and verify the influence of parental factors on the formation of the fecal bacterial community. in the healthy babies, escherichia coli or bacteria belonging to clostridium spp. were the initial colonizers rapidly followed by bifidobacterium, bacteroides, clostridium, streptococcus, enterococcus and actinomyces. bifidobacterium species appeared already after five days in the breast-fed babies while there was a delay in the baby who received a formula based diet during only one day after birth. in each baby two or three bifidobacterial species including b. infantis were found. the observed variations in species were not associated with the feeding changes. the comparison of dgge profiles of the babies and their parents patterns showed bands with equal migration suggesting a vertical transmission determined by genetic and environmental factors. the brief appearance of pioneer bacteria determined as being e. coli and enterococcus spp. in the profile from the baby under antibiotic therapy, was succeeded by a small stable community consisting of ruminococcus species. no bifidobacterium sequences were detectable in this antibiotic-treated  baby in spite of a partly breast-milk diet.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == clinical signs, magnetic resonance imaging features, and outcome after surgical and medical treatment of otogenic intracranial infection in 11 cats and 4 dogs.
AB  == brainstem dysfunction resulting from central extension of infection is a life-threatening complication of otitis media/interna (omi) that has been described infrequently in dogs and cats. we review the clinical signs of disease, diagnostic findings, and results of surgical and medical treatments of brainstem  disease attributable to otogenic intracranial infection in cats and dogs. eleven  cats and 4 dogs were examined because of acute, subacute, or chronic clinical signs of brain disease including central vestibular signs, altered mentation, abnormal posture/gait, cranial nerve deficits, and seizures. results of a minimal database (cbc, serum biochemical panel, urinalysis, thoracic radiographs, and abdominal ultrasonographic images or radiographs) were within reference intervals in all animals. magnetic resonance (mr) images of the head were acquired for all  animals, and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from 9 of 11 cats and 3 of 4 dogs was examined. surgical exploration and ventral bulla osteotomy were done for 12 of 15 animals, followed by 1-3 months of antibiotic therapy; the remaining animals were euthanized before treatment. in all animals, mr imaging was effective in characterizing the location and extent of the pathologic changes intracranially as well as within middle/inner ear structures. results of csf analysis were characteristic of bacterial infection in most of the animals with acute or subacute disease. since long-term outcome in all treated animals was very good to excellent, it was concluded that dogs and cats with intracranial disease secondary to extension of otitis media/interna have a good-to-excellent prognosis when the condition was diagnosed and was treated by surgical exploration and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == isolation and expression of the lysis genes of actinomyces naeslundii phage av-1.
AB  == like most gram-positive oral bacteria, actinomyces naeslundii is resistant to salivary lysozyme and to most other lytic enzymes. we are interested in studying  the lysins of phages of this important oral bacterium as potential diagnostic and therapeutic agents. to identify the actinomyces phage genes encoding these species-specific enzymes in escherichia coli, we constructed a new cloning vector, pad330, that can be used to enrich for and isolate phage holin genes, which are located adjacent to the lysin genes in most phage genomes. cloned holin insert sequences were used to design sequencing primers to identify nearby lysin  genes by using whole phage dna as the template. from partial digestions of a. naeslundii phage av-1 genomic dna we were able to clone, in independent experiments, inserts that complemented the defective lambda holin in pad330, as evidenced by extensive lysis after thermal induction. the dna sequence of the inserts in these plasmids revealed that both contained the complete lysis region  of av-1, which is comprised of two holin-like genes, designated hola and holb, and an endolysin gene, designated lysa. we were able to subclone and express these genes and determine some of the functional properties of their gene products.

AB  == pyothorax was diagnosed in 27 cats between 1983 and 2002. in 21 (78%) of the cases, pleural fluid culture and/or cytology was consistent with a mixed anaerobic bacterial infection of oropharyngeal origin. in six cases (22%), infection was caused by unusual pathogens or pathogens of non-oropharyngeal origin, including a mycoplasma species, cryptococcus gattii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. the overall mortality rate was  22%. treatment was successful in 18 of 19 cases (95%) where closed thoracostomy tubes were inserted. one case resolved only after thoracotomy. actinomyces species were isolated in three cases and in contrast to dogs where thoracotomy is recommended, they were resolved with tube thoracostomy. mechanical complications  occurred in 58% of the cats with indwelling chest tubes. probable mechanisms of pleural space infection were identified in 18 cats (67%) including haematogenous  infection (n=1), direct inoculation of bacteria into the pleural space (n=1), intrathoracic oesophageal rupture (n=1) and parapneumonic extension of infection  (n=15; 56%). of the latter, perioperative aspiration was suspected in two cats, parasitic migration in two and antecedent upper respiratory tract infection was implicated in seven. parapneumonic spread of infection after colonisation and invasion of lung tissue by oropharyngeal flora appears to be the most frequent cause of feline anaerobic polymicrobial pyothorax and contests the widespread belief that direct inoculation of pleural cavity by bite wounds is more common.

TI  == identification of an sh3-binding motif in a new class of methionine aminopeptidases from mycobacterium tuberculosis suggests a mode of interaction with the ribosome.
AB  == the crystal structure of the methionine aminopeptidase (metap) from mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtmetap1c) has been determined in the apo- and methionine-bound forms. this is the first structure of a type i metap with a significant extension at the amino terminus. the catalytic domain is similar to that of escherichia coli metap (ecmetap), and the additional 40-residue segment wraps around the surface with an extended but well-defined structure. there are several members of the actinomyces family of bacteria that contain metaps with such n-terminal extensions, and we classify these as metap type ic (metap1c). some members of this family of bacteria also contain a second metap (type ia) similar in size to  ecmetap. the main difference between the apo- and the methionine-bound forms of mtmetap1c is in the conformation of the metal-binding residues. the position of the methionine bound in the active site is very similar to that found in many of  the known members of this family. side chains of several residues in the s1 and s1' subsites shift as much as 1.5 a compared to ecmetap. residues 14-17 have the  sequence pro-thr-arg-pro and adopt the conformation of a polyproline ii helix. model-building suggests that this pxxp segment can bind to an sh3 protein motif.  other type ib and type ic metaps with n-terminal extensions contain similarly located pxxp motifs. also, several ribosomal proteins are known to include sh3 domains, one of which is located close to the tunnel from which the nascent polypeptide chain exits the ribosome. therefore, it is proposed that the binding  of metaps to the ribosome is mediated by a complex between a pxxp motif on the protein and an sh3 domain on the ribosome. it is also possible that zinc-finger domains, which are located at the extreme n-terminus of type i metaps, may participate in interactions with the ribosome.

AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a  second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.

AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == improving protein pharmacokinetics by genetic fusion to simple amino acid sequences.
AB  == the role of primary amino acid sequences in protein pharmacokinetics, an issue of relevance in both basic knowledge and biotechnology, was addressed here using as  a starting point two repetitive antigens from the hemoflagellate trypanosoma cruzi that are known to stabilize their associated proteins in the bloodstream. a major drawback to their pharmacological application is that these repetitive sequences are highly immunogenic, being therefore the deletion of this characteristic desirable. based on sequence homology and epitope mapping analyses, an artificial repetitive sequence (pstad) was engineered. this motif was tested by genetic fusion to the c terminus of both the trypanosomal trans-sialidase and the rat tyrosine aminotransferase and found to produce a 4.5-6-fold increase in the half-life of the associated proteins in blood while displaying significantly lower immunogenicity. residues involved in the stabilizing properties of the novel peptide were mapped by a site-directed mutagenesis approach, allowing us to successfully identify another two motifs. searching databases for sequences displaying some homology, embedded in proline frameworks and associated to shed virulence factors from unrelated microorganisms, resulted in the identification of four other protein extensions.  remarkably, three of them (from streptococcus pneumoniae, actinomyces viscosus, and escherichia coli) revealed similar pharmacokinetic features, suggesting therefore an analogous evolutionarily acquired mechanism to ensure the biodistribution of their corresponding proteins. our findings indicate that the insertion of defined motifs into a proline-rich framework constitutes a suitable  alternative to construct a chimeric protein with extended half-life in blood.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == crowding and winter emergency feeding as predisposing factors for kerato-conjunctivitis in semi-domesticated reindeer in norway.
AB  == due to the hard environmental and climatic situation in late winter 1999, a herd  of about 200 free-ranging, semi-domesticated reindeer was gathered in a paddock in northern norway for emergency feeding. about the same number of reindeer was not corralled but supplementary fed on their winter pastures. the fodder was of relatively good quality but very dusty and fed in a very dry environment. six weeks later, an outbreak of eye-infection was diagnosed in one third of the corralled reindeer; mild symptoms were observed in most of them, but 11 animals showed severe signs of disease. no signs of disease were found in the non-corralled animals. ten reindeer died through emaciation, the eleventh was sacrificed. histopathological diagnosis of two severely affected eyes revealed a  severe purulent kerato-conjunctivitis with bacteria and plant particles embedded  in purulent exudates on the cornea and conjunctiva. in one eye from the two most  affected animals actinomyces pyogenes, coagulase-negative staphylococci and escherichia coli and in the other one staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli  were found. the bacteria encountered in this study are not considered the primary cause of disease. they seem rather to be opportunistic infectious agents of eyes  that have been irritated mechanically through exposure to dusty fodder in a dry environment. the stress through unfamiliar corralling of the reindeer, that followed an insufficient fodder supply, could be considered as an additional infection supporting factor. this case-report emphasises on the importance of different factors involved in favouring outbreaks of disease in reindeer, under intensified husbandry conditions. even though crowding and emergency feeding may  be, at certain circumstances, the only means of survival for reindeer, a negative impact of implied crowding diseases on their productivity, must be considered, as well.

TI  == bovine mastitis in selected areas of southern ethiopia.
AB  == a study on bovine mastitis, designed to determine the causal agents, prevalence of infection and impact of risk factors in three cattle breeds, was conducted in  selected areas of southern ethiopia. a total of 307 lactating and non-lactating cows, of which 162 were indigenous zebu, 85 jersey and 60 holstein-friesian. were examined by clinical examination and the california mastitis (cmt) test. of these, 40.4% were positive by cmt and bacteriology for clinical or subclinical mastitis, with prevalence rates of 37.1% and 62.9%, respectively. out of 1133 quarters examined, 212 (18.7%) were found to be infected, 83 (39.21%) clinically  and 129 (60.8%) subclinically. the prevalence of mastitis was significantly higher in holstein-friesian than in indigenous zebu, in non-lactating cows than in lactating cows, in the early lactation stage than in the mid-lactation stage,  in cows with lesions and/or tick infestation on skin of udder and/or teats than in cows without this factor, and in the wet season than in the dry season. mastitis increased with parity number (r = 0.9). of 248 cmt and clinically positive udder quarter samples analysed microbiologically, 212 were culturally positive for known mastitis pathogens and 36 were negative. of the 199 positive samples. staphylococcus accounted for 39.2%. streptococcus for 23.6%, coliforms for 14.1%, micrococcus and bacillus species for 8.0% each and actinomyces or arcanobacterium (corynebacterium) for 7.0%. it was concluded that there was a high prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis, mainly caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli, in this study area.

TI  == geldanamycin treatment ameliorates the response to lps in murine macrophages by decreasing cd14 surface expression.
AB  == geldanamycin (ga) is an antibiotic produced by actinomyces, which specifically inhibits the function of the heat shock protein 90 family. treatment of a murine  macrophage cell line (j774) with ga resulted in a reduced response to escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) as visualized by a decrease of nf-kappab translocation into the nucleus and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). to elucidate the mechanism of this effect, the expression of cd14, the formal lps receptor, was analyzed. cells treated with ga showed a reduced level of surface cd14 detected by immunostaining, whereas the expression of other surface receptors, such as fc-gamma receptor and tumor necrosis factor receptors  (tnf-r1 and tnf-r2), was unaffected. the reduced surface level of cd14 was not due to a reduction in its expression because cd14 steady state mrna levels or the total cellular pool of cd14 was not altered by ga treatment. surface cd14 was more rapidly internalized after ga treatment (2-3 h) than after incubation with cycloheximide. immunostaining of permeabilized cells after ga treatment revealed  a higher intracellular content of cd14 colocalizing with calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum (er) protein. these results suggest that the decrease in cd14 surface expression after ga treatment is due to rapid internalization without new replacement. these effects may be due to the inhibition of hsp90 and grp94 by ga  in macrophages.

AB  == rsf1010 is a naturally occurring escherichia coli broad host-range plasmid about  8.7 kb in size. it can be mobilized at high frequency between different gram-negative bacterial species when transfer functions are available in trans. following the pioneering work of conjugational transfer of rsf1010 from e. coli to streptomyces lividans and mycobacterium smegmatis, the transfer of this plasmid by conjugation from e. coli s17.1 tp two gram-positive rare actinomycetes, nocardia asteroides 3927 and streptoverticillum caespitosus atcc27422 was first time reported in this study. southern blot analysis of the total dna extracted from the actinomycetes' exconjugants proved that rsf1010 had  been transferred from e. coli into the two new hosts and maintained staby in the  exconjugants. meanwhile, partial deletions of rsf1010 replicon loosing its antibiotics resistance makers were readily detected in e. coli. the implenmentation of this observation was discussed.

TI  == the lon gene, encoding an atp-dependent protease, is a novel member of the hair/hspr stress-response regulon in actinomycetes.
AB  == members of a family of atp-dependent proteases related to lon from escherichia coli are present in most prokaryotes and eukaryotes. these proteases are generally reported to be heat induced, and various regulatory systems have been described. the authors cloned and disrupted the lon gene and studied the regulation of its expression in streptomyces lividans. lon is negatively regulated by the hspr/hair repressor/operator system, suggesting that lon is produced concomitantly with the other members of this regulon, dnak and clpb. the lon mutant grew more slowly than the wild-type and spore germination was impaired at high temperature. nevertheless its cell cycle was not greatly affected and it  sporulated normally.

TI  == molecular cloning and expression in escherichia coli of an exo-levanase gene from the endophytic bacterium gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus srt4.
AB  == gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus produces levan from sucrose by a secreted levansucrase (lsda). a levanase-encoding gene ( lsdb), starting 51 bp downstream  of the lsda gene, was cloned from strain srt4. the lsdb gene (1605 bp) encodes a  protein (calculated molecular mass 58.4 kda) containing a putative 36-amino-acid  signal peptide at the n-terminus. the deduced amino acid sequence shares 34%, 33%, 32%, and 29% identities with levanases from actinomyces naeslundii, bacillus subtilis, paenibacillus polymyxa, and bacteroides fragilis, respectively. the lsdb expression in escherichia coli under the control of the t7 rna polymerase promoter resulted in an active enzyme which hydrolyzed levan, inulin, 1-kestose,  raffinose, and sucrose, but not melezitose. levanase activity was maximal at ph 6.0 and 30 degrees c, and it was not inhibited by the metal ion chelator edta or  the denaturing agents dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol. the recombinant lsdb showed a fourfold higher rate of hydrolysis on levan compared to inulin, and the reaction on both substrates resulted in the successive liberation of the terminal fructosyl residues without formation of intermediate oligofructans, indicating a non-specific exo-levanase activity.

AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == clinical and bacteriological aspects on the use of oxytetracycline and flunixin in primiparous cows with induced retained placenta and post-partal endometritis.
AB  == retention of the fetal membranes and post-partal endometritis (rfm) are common problems in dairy cows. treatment often includes manual removal of the placenta in combination with antibiotic treatment. earlier studies have shown that cows with endometritis post-partum have a strong tendency to recover spontaneously. the present study focused on treatments of post-partal endometritis with the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, flunixin (f) either alone or combined with oxytetracycline (t). the study was conducted in two experiments, using 12 primiparous cows in each. as a model for rfm, premature parturition was induced in late pregnant heifers by injecting pgf2alpha (25 mg i.m.) twice with a 24 h interval. in each experiment the cows were set into four groups and treated with  either t (10 mg/kg bw i.m. once daily), f (2.2 mg/kg bw p.o. twice daily), a combination of t and f (dosage, as above) or conservatively (group 0, no drugs).  the treatment periods lasted from days 11-14 post-partum in experiment i (groups  t1, f1, tf1 and 0) and from days 3-6 post-partum in experiment 2 (groups t2, f2,  tf2 and 0). jugular vein blood samples were collected for analyses of flunixin and total white blood cells. uterine biopsies were collected twice weekly for investigation of endometrial microbiology. rectal palpation and ultrasonographic  examinations were performed three times weekly for investigations of uterine involution and ovarian activity. no attempts were made to remove the placentas manually. the experiment lasted until day 56 post-partum. the induction of parturition was successful in all heifers and 22 of 24 animals had rfm. all rfm cows had bacterial endometritis. the predominant bacteria were escherichia coli alpha-haemolytic streptococci, fusobacterium necrophorum, arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, bacteroides spp., pasteurella spp. and proteus spp. fusobacterium necrophorum and a. pyogenes could be isolated for 3-5 weeks post-partum and e. coli pasteurella and proteus could be isolated for 2-3 weeks post-partum. animals treated with tetracycline after placental shedding (t1 and tf1) had a more rapid recovery from infections with a. pyogenes and f. necrophorum than animals that were not treated with tetracycline. no other genera were affected. antibiotic treatment before placental shedding (t2 and tf2) did not shorten the uterine infection but altered the bacterial flora, seen as an overgrowth of proteus spp. (p < 0.05) and increased frequency of pasteurella (p < 0.05). the alpha-haemolytic streptococci were less common in t2 and tf2 than in other groups (ns). antibiotic treatment of cows before placental shedding (t2 or  tf2, n = 6) postponed detachment of placenta compared to cows were no antibiotics were administered before placental shedding (t1, tf1, f1, f2 and 0, n = 16. 9.8 days pp (median) versus p = 0.004). neither treatment shortened uterine involution. flunixin treatments did not seem to influence recovery from infection or uterine involution. it was concluded that early oxytetracycline treatment of retained fetal membranes in the cow did not shorten the uterine involution or uterine infection but it did slow down the detachment process of the retained placenta. oxytetracycline treatment after placental shedding might shorten the uterine infection but otherwise did not affect the clinical results. flunixin treatment had no influence on the clinical outcome of the disease.

TI  == influence of puerperal uterine infection on uterine involution and postpartum ovarian activity in dairy cows.
AB  == this article presents the results of a clinical trial designed to study the effect of puerperal uterine infection on uterine involution and on ovarian activity in dairy cows, monitored twice weekly from parturition until the sixth week postpartum (wpp). infection significantly retarded uterine involution assessed by the uterine body diameter and a score of intrauterine fluid volume (iufv). by the sixth wpp, cows with normal puerperium (controls) and cows that showed mild puerperal endometritis had similar uterine body diameter and iufv, indicating spontaneous recovery within the postpartum voluntary waiting period. however, in cows with severe puerperal endometritis, although uterine body diameter had regressed to pregravid size, iufv remained significantly higher than in control and mild endometritis cows, indicating that chronic endometritis was established. the iufv score was positively and significantly correlated with uterine swab bacterial growth density and allowed diagnosis of endometritis after the third wpp. cows with mild or severe endometritis had a significantly higher prevalence and persistence of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, actinomyces  pyogenes, gram-negative anaerobes - gna) than controls. actinomyces pyogenes was  associated to gna in 74% of isolations. ovarian activity measured by ultrasound scanning of the ovaries and plasma progesterone (p4) concentrations was more abnormal (prolonged anoestrus, prolonged luteal phases and ovarian cysts) in cows with severe endometritis than in controls.

TI  == influence of escherichia coli and arcanobacterium pyogenes isolated from bovine puerperal uteri on phenotypic and functional properties of neutrophils.
AB  == when cows develop endometritis after birth, escherichia coli and arcanobacterium  pyogenes are usually the most prominent bacteria present in bovine uterine lochial secretions. a. pyogenes alone is rarely found in the course of a disturbed puerperium. this was confirmed in this study, since average and high-grade uterine contaminations were always associated with the presence of both bacteria. the contamination grade was positively correlated with uterine polymorphonuclear granulocyte (pmn) numbers and negatively correlated with blood  pmn numbers. whether e. coli and a. pyogenes affect the phenotype and function of bovine pmn in a similar or differential way was subject to in vitro studies. pmn  were tested in the presence of washed bacterial fragments or culture supernatants taken as a source for soluble and/or secreted bacterial products. fragments and soluble products differed only quantitatively in their effects on pmn. usually, long-time exposure (24h) of pmn to fragments induced the strongest effects. accelerated death of granulocytes was only moderately induced by both e. coli and a. pyogenes products. both e. coli and a. pyogenes products induced the enhanced  expression of a membrane molecule detected by mab il-a110 and of cd11b. expression of other surface structures remained largely unchanged (mhc class i, cd11c). functional parameters of pmn (phagocytosis; generation of reactive oxygen species, ros; antibody-independent cellular cytotoxicity, aicc) generally declined after pre-incubation for 24h with products of e. coli or a. pyogenes. interestingly, soluble products of a. pyogenes stimulated the phagocytosis of pmn. however, co-incubation with e. coli products abrogated this stimulatory effect. the results supply evidence for similar modes of action of the gram-negative e. coli and the gram-positive a. pyogenes on bovine pmn. alterations in pmn function and phenotype are mainly triggered by direct contact  between bacterial fragments and pmn. inhibition experiments with polymyxin b demonstrated that e. coli-mediated effects were not solely due to the action of lipopolysaccharide. the dominant functional depression of neutrophils by e. coli  products strengthens the suggestion that the earlier appearance of e. coli in the uterus may support the co-infection of this organ by a. pyogenes at later times.

TI  == induction of parturition with prostaglandin f2 alpha as a possible model to study impaired reproductive performance in the dairy cow.
AB  == parturitions were induced in five cows, 2 weeks before term using prostaglandin (pg) f(2alpha). two i.m. injections were performed with an interval of 24 h. all  cows calved within 5 days (average 2.7 days) after the first injection of pgf(2alpha). out of five cows, four had retained fetal membranes (rfm). each animal was sampled for bacteriological examination using uterine biopsies twice a week during 42 days postpartum (pp). jugular vein blood samples were withdrawn for pgf(2alpha)-metabolite and progesterone analyses five times per day during the first week pp and eight times per 24 h during the 2nd and 3rd weeks pp. from  the 4th week, the sampling interval was reduced back to five times per day. from  the 5th week pp, the sampling was reduced to two times per day and sampling was terminated after day 46 pp. only morning samples were used for progesterone analyses. from day 10 pp, ultrasonography (us) was performed every 3rd day until  day 39 pp for detection of ovarian activity and follicular dynamics. the highest  incidence of bacteriological species was found during the first 3 weeks pp. after the 5th week of collection, all animals were free from bacteria. the species of bacteria found were arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, escherichia coli, alpha-hemolytic streptococcae and pasteurella multocida. immediately after parturition, very high levels of the pg-metabolite were seen in all animals, with a sharp decrease to line of significance around days 9-12 pp. small increases above the line of significance were detected up to day 27 pp in cows with rfm, and after that time the levels were considered to be at baseline. low levels of progesterone were seen in four animals during the whole experimental time. in one animal, an increase was seen on day 43 pp, which was maintained until the end of  the experimental period on day 46 pp. based on us, follicular waves were detected in all animals during the experimental period. in three animals, three non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected and in two animals, four non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected during 39 days of ultrasound sessions. based on progesterone levels, only one animal was considered to have ovulated around day 40 pp. results from the present study indicate that reproductive performance of cows after pg-induced parturitions differs from those of spontaneous cases of rfm. differences regarding the resumption of ovarian activity were also observed between previous studies of dexamethasone-induced parturitions and the present study.

AB  == arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, a causative agent of various pyogenic diseases in domestic animals, produces a hemolysin which is thought to be an important virulence factor. this hemolysin was purified from the culture supernatant of a. pyogenes swine isolate. the purified hemolysin showed a single  band with a molecular mass of 56 kda on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its isoelectric point was 9.2. the activity of this hemolysin was not enhanced by the addition of l-cysteine or sodium thioglycolate, but it was inhibited by cholesterol. the gene encoding the hemolysin was cloned, sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli by means of zap express vector. analysis by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with immunoblotting showed that the molecular weight of the hemolysin expressed in e. coli is the same as that of the hemolysin purified from a. pyogenes. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,605 bp encoding a 534 amino acid protein of 57,989 da. the nucleotide sequence of the hemolysin gene from a. pyogenes swine isolate differed only slightly (97.6% identity) from the sequence of plo gene from a. pyogenes strain bbr1 reported by billington et al (j. bacteriol. 179: 6100-6106,  1997). the cysteine residue existed in the undecapeptide region of the hemolysin, which is highly conserved in thiol-activated cytolysins (cholesterol-binding cytolysins), and is replaced with alanine. therefore, the hemolysin of a. pyogenes seems to be a novel member of the thiol-activated cytolysin family.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in spontaneous bovine bronchopneumonia.
AB  == the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), major histocompatibility class ii molecules (mhc-ii), cd68, and the calcium-binding proteins s100a8 and s100a9 (also called mrp8 and mrp14, respectively) was assessed in lung tissues from cattle that succumbed to pneumonia. expression patterns of these markers were related to the types of lung lesion. inos expression was only observed in lungs infected with arcanobacterium pyogenes or pasteurella haemolytica but not in lungs from cattle with subacute chronic interstitial pneumonia and acute interstitial pneumonia due to escherichia coli infection. high levels of inos were expressed by cells (probably leukocytes) surrounding necrotic foci. occasionally, inos was expressed by intraalveolar macrophages in viable parenchyma, by leukocytes within the airways, and by some chondrocytes in the supporting cartilage of bronchi. cells expressing mhc-ii were distributed relatively evenly throughout areas of inflammation and did not display any clear association with necrotic foci. cell types expressing mhc-ii included type ii alveolar epithelial cells, spindle-shaped cells of the interstitium, cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, and leukocytes in lymph and blood vessels but largely excluded inos-positive cells. likewise, cd68-positive cells were rarely positive for inos and were not confined to the areas surrounding necrotic tissue. as with mhc-ii and cd68, there was little if any coexpression of inos and either of the s100 proteins tested. thus, in cattle  with necrotizing bronchopneumonia, inos-expressing cells were largely restricted  to the cellular zone surrounding necrotic areas.

TI  == pyruvate phosphate dikinase from a thermophilic actinomyces microbispora rosea subsp. aerata: purification, characterization and molecular cloning of the gene.
AB  == various thermophilic bacteria were analyzed by southern hybridization analysis using oligonucleotide probes coding for the pyruvate phosphate dikinase (ppdk) gene from clostridium symbiosum, and positive hybridization signals were observed in the chromosomal dnas from microbispora rosea subsp. aerata (ifo 14047). ppdk activity was detected in lactose induced cells and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of ppdk was estimated to be 230000 by gel filtration chromatography and 91000 by sds-page, suggesting that ppdk is a dimeric enzyme. this enzyme was specific for adenine nucleotide and the apparent  km values for amp, ppi, and phosphoenolpyruvate were 5, 38, and 280 microm, respectively. it was stable in the ph range 6 to 11, and retained 80% activity after 60 min heat treatment at 60 degrees c. we cloned the ppdk gene from m. rosea. it consists of 878 amino acids with a molecular mass of 95514. sequence comparison indicates around 50% similarity with other ppdks and it has all the highly conserved regions of the related enzymes. we expressed the ppdk gene in escherichia coli and obtained enzymatically active protein.

TI  == insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  == most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon tn916 mutagenesis of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis). a 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dlta and dltb of lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (formerly called lactobacillus casei). a 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous dna in a fosmid library of s. gordonii dl1. this dna encoded d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. the cloned streptococcal dlta was disrupted by inserting an ermam cassette, and then it was  linearized and transformed into s. gordonii dl1 for allelic replacement. erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dlta exhibited a loss of d-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (lta) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. this phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kda surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (c. j. whittaker, d. l. clemans, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). the mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric  coaggregations. the mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. the natural dna transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. southern analysis of chromosomal dnas from  various streptococcal species with the dlta probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. thus, it is hypothesized that d-alanyl lta may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kda adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.

TI  == bacteria associated with clinical mastitis in dairy heifers.
AB  == a 1-yr field investigation of clinical mastitis in heifers was carried out in 24  veterinary districts in norway. quarter lacteal secretions from cases that occurred prepartum or within 14 d postpartum were examined bacteriologically. the study included 1040 heifers with clinical mastitis, and the total number of quarters that were clinically affected was 1361. the organisms that were most frequently isolated from samples from these quarters were staphylococcus aureus (44.3%), streptococcus dysgalactiae (18.2%), staph. aureus together with strep. dysgalactiae (1.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12.8%), arcanobacterium pyogenes (3.5%), a. pyogenes together with strep. dysgalactiae (0.5%) or staph. aureus (0.4%), and escherichia coli (6.4%). of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus simulans (53.7%), staphylococcus hyicus (14.8%), and staphylococcus chromogenes (14.8%) were the most prevalent species. except for a higher relative percentage of a. pyogenes in cases that occurred before parturition (8.2%) than in cases that occurred after parturition (2.7%), no significant differences were observed in the distribution of the various organisms among prepartum and postpartum cases. regional variations were observed in the distribution of organisms. the proportions of staph. aureus and a. pyogenes were highest, and the proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococci was lowest, in late autumn and early winter. the proportion of e. coli was highest in summer. in heifers in which mastitis was associated with increased rectal temperature or other systemic signs, the proportion of clinically affected quarters that were infected with staph. aureus was larger than that in heifers without systemic reaction.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == incidence risk and aetiology of mammary abnormalities in dry ewes in 10 flocks in southern greece.
AB  == in a field investigation of 10 flocks in southern greece, 3367 dairy ewes were examined twice, in order to estimate the incidence risk and the aetiology of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period. abnormal secretion, lumps, nodules,  diffuse hardness, abscesses and cysts were the abnormalities detected. the cumulative incidence of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period was 5.1% (95% confidence interval: 4.4-5.8%); 47% of the cases detected developed during the first three weeks after cessation of lactation. despite variation in the flock size, there was no between-flock variation in the risk of a ewe developing mammary abnormalities. staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative isolates) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from mammary samples; actinomyces pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, streptococci and  escherichia coli were also isolated. resistance was encountered among the staphylococcal isolates.

TI  == experimental induction of renal lesions in chickens.
AB  == the present work was conducted to investigate the possibility of inducing renal lesions in chickens subcutaneously or orally inoculated with e. coli [e. coli o1k67(b12)], staphylococcus aureus and actinomyces pyogenes. the strains were previously isolated from the kidneys of broilers showing different pathological lesions. the gross lesions observed in the kidneys included enlargement, congestion, haemorrhagic spots in addition to dilatation and distension of the ureters. the microscopic lesions were mainly interstitial nephritis. the lesions  were acute and changed gradually to subacute or chronic nephritis. the glomerular lesions were not common. the wall of the primary branches of the ureter and the ureters was heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells, also granular and albuminous casts were seen in the renal tubules. the lesions were not related to  the inoculated pathogen, although they were more severe in chickens inoculated with e. coli and staph. aureus more than in actinomyces pyogenes. reisolation of  the inoculated pathogens was more successful from the birds inoculated subcutaneously than from those infected orally.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbrial structural subunit gene, fima, and the 3' flanking dna region was determined. the fima gene encoded a 535-amino-acid precursor subunit protein (fima) which included both n-terminal leader and c-terminal cell wall sorting sequences. a second gene, designated orf365, that encoded a 365-amino-acid protein which contained a putative transmembrane segment was identified immediately 3' to fima. mutants in which either fima or orf365 was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene did not participate in type 2 fimbriae-mediated coaggregation with streptococcus oralis 34. type 2 fimbrial antigen was not detected in cell extracts of the fima mutant by western blotting with anti-a. naeslundii type 2 fimbrial antibody, but the subunit protein was detected in extracts of the orf365 mutant. the subunit protein detected in this mutant also was immunostained by an  antibody raised against a synthetic peptide representing the c-terminal 20 amino  acid residues of the predicted fima. the antipeptide antibody reacted with fima isolated from the recombinant escherichia coli clone containing fima but did not  react with purified type 2 fimbriae in extracts of the wild-type strain. these results indicate that synthesis of type 2 fimbriae in a. naeslundii t14v may involve posttranslational cleavage of both the n-terminal and c-terminal peptides of the precursor subunit and also the expression of orf365.

TI  == primary pulmonary botryomycosis: case report and review.
AB  == botryomycosis is an uncommon bacterial disease characterized by the microscopic formation of eosinophilic granules that resemble those of infection by actinomyces species. the diagnosis of botryomycosis can be made when microscopic  inspection and culture of the granules reveal gram-positive cocci or gram-negative bacilli. botryomycosis is caused by common bacterial pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet the host and microbial factors that contribute to the pathobiology remain unknown. pulmonary botryomycosis can resemble actinomycosis, tuberculosis, or invasive carcinoma by causing a mass lesion with constitutional symptoms. radiographically, it invades bone and disrupts tissue planes. successful treatment often requires a combination of both surgical debridement and long-term antimicrobial therapy. we report a case of primary pulmonary botryomycosis and review the literature on this unusual infectious process.

TI  == anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  == reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. as expected, the cations fe2+ and cu+ enhanced killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5 by hydroperoxides. however, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to o2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. sensitivities to anaerobic killing by fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 were approximately as sensitive as s. mutans gs-5. enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, and actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 had intermediate sensitivity, while lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 and escherichia coli b were insensitive. killing of s. mutans gs-5 in response to millimolar levels of added fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and ph. the organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to fe2+ exposure. fe2+, but not fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of s. mutans. the reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to fe2+ inhibition of f-atpase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or f1 enzyme separated from membranes. cu+ and cu2+ also inhibited f-atpase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. all of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.

AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == regulation of uterine immune function during the estrous cycle and in response to infectious bacteria in sheep.
AB  == uterine infections are a major reproductive problem in livestock. we conducted two experiments to investigate factors that may modulate uterine responses to infectious bacteria. in exp. 1, ewes received intrauterine inoculations of either saline or bacteria (75 x 10(7) cfu of actinomyces pyogenes and 35 x 10(7) cfu of  escherichia coli) on either d 0 or 7 of the estrous cycle. vena caval samples containing uteroovarian blood were collected twice daily from 12 h before until 6 d after inoculation. only ewes inoculated with bacteria on d 7 developed infections. basal (4.8 vs .4 pmol), lipopolysaccharide-stimulated (14.2 vs 6.1 pmol), and concanavalin a-stimulated (65.8 vs 21.6 pmol) blastogenesis (i.e., [3h]thymidine incorporation) of vena caval lymphocytes was greater (p < or = .002) for ewes inoculated with bacteria or saline on d 0 rather than on d 7. the  number (per 100 white blood cells) of lymphocytes was greater (41.3 vs 30.8, p <  .001) and that of neutrophils was less (42.5 vs 51.6, p < .001) in ewes inoculated on d 0 rather than d 7. bacteria increased (p < .05) vena caval pgf(2  alpha) but not pge2 concentrations. in exp. 2, two protein fractions (molecular weights of > or = 100 kda and approximately 12.7 kda) from chromatography of uterine flushings collected on d 0 or 7, or 18 d after ovariectomy on d 0 or 7, modulated phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blastogenesis; the heavier fraction from  d 0 had a stimulatory component, but the major effects of the fractions were inhibitory. the differences in immune function and regulation between d 0 and 7 probably explain how the uterus of follicular phase ewes was able to prevent the  development of an infection.

AB  == background: hiv infection is common in mothers and their children in zimbabwe, and hiv-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. there is little information on the etiology and outcome of hiv-related bacteremia in african children. methods: blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having hiv, were examined for pathogens.  the association among significant bacteremia, hiv infection and mortality was assessed in these children. results: the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). nontyphoidal salmonella (10 children), escherichia coli (4 children) and klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent gram-negative bacteria. two children had rhodococcus equi pneumonia. hiv-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (or) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (or = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (or = 15.76). there was no  significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. mortality was 17%  overall but was higher in hiv-infected children up to 6 months of age (or = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (or = 2.03). conclusions: prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in hiv-infected children in africa.

AB  == the actinomyces naeslundii t14v gene levj encodes a sucrase with fructanase activity and may be responsible for the fructanase activity observed bound to the surface of a. naeslundii t14v cells. a large proportion of levj expressed in escherichia coli was translocated to the periplasm, and translocation and enzymatic activity were not affected by deletion of a putative cell-wall anchor sequence. the ph optimum of the enzyme was found to be between 5.5 and 6.5 whether the substrate was sucrose or inulin, although inulinase activity was more sensitive than sucrose activity to perturbation of the ph from the optimum. the relation between levj inulinase activity and ph was similar to that of a. naeslundii whole cells. levj exhibited standard saturation kinetics with sucrose, and the k(m) was calculated to be 89 mm, but it was not possible to calculate a k(m) for inulin. evidence for inhibition of inulinase activity but not sucrase activity by high concentrations of inulin was obtained.

AB  == the post-partum intrauterine bacterial flora, prostaglandin release, uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity were studied in 9 swedish dairy cows during the first 8-week period. uterine involution was monitored by transrectal examinations of the reproductive tract 3 times weekly. bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. the main pgf2 alpha metabolite (15-ketodihydro-pgf2 alpha) was monitored from twice daily blood plasma samples, while morning samples were used for progesterone determinations. the cows were assigned to 2 groups: group i (n = 7) with an uncomplicated puerperal period and group ii (n = 2) with signs of intrauterine infections. a total of 143 biopsies were collected, of which 129 (90.2%) were found to be bacteriologically negative. thirteen (9.1%) of the remaining 14 biopsies were bacteriologically positive, while one (0.7%) was probably a contamination on a single occasion. the 13 bacteriologically positive biopsies belonged to the group ii cows from which 31 isolates contained 6 different genera of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. actinomyces pyogenes along with bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium necrophorum were found to predominate in a mixed flora. the bacteria were rapidly eliminated and disappeared completely from the uteri towards the end of the third week post-partum. the average number of days required for completion of uterine involution was 21.8 +/- 3.0 for all animals. the plasma levels of the pgf2 alpha metabolite were significantly elevated for the first 12-18, and 18 and 27 days in group i and group ii, respectively. there was no significant relationship between the duration of pgf2  alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution (p > 0.05). progesterone analysis showed resumption of ovarian activity and subsequent ovulation in 4 of the 9 cows 44-55 days post-partum. thus, intrauterine infections are not commonly seen in cows with normal calving and comparison between the duration of pgf2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution showed insignificant correlation. however, the longer duration of pgf2 alpha release recorded in the 2 cows with intrauterine infections are related to the increased frequency of infections.

TI  == putative glycoprotein and glycolipid polymorphonuclear leukocyte receptors for the actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 fimbrial lectin.
AB  == recognition of receptors on sialidase-treated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) by the gal/galnac lectin associated with the type 2 fimbriae of certain strains of actinomyces results in activation of the pmns, phagocytosis, and destruction of the bacteria. in the present study, plant lectins were utilized as probes to identify putative pmn receptors for the actinomyces lectin. the gal-reactive lectin from ricinus communis (rcai), the gal/galnac-reactive lectins from r. communis (rcaii) and bauhinia purpurea (bpa), as well as the gal beta 1-3galnac-specific lectins from arachis hypogaea (pna) and agaricus bisporus (aba) inhibited killing of actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 by sialidase-treated pmns. these five lectins detected a 130-kda surface-labeled glycoprotein on nitrocellulose transfers of pmn extracts separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. this glycoprotein was revealed only after treatment of the transfers with sialidase, a condition analogous to the sialidase dependence of the lectin-mediated biological responses of the pmns to the actinomyces. the mannose-reactive lectin concanavalin a did not inhibit killing of the actinomyces and failed to detect the 130-kda glycoprotein but did  block pmn-dependent killing of escherichia coli b, a bacterium that possesses mannose-sensitive fimbriae. therefore, the pmn glycoprotein receptor for a. naeslundii is clearly distinct from those recognized by e. coli. two major putative glycolipid receptors were also identified by actinomyces and rcai overlays on sialidase-treated thin-layer chromatograms of pmn gangliosides. thus, both a 130-kda glycoprotein and certain gangliosides are implicated in the attachment of the actinomyces to pmns.

TI  == the gene encoding the beta-1,4-endoglucanase (cela) from myxococcus xanthus: evidence for independent acquisition by horizontal transfer of binding and catalytic domains from actinomycetes.
AB  == the cela gene encoding a beta-1,4 endoglucanase (cela) from myxococcus xanthus has been cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. the c-terminal region of cela  displayed a high level of similarity with the catalytic domain of several egl belonging to the glycosyl hydrolases family 6 (cena from cellulomonas fimi, cela  from microbispora bispora, e2 from thermonospora fusca, casa from streptomyces ksm9 and cela1 from streptomyces halstedii) and less similarity to the cellobiohydrolases of the fungi trichoderma reesei and agaricus bisporus. using pcr amplification we found in another myxobacterium, stigmatella aurantiaca, a part of a glycosyl hydrolase belonging to the same family. the n-terminal part of cela displayed significant similarities with the cellulose-binding domain of other cellulases belonging to a rare subset of family ii, such as the avicelase i from streptomyces reticuli, both tandem repeats n1 and n2 of the cellulase cenc from cellulomonas fimi, and the n-terminal part of the egl e1 from thermonospora  fusca. analyses of the multiple alignments and reconstruction of phylogenetic trees strongly suggest that both domains of cela were acquired by independent horizontal transfers between gram+ soil bacteria and scavenging myxobacteria followed by domain shuffling.

TI  == permeabilization of mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes for in situ hybridization with fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == the application of whole-cell hybridization using labelled oligonucleotide probes in microbial systematics and ecology is limited by difficulties in permeabilizing many gram-positive organisms. in this investigation paraformaldehyde treatment, acid methanolysis and acid hydrolysis were evaluated as a means of permeabilizing mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes prior to hybridization with a fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probe designed to bind to a conserved sequence of bacterial 16s rrna. methods were evaluated on stationary-phase cultures of gordona bronchialis, mycobacterium fortuitum, nocardia asteroides, n. brasiliensis, rhodococcus equi, r. erythropolis, r. fascians, r. rhodochrous and  tsukamurella paurometabola, none of which could be probed following 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixation. for comparison and to test the general applicability of mild acid pretreatments, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida were also studied. the data showed that most of the mycolic-acid-containing organisms were successfully permeabilized by  mild acid hydrolysis in 1 m hcl at 37 degrees c. cells were treated for different lengths of time. in general, the mycolic-acid-containing organisms required between 30 and 50 min hydrolysis, whereas b. subtilis, e. coli and p. putida were rendered permeable in only 10 min. interestingly, l. plantarum could not be permeabilized using acid hydrolysis even after 60 min exposure to 1 m hcl.

TI  == the effect of indigenous bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells on subsequent microbial adhesion in vitro.
AB  == despite the numerous investigations on the adhesion of microorganisms to buccal epithelial cells, it is difficult to correlate different results, as disparate adherence values have been reported for a given organism. as one reason for this  disparity may be the indigenous or natural bacterial populations on human buccal  epithelial cells, the effect of the latter on subsequent microbial adherence in vitro was examined. there was a highly significant correlation between the degree of natural bacterial colonization on pooled buccal epithelial cells from 8 healthy donors and the adhesion of a single isolate each of streptococcus mitis,  escherichia coli and actinomyces naeslundii. however, no such relationship could  be established for candida albicans, streptococcus milleri and another isolate of streptococcus mitis. as in previous studies, variation in adherence values was found, both between samples from different donors, and from the same donor over time, but to a far lesser degree in pooled samples from different donors. these results imply that natural bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells may affect the adhesion values derived from laboratory experimentation, and hence such data should be interpreted with caution.

AB  == leucine dehydrogenase has been purified to homogeneity from a moderate thermophilic actinomycete, thermoactinomyces intermedius ifo 14230. the enzyme can be stored without loss of its activity at a low temperature (e.g., 4 degrees  c) for over two years. the enzyme was more thermostable at higher concentrations  of salts such as nacl and kcl. it retained about 90% of activity on incubation at 70 degrees c for at least 40 min in the presence of 3 m nacl. the michaelis constants for nad, l-leucine, nadh, 2-oxoisocaproate and ammonia were determined  to be 0.36, 2.0, 0.042, 0.63 and 118 mm, respectively, from initial-velocity analyses. the enzyme showed pro-s stereospecificity for hydrogen transfer of nadh in the reductive amination. the enzyme gene was cloned into escherichia coli and  its complete dna sequence was determined. the leucine dehydrogenase gene (leudh)  consists of a 1098-bp open reading frame and encodes 366 amino acid residues corresponding to a subunit (m(r) 40586) of the octameric enzyme. the amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed 80.7% similarity with that of the bacillus stearothermophilus enzyme. the enzyme was overproduced in e. coli jm 109 having a recombinant plasmid, puldh2, which was constructed from puc18 and the leudh gene. the enzyme was purified from the cell extract to homogeneity in one day, with 78% recovery.

TI  == spontaneous uterine infections are associated with elevated prostaglandin f(2)alpha metabolite concentrations in postpartum dairy cows.
AB  == postpartum holstein (n=21) and jersey (n=4) cows were used to determine if uterine infections are associated with elevated plasma concentrations of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin f(2)alpha (pgfm). based upon clinical examinations and bacterial content of intrauterine fluid samples, cows detected with uterine infections between 21 and 28 d post partum were used (infected; n=14). these cows were matched with herdmates that were free of infection (control; n=11). beginning on the day the cows were assigned to the experiment (day 1), blood samples were collected on alternate days for the next 14 to 15 d.  plasma samples were stored at -20 degrees c until assayed. from day 1 until the end of the experiment, uterine fluid samples were collected transcervically twice weekly for aerobic bacterial culture. endometrial biopsies were collected between days 6 and 8 and days 13 and 15. control cows did not show signs of uterine infection throughout the trial, and bacterial cultures indicated that there were  no significant bacterial populations in the uteri of the control cows. the uteri  of infected cows harbored numerous microbes. actinomyces pyogenes was most prominent. various species of streptococcus and pasteurella were also prevalent in the infected cows. escherichia coli was present in the uterus of both infected and control cows. biopsies showed that infected cows had more (p<0.05) neutrophils, plasma cells and lymphocytes in the endometrium than did the control cows. as determined by plasma progesterone concentrations, 83% of the control and 50% of the infected cows had functional luteal tissue during the 2-wk sampling period. plasma pgfm profiles were linear (p<0.03) and did not differ between treatment groups (p>0.01). however, average plasma pgfm concentrations were greater (p<0.0001) in infected than in control cows. these data indicate that plasma pgfm concentrations are greater in postpartum cows with spontaneous uterine infections then in herdmates free of infection.

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

TI  == characterization of actinomyces with genomic dna fingerprints and rrna gene probes.
AB  == cellular dna from 25 actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces viscosus strains belonging to the 7 taxonomic clusters of fillery et al. (1978) and several unclustered strains was obtained by enzymatic and n-lauroylsarcosine/guanidine isothiocyanate treatment of whole cells, followed by extraction of the nucleic acid. the dna samples were digested with restriction endonucleases bamhi or pvuii, and agarose gel electrophoresis was used to obtain dna fingerprints. the dna fragments were subjected to southern blot hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe transcribed from escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. the patterns of bands from genomic (dna fingerprints) and rdna fingerprints (ribotypes) were used for comparison between the taxonomic cluster strains and strains within clusters. representative strains from each taxonomic cluster provided different bamhi dna fingerprints and ribotype patterns with 3 to 9 distinct bands. some strains within a cluster showed identical ribotype patterns  with both endonucleases (a. naeslundii b120 and a. naeslundii b102 from cluster 3), while others showed the same pattern with bamhi but a different pattern with  pvuii (a. naeslundii atcc 12104 and 398a from cluster 5). a viscosus atcc 15987 (cluster 7) and its parent strain t6 yielded identical fingerprint and ribotype patterns. the genomic diversity revealed by dna fingerprinting and ribotyping demonstrates that these techniques, which do not require phenotypic expression, are suited for study of the oral ecology of the actinomyces, and for epidemiological tracking of specific actinomyces strains associated with caries lesions and sites of periodontal destruction.

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == protein synthesis in vitro by micrococcus luteus.
AB  == bacillus subtilis and related gram-positive bacteria which have low to moderate genomic g + c contents are unable to efficiently translate mrna derived from gram-negative bacteria, whereas escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria are able to translate mrna from both types of organisms. this phenomenon has been termed translational species specificity. ribosomes from the low-g + c-content group (low-g + c group) of gram-positive organisms (b. subtilis and relatives) lack an equivalent to escherichia ribosomal protein s1. the requirement for s1 for translation in e. coli (g. van dieijen, p. h. van knippenberg, j. van duin, b. koekman, and p. h. pouwels, mol. gen. genet. 153:75-80, 1977) and its specific role (a.r. subramanian, trends biochem. sci. 9:491-494, 1984) have been proposed. the group of gram-positive bacteria characterized by high genomic g + c content (formerly actinomyces species and relatives) contain s1, in contrast to the low-g + c group (k. mikulik, j. smardova, a. jiranova, and p. branny, eur. j. biochem.  155:557-563, 1986). it is not known whether members of the high-g + c group are translationally specific, although there is evidence that one genus, streptomyces, can express escherichia genes in vivo (m. j. bibb and s. n. cohen,  mol. gen. genet. 187:265-277, 1985; j. l. schottel, m. j. bibb, and s. n. cohen,  j. bacteriol. 146:360-368, 1981). in order to determine whether the organisms of  this group are translationally specific, we examined the in vitro translational characteristics of a member of the high-g + c group, micrococcus luteus, whose genomic g + c content is 73%. a semipurified coupled transcription-translation system of m. luteus translates escherichia mrna as well as bacillus and micrococcus mrna. therefore, m. luteus is translationally nonspecific and resembles e. coli rather than b. subtilis in its translational characteristics.

TI  == n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase, etiologic agent, and duration of clinical signs  for sequential episodes of chronic clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == this study examined effects of repeated episodes of clinical mastitis in chronically infected quarters on milk n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity and duration of clinical signs. milk samples were collected at each clinical onset from 49 chronic mastitis cases on a 1700-cow michigan dairy farm. there were 49 first episodes of clinical mastitis, 49 second episodes, and 13 episodes  of third or more. agents isolated were staphylococcus aureus (18.4%), staphylococcus (7.3%), no growth (20.2%), environmental pathogens (streptococci other than agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., and  citrobacter spp.) (22.0%), other pathogens (serratia spp., bacillus spp., diphtheroids [corynebacterium spp. and actinomyces pyogenes], pseudomonas spp., and nocardia spp.) (11.9%), mixed pathogens (two agents isolated) (12.8%), and contaminated samples (7.3%). etiologic agents, duration of clinical signs, and nagase did not differ by episode number. the correlation between log of nagase and log of time until clinical recovery was .34. the relationship between nagase  and duration of clinical signs was strongest for second episodes, and weakest for third and greater episodes of chronic mastitis.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.

AB  == this study examines the results of bacterial culture from 159 endometrial biopsy  samples from 97 commercial dairy cows and correlations between bacteriological and histological findings. bacteria were isolated from approximately 80% of biopsies taken at day 26 and day 40 postpartum. eleven percent of biopsies were positive for both aerobic and anaerobic culture. streptococci, escherichia coli and actinomyces pyogenes were the most common isolates. isolation of a. pyogenes  from a biopsy at day 26 was positively correlated with isolation of anaerobic bacteria and segmented cell inflammation in the same biopsy, and with subsequent  isolation of a. pyogenes at day 40. there was a strong association between isolation of a. pyogenes and anaerobes at day 26 with increased uterine lesions at day 40. isolation of alpha hemolytic streptococci (ahs) was negatively correlated with isolation of a. pyogenes and with inflammation. actinomyces pyogenes and ahs showed opposite associations with mononuclear cell inflammation  and lymphocytic foci.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == insertional inactivation of the gene encoding a 76-kilodalton cell surface polypeptide in streptococcus gordonii challis has a pleiotropic effect on cell surface composition and properties.
AB  == a library of streptococcus gordonii dl1-challis dna was constructed in lambda gt11. phage plaques were screened for production of antigens that reacted with antiserum to s. gordonii cell surface proteins. a recombinant phage denoted lambda gt11-cp2 was isolated that carried 1.85 kb of s. gordonii dna and that expressed an antigen with a molecular mass of 29 kda in escherichia coli. antibodies that reacted with the expression product were affinity purified and were shown to react with a single polypeptide antigen with a molecular mass of 76 kda in s. gordonii dl1-challis. a segment (0.85 kb) of the cloned dna within the  transcription unit was ligated into a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an erythromycin resistance determinant and transformed into s. gordonii dl1-challis. the plasmid integrated onto the chromosome, and expression of the 76-kda polypeptide antigen was abolished. the gene inactivation had no obvious effect on bacterial growth or on a number of phenotypic properties, including hydrophobicity and adherence. however, it abolished serum-induced cell aggregation, mutant cells had reduced aggregation titers in saliva and in colostrum immunoglobulin a, and it also reduced coaggregation with some actinomyces species. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of cell envelope proteins from wild-type and mutant strains showed that  as well as lacking the surface-exposed 76-kda polypeptide, mutant cell envelopes  were deficient in several other polypeptides, including those that bound to immunoglobulin a. expression of the gene encoding the 76-kda polypeptide in s. gordonii appeared to be critical for functional conformation of the cell surface.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == nucleotide sequencing of the type 1 fimbrial subunit gene of actinomyces viscosus t14v revealed a consensus ribosome-binding site followed by an open reading frame of 1,599 nucleotides. the encoded protein of 533 amino acids (mr = 56,899) was predominantly hydrophilic except for an amino-terminal signal peptide and a carboxy-terminal region identified as a potential membrane-spanning segment. edman degradation of the cloned protein expressed in escherichia coli and the type 1 fimbriae of a. viscosus t14v showed that both began with alanine at position 31 of the deduced amino acid sequence. the amino acid compositions of the cloned protein and fimbriae also were comparable and in close agreement with  the composition of the deduced protein. the amino acid sequence of the a. viscosus t14v type 1 fimbrial subunit showed no significant global homology with  various other proteins, including the pilins of gram-negative bacteria. however,  34% amino acid sequence identity was noted between the type 1 fimbrial subunit of strain t14v and the type 2 fimbrial subunit of actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 (m. k. yeung and j. o. cisar, j. bacteriol. 170:3803-3809, 1988). this homology included several different conserved sequences of up to eight identical amino acids that were distributed in both the amino- and carboxy-terminal thirds of each actinomyces fimbrial subunit. these findings indicate that the different types of fimbriae on these gram-positive bacteria share a common ancestry.

AB  == a structural gene for type 1 fimbriae of streptococcus sanguis fw213 was located  within a 6-kilobase fragment cloned in escherichia coli. a 1.6-kilobase internal  fragment contains an open reading frame of 927 bases coding for an immunoreactive peptide of 34,349 daltons, which corresponds in size with an observed cytoplasmic form of fimbrial peptide (p. m. fives-taylor, f. l. macrina, t. j. pritchard, and s. j. peene, infect. immun. 55:123-128, 1987). disruption of the reading frame by insertional mutagenesis results in loss of immunoreactivity. consensus sequences  for initiation of transcription and translation were identified 5' to the coding  region. transcription terminator-like sequences were found downstream of the coding region. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned fimbrial peptide shows a strongly hydrophobic signal sequence at the amino terminus. the carboxyl-terminal region does not include a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence  such as has been reported for other gram-positive surface structures. a hydrophobic region of 12 to 14 amino acids downstream from the putative signal sequence cleavage site exhibits homology with the streptococcus pyogenes type 6 m protein repetitive region a (s. k. hollingshead, v. a. fischetti, and j. r. scott, j. biol. chem., 261:1677-1686, 1986). functional homology at the level of  protein secondary structure with actinomyces viscosus t14v type 1 fimbriae (m. k. yeung, b. m. chassy, and j. o. cisar, j. bacteriol., 169:1678-1683, 1987) is proposed.

TI  == [inducing effect of periodontopathic bacteria on activation of macrophage functions and production of interleukin-1 by mouse peritoneal macrophages].
AB  == periodontal disease is thought to be initiated by a bacterial infection and subsequently developed by immunopathological mechanisms thorough host-parasite interactions. the macrophage and lymphocyte are the major functional cell types in the lesion of the disease and participate in tissue destruction and alteration of the periodontal connective tissue as well as in host defense mechanisms. however, the detailed implications of macrophages in development of the disease is still unclear. the aim of this study was to gain more understanding of the functional role of macrophages in periodontal disease. in this study, we examined the inducing effects of sonicated extracts from some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria associated with the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, including bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, and actinomyces viscosus, on activation of macrophage functions and il-1 production by the macrophages from the mouse peritoneum. at a  dose as low as 1 microgram/ml (dry weight) sonicated extracts from b. gingivalis  induced an increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. a significant increase in the acid phosphatase and in glucose consumption was observed in the cultures at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after the addition of the sonicate. sonicated extracts from a. viscosus, a gram-positive bacterium, as well as b. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and h. actinomycetemcomitans, gram-negative ones, were able to induce the increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of the macrophages. these periodontopathic bacteria were found to strongly induce il-1 production by the macrophages as early as 24 h after addition of the sonicates. a significant increase in the il-1 production was observed at a dose of 1 microgram/ml of the sonicates. the inducing ability was equivalent to 1 microgram/ml escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the highest production of il-1  was observed in the macrophages treated with h. actinomycetemcomitans among these sonicates. sonicated extracts from both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  were able to induce the il-1 production by macrophages from c3h/hej mice, which are lps low-responders. these results suggest that periodontopathic bacteria have potent ability to induce macrophage activation and il-1 production and that the activated macrophages may play an important role in development of periodontal disease.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus t14v and streptococcus sanguis 34 depends on interaction of a lectin on a. viscosus t14v with a cell surface carbohydrate on s. sanguis 34. this carbohydrate was isolated, and its chemical makeup was established. the carbohydrate remained attached to s. sanguis 34 cells through extraction with triton x-100 and treatment with pronase. it was cleaved from the cell residue by autoclaving and purified by differential centrifugation  and column chromatography on deae-sephacel and sephadex g-75. the polysaccharide  contained phosphate which was neither inorganic nor monoester. treatment with naoh-nabh4, followed by escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, or with 48% hf at  4 degrees c, followed by nabh4, yielded inorganic phosphate and oligosaccharide alditols. therefore, the polysaccharide is composed of oligosaccharide units joined together by phosphodiester bridges. the structure and stereochemistry of the main oligosaccharide alditol was established previously (f. c. mcintire, c. a. bush, s.-s. wu, s.-c. li, y.-t. li, m. mcneil, s. tjoa, and p. v. fennessey, carbohydr. res. 166:133-143). permethylation analysis, 1h and 31p nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the whole polysaccharide revealed the position of the phosphodiester linkages. the polysaccharide is mainly a polymer of (6) galnac(alpha 1-3)rha(beta 1-4)glc(beta 1-6)galf(beta 1-6)galnac(beta 1- 3)gal(alpha 1)-opo3. it reacted as a single antigen with antiserum to s. sanguis  34 cells and was a potent inhibitor of coaggregation between a. viscosus t14v and s. sanguis 34. quantitative inhibition of precipitation assays with oligosaccharides, o-allyl n-acetylgalactosaminides, and simple sugars indicated that specific antibodies were directed to the galnac end of the hexasaccharide unit. in contrast, coaggregation was inhibited much more effectively by saccharides containing betagalnac. thus, the specificity of the a. viscosus t14v  lectin is strikingly different from that of antibodies directed against the s. sanguis 34 polysaccharide.

TI  == molecular basis of bacterial adhesion in the oral cavity.
AB  == the two varieties of fimbriae identified on oral strains of actinomyces have distinct functional properties. the type 1 fimbriae of actinomyces viscosus t14v  mediate attachment to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. type 2 fimbriae--on a. viscosus and the only fimbriae detected on a. naeslundii wvu45--are associated with lectin activity. interaction of these fimbriae with complementary receptors  initiates bacterial attachment to streptococcus sanguis 34 and sialidase-treated  epithelial cells and the killing of actinomyces by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns). galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac), and related oligosaccharides inhibit these processes, and mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae do not participate in them. the actinomyces lectin is similar to lectins from ricinus communis and bauhinia purpurea that agglutinate certain strains of oral streptococci, block attachment of actinomyces to epithelial cells, and inhibit killing of actinomyces by pmns. the s. sanguis receptor for the actinomyces lectin comprises repeating hexasaccharide units with galnac termini. used as probes, the peanut agglutinin,  with specificity for gal(beta-3)galnac, and the lectin from b. purpurea detect a  160-kilodalton (kdal) band in sds-page-separated epithelial cell extracts and a 100-kdal band in pmn extracts. these may be receptors for type 2 fimbriae. a. viscosus genes encoding subunits of types 1 and 2 fimbriae have been cloned in escherichia coli; the type 1 subunit is 65 kdal and the type 2 subunit is 59 kdal. submandibular immunization of mice with a mixture of type 1 and type 2 fimbriae evokes the production of iga and igg antibodies in serum and saliva that inhibit in vitro adsorption of a. viscosus to sha. these antibodies may modulate  colonization of teeth by this organism.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms isolated from equine orthopedic patients.
AB  == positive cultures were obtained from 60 equine orthopedic cases during a 12 year  period (1974-1985). these cases consisted of 34 long or cuboidal bone fractures,  13 arthrotomy/arthroscopy procedures for removal or internal fixation of a fracture, 7 proximal splint bone fractures, and 6 facial or mandibular fractures. excluding the 13 arthrotomies, only 10 (21%) of the 47 were open fractures. multiple organisms were isolated from 36 cases (20 long or cuboidal bone fractures, 7 splint bone fractures, 5 mandibular fractures, and 4 intra-articular fractures). of the 142 isolates, 35 (24%) were members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 33 (23%) streptococcus spp., and 25 (18%) staphylococcus spp. with the majority being coagulase positive (65%). other organisms isolated were pseudomonas spp. (16, 11%), obligate anaerobes (11, 7%), and actinobacillus spp.  (7, 5%). the remaining 10% consisted of pasteurella spp., bacillus spp., corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp., and actinomyces spp. when comparing results between two time periods (1974-1979 and 1980-1985) there was an increase  in the percentage of coagulase positive staphylococci isolates resistant to all antimicrobics tested except oxacillin and amikacin, and escherichia coli isolates were resistant to all but amikacin. for pseudomonas spp., resistance to gentamicin increased in the second time period (1980-1986). during the initial time period (1974-1979) culture tests for obligate anerobes were not conducted until 1975. no anerobes were cultured during those initial 5 years; however, one  third of those isolated after 1980 were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cloning and expression of a type 1 fimbrial subunit of actinomyces viscosus t14v.
AB  == the type 1 fimbriae of actinomyces viscosus mediate the adherence of this organism to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. the gene encoding a putative subunit of this fimbrial adhesin was cloned in escherichia coli, and its product was examined. a. viscosus t14v chromosomal dna was partially restricted with sau3ai and cloned into e. coli jm109 by using the plasmid vector puc13. two clones, each containing a different dna insert with a common 4.1-kilobase region, reacted in colony immunoassays with specific polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies directed against a. viscosus t14v type 1 fimbriae. western blot analysis revealed the expression of a 65-kilodalton protein that migrated slightly behind an antigenically similar protein from native type 1 fimbriae. deletion analysis showed that the gene encoding the cloned protein was localized on a 1.9-kilobase  psti-bamhi fragment and that transcription was dependent on the lac promoter of the vector. the cloned fimbrial protein was purified from the e. coli cytoplasmic fraction by ion-exchange, immunoaffinity, and gel permeation chromatography. rabbit antibodies prepared against the cloned protein and against purified a. viscosus type 1 fimbriae gave similar patterns with partially dissociated type 1  fimbriae after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. the data therefore provide evidence that the gene cloned encodes  a subunit of this fimbrial adhesin.

AB  == a total of 312 samples collected from different organs and muscles of dead, disabled, diseased, dying, and normal carcasses of sheep were examined bacteriologically to determine the different species of microorganisms as to their public health significance. in addition, the aerobic plate count (apc) and  most probable number (mpn) coliform/g were determined of musculus biceps brachii, musculus quadriceps femoris, and musculus longissimus dorsi. the mean bacterial load was higher in summer than in winter in dead and in normal sheep. moreover, the apc was higher in winter 3 hours after slaughtering than after 24 h cooling.  the bacterial load decreased in that order in the muscles of dead, disabled, diseased, and dying sheep carcasses. the lowest bacterial load was recorded in the musculus longissimus dorsi. the most predominant isolates recovered from different organs and muscles were escherichia coli (60), staphylococci (33), proteus vulgaris (12), enterobacter aerogenes (11), corynebacterium ovis (9), alcaligenes faecalis (7), actinomyces israelii (5), citrobacter freundii (4), pneumococci (3), and enterococci (2). the importance is discussed of the isolated strains as zoonotic agents and for assessing the hygienic meat quality.

TI  == lectin-dependent attachment of actinomyces naeslundii to receptors on epithelial  cells.
AB  == the adherence of actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 to monolayer cultures of human epithelial cell lines was mediated by the lactose-sensitive fimbriae (type 2) of  strain wvu45. the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v, which has both types 1 and 2 fimbriae, was approximately half that of a. naeslundii, and only minimal attachment of a. naeslundii and a. viscosus mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae was detected. the adherence of strain wvu45 was enhanced two- to threefold by neuraminidase treatment of the epithelial cells. the fab fragments of antibodies  which recognize the type 2 fimbriae inhibited the adherence of a. naeslundii wvu45 to the epithelial cells. the bacterial interaction with epithelial cells was inhibited by lactose, methyl-beta-d-galactoside, and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, but not by methyl-alpha-d-galactoside, cellobiose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-fucose, or d-mannose. to further characterize the epithelial cell receptors for the bacterial lectin, we utilized several plant and invertebrate lectins as potential inhibitors of bacterial adherence. lectins from bauhinia purpurea and arachis hypogaea which recognize n-acetyl-d-galactosamine,  d-galactose, and d-galactose-beta-(1----3)-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine inhibited bacterial attachment, and binding of these lectins to epithelial cells was enhanced by the addition of neuraminidase. lectins reacting with alpha-linked d-galactose, alpha-linked n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, d-mannose, or sialic acid were not inhibitory. under similar assay conditions, adherence of a mannose-sensitive strain of escherichia coli was inhibited by concanavalin a but  not by the lectin from bauhinia purpurea. these results indicate that certain plant lectins have specificities similar to that of the actinomyces fimbrial lectin and are, therefore, useful probes for identifying receptors on epithelial  cells for certain bacteria.

AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  == lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (gtase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)c]sucrose. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to gtase. these cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than  did the cells of the remaining serotypes. lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to gtase than did the controls without added enzyme. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than  did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of gtase. lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. these results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated gtase does not create additional gtase binding sites in s. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the s. mutans strains after exposure to gtase. of these species, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. three mutant strains of s. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of gtase as the control. these results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of s. mutans. the results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than s. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free gtase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. the results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of s. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.

TI  == use of extractable adenosine triphosphate to estimate the viable cell mass in dental plaque samples obtained from monkeys.
AB  == the viable cell mass in plaque samples obtained from monkeys was estimated by determining the concentration of extractable adenosine triphosphate (atp), and total cell mass was estimated by measuring the protein content. the results were  expressed in terms of the specific atp and protein contents of streptococcus sanguis. the viable counts estimated by these techniques were comparable to or exceeded viable counts obtained by other investigators using conventional bacteriological methods.

TI  == lipids of the streptomycettes. structural investigation and biological interrelation a review.
AB  == during a systematic investigation of lipids of streptomycetes a series of compounds of biochemical and microbiological interest have been isolated and characterized. these include several menaquinones, glycosyl diglycerides (glucuronosyl and isoladobinosym diglycerides), two ornithino lipids and a diol phospholipid. some of these lipids were not known previously as constituents of streptomycete cells although they have been encountered elsewhere; others have proved to be novel lipids. the results of structural studies of these lipids are  reviewed and some of their possible biological functions are discussed.

AB  == pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. the effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.

AB  == the mutagenic effect of 21 new hydroxylamine derivatives was studied on biochemical mutants of escherichia coli p-678 and actinomyces rimosus 222. the iver--szybalsky method was used for the preliminary selection of mutagens. dose-effect curves were plotted for the most efficient mutagens. among the compounds studied 4 hydroxylamine derivatives were observed to have a mutagenic effect. the most efficient among them proved to be 0-(4-metoxybenzyl)-hydroxylamine and 0-(gamma-chlorocrotyl) hydroxylamine that induced reversions in the threonine locus of e. coli p-678 and in the lysine locus of act. rimosus 222, being more efficient than hydroxylamine, the generally known mutagen. the dependence of the mutagenic activity of the compounds studied  on their chemical structure is investigated.

AB  == action spectra for photoreactivation (light-induced recovery from ultraviolet radiation injury) of escherichia coli b/r and streptomyces griseus atcc 3326 were determined. the spectral region explored was 365 to 700 mmicro. the action spectrum for s. griseus differed from that for e. coli, indicating that the chromophores absorbing reactivating energy in the two species were not the same.  reactivation of s. griseus occurred in the region 365 mmicro (the shortest wave length studied) to about 500 mmicro, with the most effective wave length lying near 436 mmicro. this single sharp peak in the spectrum at 436 mmicro suggested the soret band typical of porphyrins. reactivation of e. coli occurred in the region 365 to about 470 mmicro, with the most active wave length lying near 375 mmicro. the single, non-pronounced peak near 375 was probably not due to a soret  band, and the identification of the substance absorbing reactivating light in e.  coli is uncertain. in neither species was the region 500 to 700 mmicro active. the implications of these action spectra and their differences are discussed.
