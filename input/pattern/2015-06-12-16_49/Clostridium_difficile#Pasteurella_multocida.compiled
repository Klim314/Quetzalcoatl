TI  - Characterization of the membrane-targeting C1 domain in Pasteurella multocida toxin.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is a virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of some forms of pasteurellosis. The toxin activates G(q)- and G(12/13)-dependent pathways through the deamidation of a glutamine residue in the alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases. We recently reported the crystal structure of the C terminus (residues 575-1285) of PMT (C-PMT), which is composed of three domains (C1, C2, and C3), and that the C1 domain is involved in the localization of C-PMT to the plasma membrane, and the C3 domain possesses a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad. In this study, we analyzed the membrane-targeting function of the C1 domain in detail. The C1 domain consists of seven helices of which the first four (residues 590-670), showing structural similarity to the N terminus of Clostridium difficile toxin B, were found to be involved in the recruitment of C-PMT to the plasma membrane. C-PMT lacking these helices (C-PMT DeltaC1(4H)) neither localized to the plasma membrane nor stimulated the G(q/12/13)-dependent signaling pathways. When the membrane-targeting property was complemented by a peptide tag with an N-myristoylation motif, C-PMT DeltaC1(4H) recovered the PMT activity. Direct binding between the C1 domain and liposomes containing phospholipids was evidenced by surface plasmon resonance analyses. These results indicate that the C1 domain of C-PMT functions as a targeting signal for the plasma membrane.
TI  - Crystal structures reveal a thiol protease-like catalytic triad in the C-terminal region of Pasteurella multocida toxin.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT), one of the virulence factors produced by the bacteria, exerts its toxicity by up-regulating various signaling cascades downstream of the heterotrimeric GTPases Gq and G12/13 in an unknown fashion. Here, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal region (residues 575-1,285) of PMT, which carries an intracellularly active moiety. The overall structure of C-terminal region of PMT displays a Trojan horse-like shape, composed of three domains with a "feet"-,"body"-, and "head"-type arrangement, which were designated C1, C2, and C3 from the N to the C terminus, respectively. The C1 domain, showing marked similarity in steric structure to the N-terminal domain of Clostridium difficile toxin B, was found to lead the toxin molecule to the plasma membrane. The C3 domain possesses the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad that is organized only when the Cys is released from a disulfide bond. The steric alignment of the triad corresponded well to that of papain or other enzymes carrying Cys-His-Asp. PMT toxicities on target cells were completely abrogated when one of the amino acids constituting the triad was mutated. Our results indicate that PMT is an enzyme toxin carrying the cysteine protease-like catalytic triad dependent on the redox state and functions on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane of target cells.
TI  - Development of a toxA gene knock-out mutant of Pasteurella multocida and evaluation of its protective effects.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is an important veterinary and opportunistic human pathogen. In particular, strains of P. multocida serogroup D cause progressive atrophic rhinitis, and produce a potent, intracellular, mitogenic toxin known as P. multocida toxin (PMT), which is encoded by the toxA gene. To further investigate the toxigenic and pathogenic effects of PMT, a toxA-deleted mutant was developed by homologous gene recombination. When administrated to mice, the toxigenicity of the toxA mutant P. multocida was drastically reduced, suggesting that the PMT contributes the major part of the toxigenicity of P. multocida. Similar results were obtained in a subsequent experiment, while high mortalities were observed when toxA(+) P. multocida bacterial culture or culture lysate were administrated. Mice immunized with toxA(-) P. multocida were not protected (none survived) following challenge with toxA(+) P. multocida or bacterial culture lysate (toxin). These results suggest that the toxigenicity of P. multocida is mainly derived from PMT.
TI  - Prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in Ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  - Visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across Ontario. Between May and July 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. One specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. All dogs were judged to be in good health. Zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. The primary pathogen was Clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. Seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase E. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the genus Salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. Pasteurella multocida or Pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. Giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while Toxocara canis and Ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Campylobacter spp., Microsporum canis, group A streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. Further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.
TI  - Signalling components involved in the coupling of alpha 1-adrenoceptors to phospholipase D in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.
AB  - Activation of phospholipase D (PLD) is assumed to be one major pathway by which alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (alpha(1)ARs) induce hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes. Heterotrimeric G proteins, protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, protein tyrosine kinases, monomeric GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and Rho families, and as important cofactor phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) seem to participate in the G protein-coupled receptor dependent regulation of PLD. We therefore studied the role of these components in the coupling of alpha(1)ARs to PLD in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM). Stimulation of alpha(1)ARs, most likely of the alpha(1A) subtype, by noradrenaline increased PLD activity three- to fourfold concomitant with the stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC). In contrast, the partial agonist phenylephrine stimulated PLC, but failed to increase PLD activity. The PLC and PLD responses were pertussis toxin insensitive and treatment of the cells with the G(q)-activating toxin of Pasteurella multocida stimulated both phospholipases about fourfold. Over-expression of the G(q)-and G(i)-type-specific regulator of G protein signalling RGS4 blunted alpha(1)AR-induced PLC and PLD stimulation. Ro 31-8220, known to inhibit Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent PKC isoforms, strongly inhibited PLD activity, whereas Go 6976, known to inhibit preferentially Ca(2+)-dependent PKC isozymes, was without effect. The ARF signalling inhibitor brefeldin A, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the Rho-inactivating toxin B of Clostridium difficile blunted alpha(1)AR-induced PLD stimulation and largely reduced the cellular PIP(2) content. In membranes of toxin B-treated NCRM, PLD activity was similarly reduced, but was fully restored by addition of exogenous PIP(2). We conclude, that alpha(1A)ARs stimulate PLD activity via a G(q/11)-PLCbeta-novel PKC isoform-dependent pathway in NRCM. ARF and Rho GTPases as well as protein tyrosine kinases contribute to PLD stimulation in NRCM, most likely by regulating the supply of PIP(2).
