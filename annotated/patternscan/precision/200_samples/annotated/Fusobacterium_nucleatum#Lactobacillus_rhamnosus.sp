TI == bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI == effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB == purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. materials and methods: biofilms of six bacterial species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs according to the zurich biofilm model. xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. at the end of their designated incubation times, some ha discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific media. after a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. results: clsm images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of ha discs. culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. conclusions: xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. this study shows that xylitol is not only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.

TI == oral adhesion and survival of probiotic and other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB == introduction: most probiotic products are consumed orally and hence it is feasible that the bacteria in these products may also attach to oral surfaces; however, the effects of these bacteria on the oral ecosystem are mostly unknown. our aim was to evaluate the oral colonization potential of different probiotic, dairy, and fecal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains in vitro. methods: the binding of 17 lactobacillus and seven bifidobacterium strains to hydroxyapatite and microtitre wells coated with human saliva was tested. binding of selected strains to human buccal epithelial cells and co-adherence with fusobacterium nucleatum were also investigated. in addition, the survival in sterilized human whole saliva was examined. results: there was a large variation in binding to saliva-coated surfaces and buccal epithelial cells but all strains survived in saliva. the binding pattern of the probiotics did not differ from the binding of the fecal strains. f. nucleatum altered the binding of both the low-binding bifidobacteria and the high-binding lactobacilli. conclusion: the differences in binding in vitro may indicate that there are also differences in the persistence of the different probiotic strains in the oral cavity in vivo.

TI == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and 16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI == antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB == microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain, alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.

TI == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.
