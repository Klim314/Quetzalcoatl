TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == bacterial toxins induce sustained mrna expression of the silencing transcription  factor klf2 via inactivation of rhoa and rhophilin 1.
AB  == yersiniae bearing the yersinia virulence plasmid pyv impact the transcriptome of  j774a.1 macrophage-like cells in two distinct ways: (i) by suppressing, in a yersinia outer protein p (yopp)-dependent manner, the induction of inflammatory response genes and (ii) by mrna induction of the silencing transcription factor klf2. here we show that klf2 induction by yersinia enterocolitica occurs in several cell lines of macrophage and squamous and upper gastrointestinal epithelial origin as well as in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. several strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are equally effective as y. enterocolitica in inducing klf2 expression. screening of mutant strains or  incubation with recombinant toxins identified the rho-inactivating toxins yopt from yersinia spp., exos from pseudomonas aeruginosa, edin-b from staphylococcus  aureus, and c3bot from clostridium botulinum as bacterial inducers of klf2 mrna.  klf2 mrna induction by these toxins does not require de novo protein synthesis. serum response factor or actin depolymerization does not seem to be involved in regulating klf2 expression in response to bacterial infection. instead, short hairpin rna-mediated inactivation of rhoa and its effector rhophilin 1 is sufficient to induce long-term klf2 expression. thus, bacteria exploit the rhoa-rhophilin signaling cascade to mediate sustained expression of the immunosuppressive transcription factor klf2.

TI  == [microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in costa rica].
AB  == microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in costa rica. unrefined cristalised cane sugar, obtained after the filtration and evaporation of sugar cane juice, is a nutritional product of traditional consumption in costa rica and other neotropical countries. it has been used in the topic treatment of infected  wounds, with satisfactory results even with some antibiotic-ressistant bacteria.  we studied the microbiological quality of 50 commercial samples. the analyses included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria plate count; aerobic and anaerobic  spore count; mold and yeast count; total and fecal coliforms; and presence of clostridium botulinum. the antimicrobial effect was tested for staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), s. epidermidis (ucr 2902), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enteritidis (atcc 13076), listeria monocytogenes (atcc 19116) and aspergillus niger (asni 06). most of the  samples (76%) presented counts lower than 100 cfu/g especially for sporulated forms (90% lower than 20 cfu/g), the mold and yeast count was higher (38% higher  than 10(2) cfu/g), demonstrating the importance of these microorganisms in the spoilage of the product; 76% of the samples presented fecal contamination; c. botulinum was not isolated with the methodology employed. no inhibitory effect was observed for a. niger, but all samples han an inhibitory effect over the other species, especially for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

TI  == extracting survival parameters from isothermal, isobaric, and "iso-concentration" inactivation experiments by the "3 end points method".
AB  == theoretically, if an organism's resistance can be characterized by 3 survival parameters, they can be found by solving 3 simultaneous equations that relate the final survival ratio to the lethal agent's intensity. (for 2 resistance parameters, 2 equations will suffice.) in practice, the inevitable experimental scatter would distort the results of such a calculation or render the method unworkable. averaging the results obtained with more than 3 final survival ratio  triplet combinations, determined in four or more treatments, can remove this impediment. this can be confirmed by the ability of a kinetic inactivation model  derived from the averaged parameters to predict survival patterns under conditions not employed in their determination, as demonstrated with published isothermal survival data of clostridium botulinum spores, isobaric data of escherichia coli under hpp, and pseudomonas exposed to hydrogen peroxide. both the method and the underlying assumption that the inactivation followed a weibull-log logistic (well) kinetics were confirmed in this way, indicating that  when an appropriate survival model is available, it is possible to predict the entire inactivation curves from several experimental final survival ratios alone. where applicable, the method could simplify the experimental procedure and lower  the cost of microbial resistance determinations. in principle, the methodology can be extended to deteriorative chemical reactions if they too can be characterized by 2 or 3 kinetic parameters.

TI  == [evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella  enteritidis, listeria monocytogenes and aspergillus niger. evaluation of its microbiological charge].
AB  == the evaluation of the microbiological charge present in costa rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. the microbiological charge of  25 honey samples, acquired in costa rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg  yolk agar in order to determine the presence of clostridium botulinum. for the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in muller hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), staphylococcus epidermidis (ucr 2902), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 9027), escherichia coli (atcc25922), salmonella enteritidis (atcc 13076), listeria monocytogenes (atcc 19116) and aspergillus niger. the results obtained for the microbiological characterization  of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) cfu/g. no positive result was obtained for the isolation of c. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of s. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, a. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.

TI  == bacterial toxins inhibiting or activating small gtp-binding proteins.
AB  == amino acids located on the switch 1 or switch 2 domains of small gtpases of the ras and rho family are targets of several bacterial toxins. exoenzyme c3 from clostridium botulinum adp-ribosylates specifically rho at r43 and prevents the recruitment of rho on the cell membrane. this blocks the downstream effects of the rho gtpase. however, exoenzyme c3 is not a toxin, and chimeric proteins fusing c3 with the b moiety of either diphtheria toxin or pseudomonas aeruginosa  exotoxin a have been produced to intoxicate cells with low concentration of c3. c. difficile toxin b modifies by glucosylation rho on t37 and rac and cdc42 on t35. glucosylation of rho, rac, and cdc42 blocks the binding of these gtpases on  their downstream effectors. c. sordellii lethal toxin modifies ras, rap, and rac  on t35 by glucosylation. cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), from uropathogenic escherichia coli strains, deamidates q63 of rho into e63, thereby blocking the intrinsic or gap-mediated gtpase of rho. this allows permanent activation of rho. thus, rho gtpases are targets for three different toxin activities. molecular mechanisms of these toxins are discussed.

TI  == in vitro activity of sulphimidazole alone and in association with trimethoprim against enteric pathogens.
AB  == sulphimidazole is a new sulphonamide belonging to the class of intestinal sulphonamides and characterized by the fact that it is active even in vitro. it has the heterocyclic ring of 5-nitroimidazoles on amidic nitrogen. its antibacterial activity is similar to that of the classical sulphonamides but differs in that it also combats certain anaerobic bacteria such as clostridium botulinum. this effect is completely absent in the case of sulphadiazine and sulphamethoxazole. also, since p-amino-benzene-sulphonamide is present in the molecule, the drug acts in synergism with trimethoprim against certain aerobic or facultative strains of enteric pathogens.

TI  == the propagation of feline panleukopenia virus in micro-carrier cell culture and use of the inactivated virus in the protection of mink against viral enteritis.
AB  == using microcarrier cell culture for the production of virus antigen, a formalin-inactivated feline panleukopenia virus vaccine was evaluated for protection of mink against specific mink enteritis virus infection. the vaccine showed a good immunogenic effect in mink when used either alone or in combination with clostridium botulinum type c-toxoid and/or pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine. a single vaccination induced persistent immune responses for periods of at least 1  year, as evaluated by elisa and challenge tests. neither immunological interference between vaccine constituents nor adverse reactions were observed.

TI  == [recent advances in the molecular mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, in particular of diphtheria, cholera, coli, botulinum and shigella toxins as well as tetanospasmin and the toxins of staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. proportions of toxins of corynebacterium diphtheriae and of pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the nad and adp-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. the cholera toxin and the l-toxin from escherichia coli have a similar structure. they transfer an adp-ribose portion from nad to the gtp-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the gtpase activity is reduced. the increase of the camp content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. the tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. the botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.

TI  == inhibition of protease production of various bacteria by ammonium salts: its effect on toxin production and virulence.
AB  == production of protease by many bacteria was found to be inhibited by ammonium salts, and the enzyme production was more sensitive to the salts than was growth  of the organisms. inhibition of protease production by some pathogenic bacteria may result in the recognition of an exotoxin which otherwise would have been digested by the protease. in the case of pseudomonas aeruginosa, qualitatively different toxicities could be demonstrated in the culture fluids, depending on the presence or absence of protease in such a fluid. the toxicity of the culture  in the presence of a high titer of protease may be due primarily to the protease, whereas the toxicity exhibited in the absence of protease could be due to proteinacious exotoxin. producers of high titers of protease tended to be less virulent in vivo than producers of low titers of the enzyme, which exert their toxicities by a separate exotoxin.

TI  == collagenolytic activity of bacteria.
AB  == actively growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were screened by a plate assay, with reconstituted guinea pig collagen as a substrate, for their ability to produce a collagenolytic factor. collagenolytic activity was not demonstrated among the aerobic organisms tested, with the exception of one strain of staphylococcus aureus (only when grown under anaerobic conditions). collagenolytic activity, however, was detected in cultures of clostridium tetani  and bacteroides species other than b. melaninogenicus. collagenolytic activity of these organisms could be confirmed by measuring the amount of hydroxyproline liberated from the collagen gel during growth. although collagenase production by pseudomonas aeruginosa has been suggested in previous reports, our results were negative. an extracellular fraction of p. aeruginosa was able to hydrolyze a synthetic hexapeptide cbz-glycyl-l-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-l-prolyl-l- alanine, but  was without detectable effect on reconstituted collagen.
