TI  - Characterization of the Tet M determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus ducreyi, Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Veillonella parvula had DNA sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the Tet M transposon, Tn916. In contrast, Gardnerella vaginalis, commensal Neisseria spp., and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.
