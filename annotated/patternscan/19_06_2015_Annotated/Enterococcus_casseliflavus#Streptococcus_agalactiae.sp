TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
