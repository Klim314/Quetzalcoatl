effect of beta -glucanase and xylanase supplementation of barley- and rye-based diets on caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
1. the aim was to investigate the effect of grain type (barley or rye) and exogenous enzymes (beta-glucanase or xylanase) on the composition of chicken caecal microbiota as examined by classical culturing and molecular techniques (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (fish) and terminal-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (t-rflp)). 2. plate counting revealed higher total numbers of anaerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in caecal contents of birds fed with rye-based diets than in birds fed with barley-based diets. 3. as assessed by fish analysis, the most abundant bacterial groups in the broiler caeca were clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale followed by bacteroides sp., lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp., bifidobacterium sp. and enterobacteriaceae. for both cereal types, the enzyme supplementation significantly decreased the relative amount of enterobacteriaceae. 4. the t-rflp profiles indicated that the caecal microbiota of birds receiving rye-based diets was more diverse than that of birds fed on barley-based diets. 5. irrespective of the method applied, the results indicate that the cereal type as well as the exogenous enzyme supplementation influence the microbiota in broiler chicken caeca, and may have the effect of reducing potentially pathogenic enterobacteriaceae populations.
bacteriophage treatment significantly reduces viable clostridium difficile and prevents toxin production in an in vitro model system.
clostridium difficile is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, causing thousands of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the uk each year. in this study, we used a batch fermentation model of a c. difficile colonised system to evaluate the potential of a prophylactic and a remedial bacteriophage treatment regime to control the pathogen. it is shown that the prophylaxis regime was effective at preventing the growth of c. difficile (p = <0.001) and precluded the production of detectable levels of toxins a and b. the remedial treatment regime caused a less profound and somewhat transient decrease in the number of viable c. difficile cells (p = <0.0001), but still resulted in a lower level of toxin production relative to the control. the numbers of commensal bacteria including total aerobes and anaerobes, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp., lactobacillus sp., total clostridium sp., and enterobacteriaceae were not significantly decreased by this therapy, whereas significant detrimental effects were observed with metronidazole treatment. our study indicates that phage therapy has potential to be used for the control of c. difficile; it highlights the main benefits of this approach, and some future challenges.
