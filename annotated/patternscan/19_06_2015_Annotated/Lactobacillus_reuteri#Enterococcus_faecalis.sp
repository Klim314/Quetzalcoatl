TI  == a novel method for screening of potential probiotics for high adhesion capability.
AB  == to screen for potential probiotics with high adhesion capability, a chemostat model-based cultured human feces and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were applied, and the adhesion capability of the isolates was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. lactobacillus plantarum (hm218749), lactobacillus reuteri (eu547310), and enterococcus faecalis (hm218543) were isolated from the slime on  the chemostat wall, as these organisms could grow better at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic environment and could resist harsh conditions (ph 1.5 and 0.30% bile salt). lactobacillus plantarum, l. reuteri, and e. faecalis could adhere to ht-29 cells and reduce the adhesion of shigella dysenteriae 2457, staphylococcus cowan1, enterobacter sakazakii 45401, and escherichia coli 44102 to ht-29 cells.  moreover, the animal experiment showed that l. plantarum could adhere to mice intestine, increasing the number of lactobacilli and decreasing the number of enterococci.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == gassericin a: a circular bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == during the recent years extensive efforts have been made to find out bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (lab) active against various food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, and superior stabilities against heat treatments and ph variations. bacteriocins isolated from lab have been grouped into four classes. circular bacteriocins which were earlier grouped among the four groups of bacteriocins, have recently been proposed to be classified into a different class, making it class v bacteriocins. circular bacteriocins are special molecules, whose precursors must be post translationally modified to join the n to c termini with a head-to-tail peptide bond. cyclization appears to make them less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, high temperature and ph, and, therefore, provides enhanced stability as compared to linear bacteriocins. the advantages of circularization are also reflected by the fact that a significant number of macrocyclic natural products have found pharmaceutical applications. circular bacteriocins were unknown two decades ago, and even to date, only a few  circular bacteriocins from a diverse group of gram positive organisms have been reported. the first example of a circular bacteriocin was enterocin as-48, produced by enterococcus faecalis as-48. gassereccin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, reutericin 6 produced by lactobacillus reuteri la6 and circularin a, produced by clostridium beijerinickii atcc 25,752, are further examples of this group of antimicrobial peptides. in the present scenario, gassericin a can be an important tool in the food preservation owing to its properties of high ph  and temperature tolerance and the fact that it is produced by lab l. gasseri, whose many strains are proven probiotic.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == effects of potato fiber and potato-resistant starch on biomarkers of colonic health in rats fed diets containing red meat.
AB  == the effects of red meat consumption with and without fermentable carbohydrates on indices of large bowel health in rats were examined. sprague-dawley rats were fed cellulose, potato fiber, or potato-resistant starch diets containing 12% casein for 2 wk, then similar diets containing 25% cooked beef for 6 wk. after week 8, cecal and colonic microbiota composition, fermentation end-products, colon structure, and colonocyte dna damage were analyzed. rats fed potato fiber had lower bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group compared to other diet groups. colonic bifidobacterium spp. and/or lactobacillus spp. were higher in potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets than in the cellulose diet. beneficial changes were observed in short-chain fatty acid concentrations (acetic, butyric,  and propionic acids) in rats fed potato fiber compared with rats fed cellulose. phenol and p-cresol concentrations were lower in the cecum and colon of rats fed  potato fiber. an increase in goblet cells per crypt and longer crypts were found  in the colon of rats fed potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets. fermentable carbohydrates had no effect on colonic dna damage. dietary combinations of red meat with potato fiber or potato-resistant starch have distinctive effects in the large bowel. future studies are essential to examine the efficacy of different types of nondigestible carbohydrates in maintaining colonic health during long-term consumption of high-protein diets. practical application: improved understanding of interactions between the food consumed and gut microbiota provides knowledge needed to make healthier food choices for large bowel health. the impact of red meat on large bowel health may be ameliorated by  consuming with fermentable dietary fiber, a colonic energy source that produces less harmful by-products than the microbial breakdown of colonic protein for energy. developing functional red meat products with fermentable dietary fiber could be one way to promote a healthy and balanced macronutrient diet.

TI  == exploring optimization parameters to increase ssdna recombineering in lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == single-stranded dna (ssdna) recombineering is a technology which is used to make  subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. cells which express a single-stranded dna binding protein (rect or bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent  mechanism. by in silico analysis we identified ssdna binding protein homologs in  the genus lactobacillus and lactococcus lactis. to assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in lactobacillus reuteri atcc pta 6475 we expressed several rect homologs in this strain. rect derived from enterococcus faecalis crmen 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native rect protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. we successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in l. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (ptos). surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor pto linkages enhanced recombineering in l. reuteri 6475. to emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of l. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssdna recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.

TI  == ileal microbiota of growing pigs fed different dietary calcium phosphate levels and phytase content and subjected to ileal pectin infusion.
AB  == two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary p and ca levels, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on changes in bacterial populations in the ileum and on ileal and fecal fermentation patterns. growing pigs (bw 30.1 +/- 1.3 kg) were fitted with simple t-cannulas at the distal ileum and were fed a low-p corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of p/kg), or the control diet supplemented with either 15 g of monocalcium phosphate (mcp)/kg (exp. 1) or 1,000 phytase units of phytase/kg (exp. 2). daily infusion treatments consisted of either 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 l of demineralized water or 1.8 l of demineralized water as a control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. in each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double incomplete 4 x 2 latin square design. the dietary treatments in exp. 1 were the control diet with water infusion, the control diet with pectin infusion, the mcp diet with water infusion, or the mcp diet with pectin infusion. in exp. 2, the pigs received the same control treatments as in exp. 1 and the phytase diet in combination with water or pectin  infusion. gene copy numbers of total bacteria, lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus  reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus/lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus mucosae, enterococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacteria, the clostridium coccoides cluster, the clostridium leptum cluster, the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group, and enterobacteriaceae were determined by quantitative pcr in dna extracts of ileal digesta. in exp. 1, addition of mcp  reduced ileal gene copy numbers of enterococcus spp. (p = 0.048), e. faecium (p = 0.015), and the c. leptum cluster (p = 0.028), whereas pectin infusion enhanced (p = 0.008) ileal d-lactate concentration. in exp. 2, supplemental phytase led to greater ileal gene copy numbers of the c. coccoides (p = 0.041) and c. leptum (p  = 0.048) clusters and the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group (p = 0.033),  whereas it reduced (p = 0.027) fecal n-butyrate concentration. pectin infusion reduced (p = 0.005) ileal gene copy number of the c. leptum cluster. in conclusion, ileal bacterial populations and fermentation patterns are susceptible to changes in the intestinal availability of ca and p as well as to the supply of pectin as a fermentable substrate. greater intestinal ca availability decreased the numbers of some gram-positive bacteria, whereas greater p availability in the small intestine caused by phytase activity enhanced the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == change of intestinal microbiota with elemental diet and its impact on therapeutic effects in a murine model of chronic colitis.
AB  == elemental diet (ed) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for crohn's disease. however, the precise mechanisms of ed remain unclear. in interleukin-10  (il-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ed using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ed. ed significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. the total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ed. t-rflp profiles of the ed group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. the diversity of bacterial species in the ed group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. lactobacillus reuteri and l. johnsonii decreased and  enterococcus faecalis and e. durans increased in the ed group. the culture supernatant of l. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and il-6 activity in raw 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of e. faecalis and e. durans barely induced their activity. these data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ed seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria from poultry feces: evidence on anti-campylobacter and anti-listeria activities.
AB  == forty-five strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from poultry feces sampled from an industrial farm located in the nantes area (france), and most of  them belong to the streptococcus or lactobacillus genus according to the results  obtained by galerie api and molecular methods. the most representative lactic acid bacteria strains were screened for antibacterial compound production against 2 indicator organisms (listeria innocua f and campylobacter jejuni 11168) by means of the agar diffusion test. strain s37, identified as enterococcus faecalis, exhibited a clear anti-listerial activity and a slight anti-campylobacter activity, whereas strain s42, identified as lactobacillus reuteri, exhibited only anti-campylobacter activity. regarding the results of proteolytic, heat, and neutralizing treatments of supernatants from the aforementioned strains, we can conclude that antagonism observed is attributed to antimicrobial peptide or bacteriocin in the case of strain s37, whereas it is ascribable to a nonbacteriocin, likely a reuterin, in the case of strain s42.

TI  == genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. in general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. several circular antibacterial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin as-48, from enterococcus faecalis s-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin a, from lactobacillus gasseri la39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from lactobacillus reuteri la6, butyrivibriocin ar10, from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10, uberolysin, from  streptococcus uberis, circularin a, from clostridium beijerinckii atcc 25752, and subtilosin a, from bacillus subtilis. we summarize here the progress made in the  understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.

TI  == biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive lab and bifidobacteria (bf) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and streptococcus. the lab and bf isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on sds-page protein profile analysis of whole cells. furthermore, partial 16s rdna sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. the identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus lactobacillus  (78.8%), seven species to the genus bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus enterococcus (11.6%), one species of streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). in particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were l. reuteri, l. animalis, and l. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. besides these, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. the sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the ddbj and the similarity was above 97.2%. their partial 16s rrna genes were registered in the ddbj.

TI  == differential inflammatory mediator response in vitro from murine macrophages to lactobacilli and pathogenic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - ibd) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. certain intestinal bacterial strains  may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. in this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10(high), il-6(low), il-12p70(low)). conversely, e. faecalis and e. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic ibd. macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ros in response to all lactobacillus strains tested, while e. coli and e. faecalis ability to induce generation of ros was negligible. in contrast to ros, the production of no/no(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of ho-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. the beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of ibd are discussed.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  == germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (il-10 ko) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) after they were colonized with a pure culture of enterococcus faecalis. e. faecalis not only induced ibd (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the il-10 ko mice. conventional (complex-intestinal flora) il-10 ko mice developed ibd within 10 to  15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with e. faecalis-induced ibd in gnotobiotic il-10 ko mice. conversely, neither germ-free il-10 mice nor il-10 ko mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of candida albicans, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, l. reuteri, l. acidophilus, a bifidobacterium sp., lactococcus lactis, or a bacillus sp. developed ibd during the 25- to 30-week study. e. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger ibd, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of food-borne pathogens to caco-2 cells by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == aims: to select adhesive strains among strains of lactobacillus and to apply them to inhibit adhesion of food-borne pathogens. methods and results: twelve lactobacillus strains (10 from intestine) were examined for adhesion using caco-2 cell cultures. the two most adhesive strains, lactobacillus crispatus jcm 8779 and lact. reuteri jcm 1081, were used to test antiadhesion activity against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and enterococcus faecalis strains. adhesion of the pathogens was inhibited by both lactobacillus strains. adhesion of ent. faecalis was especially strongly inhibited by jcm 8779. although antimicrobial activity was not detected in the culture supernatant fluid by agar well diffusion assay, the supernatant fluid obtained from the harvested jcm 8779 cell suspension showed bactericidal activity against ent. faecalis. conclusion: the strong antiadhesion activity of jcm 8779 against ent. faecalis appears to be due to the combined effect of both bactericidal activity and competition for attachment site. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report that lact. crispatus produces a bactericidal substance.

TI  == characterization of reutericyclin produced by lactobacillus reuteri lth2584.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity  and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis  of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts  and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a  novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.

TI  == purification and characterization of a surface-binding protein from lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 that inhibits adhesion of enterococcus faecalis 1131.
AB  == lactobacilli have been shown to be important in the maintenance of the healthy urogenital flora. one strain, lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, releases surface-active components which can inhibit adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria. using a quantitative method for determining inhibition of adhesion, a protein with high anti-adhesive properties against enterococcus faecalis 1131 was purified. the n-terminal sequence of the 29-kda protein was identical to that of  a collagen-binding protein from lactobacillus reuteri ncib 11951, and exhibited close homology with a basic surface protein from l. fermentum br11. the results suggest that this anti-adhesive cell surface protein of lactobacillus could protect against uropathogens by preventing their adhesion. the federation of european microbiological societies.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == characterization of the bacterial flora of sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  == the microflora of a sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. the dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5)  cfu g-1. the spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum and lact. reuteri. the total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the ph dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. in this phase, only the latter two species remained dominant  in a ratio of 1:1. from the sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. sequence comparison of partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. five strains were classified as lact. vaginalis and could be regarded  as heterogeneous biovars of this species. the other two strains could be assigned to lact. helveticus. rapd-pcr and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  == molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pgt633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermgt) from lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pgt633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) type b antibiotics. the restriction endonucleases acci, bamhi, bcli, ecori, ecorv, hhai, hindii, hpai, kpni, sali, and sspi were employed to establish a physical map of pgt633. next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of  pgt633. the results revealed that pgt633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including bacillus subtilis bd170, streptococcus sanguis dl1, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several lactobacillus  spp. a 2.2 kb bamhi fragment of pgt633 containing the genetic determinant (ermgt) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into escherichia coli. determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermgt revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermc gene from s. aureus plasmid pe194. the leader sequences of  ermgt and ermc were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.

TI  == [effects of heat treated cells of intestinal lactic acid bacteria in rats fed a deoxycholic acid diet].
AB  == effects of the administration of heat treated cells of intestinal lactic acid bacteria were examined in rats fed a deoxycholic acid (dca) diet. male wistar rats were given a 0.25% dca diet with or without the heat treated cells of enterococcus faecalis ad 1001 (efh-1) or lactobacillus reuteri ad 0002 (lrh-2) for 4 weeks. abnormal increases in serum got, gpt, un and lipoproteins were observed in the rats fed the dca diet. furthermore, severe lesions in the kidney  as well as in the liver were found in these rats. on the contrary, the increases  in serum got, un, vldl and ldl were significantly suppressed, and markedly fewer  lesions in the liver and the kidney were observed in the rats fed the dca diet plus efh-1 or lrh-2.

TI  == in vivo transfer of pam beta 1 from lactobacillus reuteri to enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == trials were conducted to determine the in vivo transferability of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance between two strains of enteric gram-positive bacteria. germ-free mice were associated with the donor lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 strain, carrying the broad host range pam beta 1  plasmid, and with the enterococcus faecalis jh2ss recipient strain. analysis of faecal content of associated mice demonstrated that the in vivo transfer of this  plasmid did occur and that frequencies of conjugation were affected by the presence of subtherapeutic levels of antibiotic in the diet.
