TI  == halotolerance and survival kinetics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from jalapeno pepper (capsicum annuum l.) fermentation.
AB  == the microbiota associated with spontaneous fermentation of vegetables in a saline substrate may represent an important group of bacteria in the food industry. in this work, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, and leuconostoc citreum were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. in addition, entophytic bacteria such as pantoea eucalypti, pantoea anthophila, enterobacter cowanii, and enterobacter  asburiae were detected, but they were irrelevant for the fermentation process and were inhibited after 12 h of fermentation when the ph decreased from 6.5 to 4.9.  moreover, 2 species of yeast were isolated and identified as hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii and kodamaea ohmeri by their partial 26s rrna gene sequence. the growth of lab was evaluated at different sodium chloride contents. l. citreum was the most halotolerant species followed by l. plantarum and w. cibaria with a  concentration index to obtain a 50% population reduction (ic(50)) of 7.2%, 6.6%,  and 5.2%, respectively. furthermore, the growth of lab and escherichia coli o157:h7 was evaluated in the presence of the main phenylpropanoids from chilli peppers such as p-coumaric and ferulic acid. it was determined that lab can grow  in both acids at 4 mm, unlike e. coli o157:h7, whose growth is inhibited in the presence of these acids.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == spread of an ompk36-modified st15 klebsiella pneumoniae variant during an outbreak involving multiple carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae species and clones.
AB  == we aim to characterise multiple ertapenem-resistant (ert-r, n = 15) enterobacteriaceae isolates identified as presumptive carbapenemase producers in  a portuguese hospital in a short period of time (march-july 2010). antibiotic susceptibility patterns, beta-lactamases, genetic relatedness [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus sequence typing (mlst)], plasmid content and  major enterobacterial porins were investigated. ertapenem resistance was associated with deficiencies in major porins and, in some cases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or ampc beta-lactamase production among outbreak and non-outbreak clones. most isolates (n = 8) corresponded to two ert-r klebsiella pneumoniae st15 pfge-types: (i) a sporadic variant (kp-a-ert, n = 1) presenting a premature stop codon in ompk36 and (ii) an epidemic variant (kp-b-ert, n = 7) exhibiting a new ompk36 porin variant, which differed additionally in plasmid and antibiotic susceptibility profiles. st14 (n = 1) and  st45 (n = 1) k. pneumoniae, st131 (n = 1) and st354 (n = 1) escherichia coli, enterobacter asburiae (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1) ert-r clones were also sporadically detected. porin changes in  these isolates included non-sense mutations [ompk35, ompk36, ompf; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 4-32 mg/l], is-mediated porin disruptions (ompk36, ompc; mic = 12->32 mg/l) or alterations in the l3 loop (ompk36; mic = 4-16 mg/l). we describe, for the first time in portugal, the simultaneous emergence of multiple ert-r enterobacteriaceae species and clones in a short period of time. moreover, our results support that a ctx-m-15-producing st15 k. pneumoniae with an ompk36-modified porin might successfully spread in the nosocomial setting.

TI  == genetic engineering of enterobacter asburiae strain jdr-1 for efficient production of ethanol from hemicellulose hydrolysates.
AB  == dilute acid pretreatment is an established method for hydrolyzing the methylglucuronoxylans of hemicellulose to release fermentable xylose. in addition to xylose, this process releases the aldouronate methylglucuronoxylose, which cannot be metabolized by current ethanologenic biocatalysts. enterobacter asburiae jdr-1, isolated from colonized wood, was found to efficiently ferment both methylglucuronoxylose and xylose in acid hydrolysates of sweet gum xylan, producing predominantly ethanol and acetate. transformation of e. asburiae jdr-1  with ploi555 or ploi297, each containing the pet operon containing pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase b (adhb) genes derived from zymomonas mobilis, replaced mixed-acid fermentation with homoethanol fermentation. deletion of the pyruvate formate lyase (pflb) gene further increased the ethanol yield, resulting in a stable e. asburiae e1(ploi555) strain that efficiently utilized both xylose and methylglucuronoxylose in dilute acid hydrolysates of sweet gum xylan. ethanol was produced from xylan hydrolysate by e. asburiae e1(ploi555) with a yield that was 99% of the theoretical maximum yield and at a rate of 0.11 g ethanol/g (dry weight) cells/h, which was 1.57 times the yield and 1.48 times the rate obtained with the ethanologenic strain escherichia coli ko11. this engineered derivative of e. asburiae jdr-1 that is able to ferment the predominant hexoses and pentoses derived from both hemicellulose and cellulose fractions is a promising subject for development as an ethanologenic biocatalyst for production of fuels and chemicals from agricultural residues and energy crops.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic multiresistant plasmid rp4 from escherichia coli to activated sludge bacteria.
AB  == in situ transfer of a self-transmissible, antibiotic-multiresistant plasmid rp4 from a laboratory escherichia coli strain c600 to indigenous activated sludge bacteria was investigated using filter mating. the transfer frequency of rp4 from the donor e. coli to the bacteria that was sampled from two wastewater treatment  plants was 5.1x10(-2) to 7.5x10(-1) and 4.6x10(-3) to 1.3x10(-2)/potential recipient. the isolated transconjugants showed resistance to ap, km, and tc and the presence of a plasmid with a similar size to rp4. the trag gene on rp4 was also detected from all transconjugants. reverse-transfer experiments from the transconjugants to e. coli hb101 indicated that rp4 maintained self-transmissibility in the transconjugants. the transconjugant strains were dominant bacteria in activated sludge including pseudomonas fluorescens, p. putida, and ochrobactrum anthropi and minor populations of enteric bacterial strains including citrobacter freundii, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, e. asburiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae. the transconjugant strains k. pneumoniae ssp. pneumonia, e. cloacae, and e. asburiae had several naturally occurring plasmids. these results suggest that in situ transfer of plasmids and the exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes can occur between released and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge.

TI  == glucose dehydrogenase of a rhizobacterial strain of enterobacter asburiae involved in mineral phosphate solubilization shares properties and sequence homology with other members of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) of gram-negative bacteria is a membrane bound enzyme  catalyzing the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and is involved in the solubilization of insoluble mineral phosphate complexes. a 2.4 kb glucose dehydrogenase gene (gcd) of enterobacter asburiae sharing extensive homology to the gcd of other enterobacteriaceae members was cloned in a pcr-based directional genome walking approach and the expression confirmed in escherichia coli yu423 on both macconkey glucose agar and hydroxyapatite (hap) containing media. mineral phosphate solubilization by the cloned e. asburiae gcd was confirmed by the release of significant amount of phosphate in hap containing liquid medium. gcd was over expressed in e. coli at15 (gcd::cm) and the purified recombinant protein had a high affinity to glucose, and oxidized galactose and maltose with lower affinities.the enzyme was highly sensitive to heat and edta, and belonged to type i, similar to gdh of e. coli.

TI  == escherichia coli o157:h7 survival and growth on lettuce is altered by the presence of epiphytic bacteria.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 can survive in low numbers in soil and on plants. occasionally, conditions may occur in the field that lead to contamination of produce. survival of enteric pathogens in the field is controlled to a certain extent by complex interactions with indigenous soilborne and seedborne epiphytes. identifying these interactions may assist in developing strategies to improve produce safety. two epiphytes were isolated from pathogen-contaminated plants that interact differently with e. coli o157:h7. wausteria paucula enhanced the survival of e. coli o157:h7 six-fold on lettuce foliage grown from coinoculated lettuce seed. in contrast, enterobacter asburiae decreased e. coli o157:h7 survival 20- to 30-fold on foliage. competition also occurred in the rhizosphere  and in plant exudate. this competition may be the result of e. asburiae utilization of several of the carbon and nitrogen substrates typically present in exudate and also used by e. coli o157:h7. hence, competition observed on the plant may involve one or more nutrients provided by the plant. in contrast, a different mechanism may exist between e. coli o157:h7 and w. paucula since commensalism was only observed on foliage, not in the rhizosphere or plant exudate. good agricultural practices that encourage the growth of competing bacteria, like e. asburiae, may reduce the incidence of produce contamination.

TI  == colonization of arabidopsis thaliana with salmonella enterica and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 and competition by enterobacter asburiae.
AB  == enteric pathogens, such as salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7, have been shown to contaminate fresh produce. under appropriate conditions, these bacteria will grow on and invade the plant tissue. we have developed arabidopsis  thaliana (thale cress) as a model system with the intention of studying plant responses to human pathogens. under sterile conditions and at 100% humidity, s. enterica serovar newport and e. coli o157:h7 grew to 10(9) cfu g(-1) on a. thaliana roots and to 2 x 10(7) cfu g(-1) on shoots. furthermore, root inoculation led to contamination of the entire plant, indicating that the pathogens are capable of moving on or within the plant in the absence of competition. inoculation with green fluorescent protein-labeled s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 showed invasion of the roots at lateral root junctions. movement  was eliminated and invasion decreased when nonmotile mutants of s. enterica were  used. survival of s. enterica serovar newport and e. coli o157:h7 on soil-grown plants declined as the plants matured, but both pathogens were detectable for at  least 21 days. survival of the pathogen was reduced in unautoclaved soil and amended soil, suggesting competition from indigenous epiphytes from the soil. enterobacter asburiae was isolated from soil-grown a. thaliana and shown to be effective at suppressing epiphytic growth of both pathogens under gnotobiotic conditions. seed and chaff harvested from contaminated plants were occasionally contaminated. the rate of recovery of s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 from seed varied from undetectable to 19% of the seed pools tested, depending on the method of inoculation. seed contamination by these pathogens was undetectable in the presence of the competitor, enterobacter asburiae. sampling of 74 pools of chaff  indicated a strong correlation between contamination of the chaff and seed (p = 0.025). this suggested that contamination of the seed occurred directly from contaminated chaff or by invasion of the flower or silique. however, contaminated seeds were not sanitized by extensive washing and chlorine treatment, indicating  that some of the bacteria reside in a protected niche on the seed surface or under the seed coat.

TI  == chromosomal ampc genes in enterobacter species other than enterobacter cloacae, and ancestral association of the act-1 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase to enterobacter asburiae.
AB  == the amplification and sequence of ampc genes in enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter cancerogenus, enterobacter dissolvens, enterobacter hormaechei and enterobacter intermedius bring the number of known cephalosporinase sequences from the genus enterobacter to seven. expression in escherichia coli of the ampc  genes from e. asburiae, e. hormaechei and e. intermedius established the functional nature of these genes. ampc from e. asburiae shows 96.5% identity to bla(act-1) encoding a plasmid-borne cephalosporinase previously believed to derive from enterobacter cloacae. the reassignment of act-1 ancestry to e. asburiae is confirmed by the 95.5% identity between ampr upstream of bla(act-1) and ampr from e. asburiae.

TI  == treatment of sanitary-important bacteria by bacteriocin substance v24 in cattle dung water.
AB  == quantification of sanitary-important bacteria (e.g. enterobacteriaceae), as well  as indicators of environmental contamination, was assessed in samples of cattle dung from 25 cattle farms in 15 north-eastern slovakia districts. the inhibitory  effect of crude bacteriocin extract cbe v24 from enterococcus faecalis v24 against listeria monocytogenes ohio and yersinia enterocolitica ye85 was examined in cattle dung water with the aim of finding a new way of eliminating the health  risk of the animal slurry. the following bacterial groups were quantified: salmonella spp., shigella-like spp. , proteus spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., pseudomonas spp. , escherichia coli, listeria spp., staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci (the average count ranged from 102 up to 104 cfu ml-1). antagonistic effect of the crude bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis v24 in the range of 100-600 arbitrary units per ml (au ml-1) was shown against the following bacteria: enterobacter cloacae, ent. asburiae, proteus spp., salmonella spp., acinetobacter lwoffi, l. monocytogenes as well as y. enterocolitica ye85. during tests performed to study the inhibitory effect of the crude bacteriocin cbe v24 (concentration 800, 1600 au ml-1) against l. monocytogenes ohio and y. enterocolitica ye85 in experimentally contaminated cattle dung, a reduction of 2.03 and 1.44 log cfu ml-1, respectively, was already noted after 1 h after crude bacteriocin cbe v24 addition.
