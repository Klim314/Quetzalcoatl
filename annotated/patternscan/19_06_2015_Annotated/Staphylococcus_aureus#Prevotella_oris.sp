TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == slowly growing, ulcerating nodule on the posterior ankle .
AB  == a 34-year-old haitian man presented with a 1-year history of a gradually en- larging, ulcerating nodule on the right posterior ankle that bled after trauma. the patient denied any history of prior trauma at the site of the lesion and foreign travel.there were no hiv risk factors or personal or family history of skin cancer.the patient was otherwise healthy with no additional complaints. physical examination revealed a 1.4 cm firm, hyperpigmented nodule with a yellow  crateriform center on the right posterior ankle (figure 1).a punch biopsy was performed (figures 2, 3). histopathologic examination revealed a superficial and  mid-dermal, multi- nodular proliferation of bland epithelioid cells with occasional foci of ductal differentiation embedded in a fibrotic stroma. focal epidermal connection and mucinous metaplasia were noted. immunohistochemical stains revealed diffuse positive staining of the lesional cells with cytokeratins (high and low) and variable positivity with epithelial membrane antigen (ema), as well as negative s100p. fungal, viral, and mycobacterial tissue cultures were negative and rpr was non-reactive. bacterial tissue culture was positive for prevotella oris and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == microbiological understandings and mysteries of noma (cancrum oris).
AB  == the microbiologic history of noma was reviewed. studies have associated the disease process with large numbers of fusiform bacilli and spirochetal organisms. in order to study the microbiology of the staging and infection periods of noma 62 nigerian children, aged 3-14 years, 22 children had acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (anug) and were also malnourished, 20 exhibited no acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis but were malnourished and 20 were free of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and in good nutritional state) were evaluated for the presence of viruses and oral microorganisms. the anug cases in the malnourished children had a higher incidence of herpesviridae, the main virus being detected was cytomegalovirus. there were more anaerobic microorganisms recovered, with prevotella intermedia as the predominant isolate, in the malnourished children as compared to the healthy children. a study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma lesions was carried out in eight noma patients, 3-15 years of age, in sokoto state, northwestern nigeria. fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from 87.5% of the noma lesions. oral microorganisms isolated included prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0, 50.0 and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. all strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of p. intermedia which showed resistance to penicillin. the pathogenic mechanisms of f. necrophorum as a trigger organism were discussed. the isolation from human noma lesions of f. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic  and animal transmission implications.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == isolation of fusobacterium necrophorum from cancrum oris (noma).
AB  == a study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma (cancrum oris) lesions was carried out in eight noma patients 3-15 years of age in sokoto state  in northwestern nigeria. paper point sampling and conventional anaerobic microbiologic techniques were used. fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from  87.5% of the noma lesions. oral microorganisms included prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0%, 50.0%, and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. the f. necrophorum and p. intermedia isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity to clindamycin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and penicillin using the e-test, and all strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of p. intermedia,  which showed resistance to penicillin. the first reported isolation from human noma lesions of f. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.

TI  == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and  clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of  these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
