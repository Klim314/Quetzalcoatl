TI  == the antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low molar mass chitosans  (lmwc) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (cs) hydrolysates. here, we show the in vitro effect of different cos, lmwc, and  cs on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary cs products by humans. specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium beijerinckii, roseburia intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% cos (2, 3, and 6 kda), 0.025 and  0.05% of lmwc (10 and 16 kda), and 0.025 and 0.1% of cs in vitro. the growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of cos and lmwc in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. a relatively higher resistance to cs hydrolyzates was detected in r. intestinalis and f. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to bacteoides sp. and clostridium sp. the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. the antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (dp). mic ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and dp of cs/lmwc. mbc also decreased with dp. the most effective antimicrobial action was detected in lmwc with 16 kda and cs. weak antimicrobial activity was found in cos with small molecules (2 and 3 kda).

TI  == characterization of the xylan-degrading microbial community from human faeces.
AB  == in humans, plant cell wall polysaccharides represent an important source of dietary fibres that are digested by gut microorganisms. despite the extensive degradation of xylan in the colon, the population structure and the taxonomy of the predominant bacteria involved in degradation of this polysaccharide have not  been extensively explored. the objective of our study was to characterize the xylanolytic microbial community from human faeces, using xylan from different botanic origins. the xylanolytic population was enumerated at high level in all faecal samples studied. the predominant xylanolytic organisms further isolated (20 strains) were assigned to roseburia and bacteroides species. some bacteroides isolates corresponded to the two newly described species bacteroides intestinalis and bacteroides dorei. other isolates were closely related to bacteroides sp. nov., a cellulolytic bacterium recently isolated from human faeces. the remaining bacteroides strains could be considered to belong to a new species of this genus. roseburia isolates could be assigned to the species roseburia intestinalis. the xylanase activity of the bacteroides and roseburia isolates was found to be higher than that of other gut xylanolytic species previously identified. our results provide new insights to the diversity and activity of the human gut xylanolytic community. four new xylan-degrading bacteroides species were identified and the xylanolytic capacity of r. intestinalis was further shown.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
