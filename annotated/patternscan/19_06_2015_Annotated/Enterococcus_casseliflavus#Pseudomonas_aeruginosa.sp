TI  == the soluble alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase from enterococcus casseliflavus. sequence homology with the membrane-associated dehydrogenase and kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzyme.
AB  == the soluble flavoprotein alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase from enterococcus casseliflavus catalyzes the oxidation of a "non-activated" secondary alcohol, in  contrast to the flavin-dependent alpha-hydroxy- and alpha-amino acid oxidases. surprisingly, the alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase sequence is 43% identical to that of the membrane-associated alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase from bacillus subtilis; only low levels of identity (17-22%) result from comparisons with other fad-dependent oxidases. the recombinant alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase is fully active and stabilizes a flavin n(5)-sulfite adduct, but only small amounts of intermediate flavin semiquinone are observed during reductive titrations. direct determination of the redox potential for the fad/fadh2 couple  yields a value of -118 mv; the protein environment raises the flavin potential by 100 mv in order to provide for a productive interaction with the reducing substrate. steady-state kinetic analysis, using the enzyme-monitored turnover method, indicates that a ping-pong mechanism applies and also allows the determination of the corresponding kinetic constants. in addition, stopped-flow studies of the reductive half-reaction provide for the measurement of the dissociation constant for the enzyme. alpha-glycerophosphate complex and the rate constant for reduction of the enzyme flavin. these and other results demonstrate  that this enzyme offers a very promising paradigm for examining the protein determinants for flavin reactivity and mechanism in the energy-yielding metabolism of alpha-glycerophosphate.

TI  == augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == to assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (o-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. for stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and atcc 19433), enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (atcc 25778), and enterococcus gallinarum (atcc 35038) produced extracellular o-2. among 106 strains comprising 13 species  of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular o-2. mean (+/-se) rates of extracellular o-2 production in vitro by e . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of o-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (p=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular o-2 production.
