TI  - Reduction in phytic acid content and enhancement of antioxidant properties of nutricereals by processing for developing a fermented baby food.
AB  - Cereal blends containing pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and oat (Avena sativa) in different ratios were processed (roasted and germinated) and also used as unprocessed flours followed by fermentation with Lactobacillus sp. (Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum). They were screened for total phenolic content (TPC), phytic acid content (PAC) and free radical scavenging activity (FRSA). A formulation with the highest TPC, FRSA and the lowest PAC was selected to optimize a nutricereal based fermented baby food containing selected fermented cereal blends (FCB), rice-corn cooked flour (RCF), whole milk powder (WMP), whey protein concentrate (WPC) and sugar. The optimized baby food formulation contained 37.41 g 100 g(-1) FCB, 9.75 g 100 g(-1) RCF, 27.84 g 100 g(-1) WMP, 5 g 100 g(-1) WPC and 20 g 100 g(-1) sugar. It had high protein, vitamin, minerals, as well as good quantity of carbohydrates and fat, to fulfil the nutritional needs of preschool children of age 1-3 years. The nutricereal based fermented baby food showed high water absorption capacity, dispersibility, wettability and flowability indicating good reconstitution properties.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  - The ability of four Lactobacillus strains - Lactobacillus brevis LBRZ7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), Lactobacillus plantarum LBRZ12 (isolated from fermented cabbage), Lactobacillus fermentum LBRH9 (of human origin) and Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus LBRC11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. Two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread: a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. Wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. The addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and Bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. The inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.
TI  - Characterization, identification and application of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  - There has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. This study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in China. One hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be LAB based on their Gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. These isolates were divided into eight groups (A-H) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. The Group A to H strains were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), L. casei (5.1%), Leuconostoc (Ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), Pediococcus (P.) pentosaceus (24.2%), Enterococcus (E.) mundtii (12.1%), Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae (15.2%), E. faecium (9.1%) and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16S rRNA and recA genes. P. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the LAB population in the paddy rice silage. A selected strain, namely L. casei R 465, was found to be able to grow under low pH conditions and to improve the silage quality with low pH and a relatively high content of lactic acid. This study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant LAB species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with LAB, and that strain R 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities of kombucha.
AB  - Kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and  yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. It is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health benefits. It has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. There are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. In this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented Vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. Glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. Four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778. Our findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha. This study illustrates the potential of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the bioactivities of kombucha.
TI  - Short communication: Single molecule, real-time sequencing technology revealed species- and strain-specific methylation patterns of 2 Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Pacific Biosciences' (Menlo Park, CA) single molecule, real-time sequencing technology was reported to have some advantages in generating finished genomes and characterizing the epigenome of bacteria. In the present study, this technology was used to sequence 2 Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus casei Zhang and Lactobacillus plantarum P-8. Previously, the former bacterium was sequenced by an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA analyzer (Grand Island, NY), whereas the latter one was analyzed with Roche 454 (Indianapolis, IN) and Illumina sequencing technologies (San Diego, CA). The results showed that single molecule, real-time sequencing resulted in high-quality, finished genomes for both strains. Interestingly, epigenome analysis indicates the presence of 1 active N(6)-methyladenine methyltransferase in L. casei Zhang, but none in L. plantarum P-8. Our study revealed for the first time a completely different methylation pattern in 2 Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - [Comparison of expression and antibacterial activities of recombinant porcine lactoferrin expressed in four Lactobacillus species].
AB  - The coding sequence for the mature peptide of porcine lactoferrin (Plf) was synthesized according to the codon usage of lactobacillus, to establish optimized porcine lactoferrin Lactobacillus expression system. The gene was ligated into the Xho I/BamH I site of Lactobacillus expression vector pPG612.1 and the recombinant plasmid pPG612.1-plf was transformed individually into Lactobacillus casei ATCC393, Lactobacillus pentosus KLDS1.0413, Lactobacillus plantarum KLDS1.0344 or Lactobacillus paracasei KLDS1.0652 by electroporation. After induction with xylose, expression of the recombinant proteins was detected by Western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Secretion of recombinant Plf proteins from four recombinant species was determined quantitatively by ELISA. The antibacterial activities of recombinant proteins were measured by agar diffusion method. The result shows that Plf was correctly expressed in four species of recombinant lactobacillus, with molecular weight of about 73 kDa. The expression levels in recombinant Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei were 9.6 mug/mL, 10.8 mug/mL, 12.5 mug/mL and 9.9 mug/mL, respectively. Antimicrobial activity experiment shows that the recombinant proteins were active against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria, Pasteurella. The recombinant Plf expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum showed the best antibacterial activity among all recombinant lactobacillus species. These data represent a basis for the development and application of porcine lactoferrin from recombinant lactobacillus.
TI  - [Biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from Lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  - The biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (RF) from  Luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. The RF showed the protective and reactivating effects on the Bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. Also, it acted as a cryoprotector during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. The RF and the L. casei culture liquid (CL) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. The degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. The maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in Lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of Lactobacillus reuterii. The resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, and L. reuterii correlating with the RF protection degree.
TI  - Fermentation Characteristics and Microbial Diversity of Tropical Grass-legumes Silages.
AB  - Calliandra calothyrsus preserved in silage is an alternative method for improving the crude protein content of feeds for sustainable ruminant production. The aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of silage which contained different levels of C. calothyrsus by examining the fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. Silage was made in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments with three replications i.e.: R0, Pennisetum purpureum 100%; R1, P. purpureum 75%+C. calothyrsus 25%;, R2, P. purpureum 50%+C. calothyrsus 50%; R3, P. purpureum 25%+C. calothyrsus 75%; and R4, C. calothyrsus 100%. All silages were prepared using plastic jar silos (600 g) and incubated at room temperature for 30 days. Silages were analyzed for fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. Increased levels of C. calothyrsus in silage had a significant effect (p<0.01) on the fermentation characteristics. The microbial diversity index decreased and activity was inhibited with increasing levels of C. calothyrsus. The microbial community indicated that there was a population of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Chryseobacterium sp., and uncultured bacteria. The result confirmed that silage with a combination of grass and C. calothyrsus had good fermentation characteristics and microbial communities were dominated by L. plantarum.
TI  - The use of the replication region of plasmid pRS7 from Oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A chimeric plasmid, pRS7Rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of pRS7, a large plasmid from Oenococcus oeni, and pEM64, a plasmid derived from pIJ2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. pRS7Rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in Escherichia coli using its pIJ2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using the replication region of pRS7. High levels of transformants per microg of DNA were obtained by electroporation of pRS7Rep into Pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), Lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), Lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), Leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and Enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). A preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that P. acidilactici and L. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas L. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. pRS7Rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, BamHI, XbaI, SalI, HincII, SphI and PstI, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in L. plantarum, but was less stable in L. casei and P. acidilactici. The ability of pRS7Rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from O. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.
TI  - Microbial communities involved in Kasar cheese ripening.
AB  - The microbiota of non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) and their concomitant  community dynamics during cheese ripening were investigated for traditional Turkish Kasar cheeses made from raw cows' milk. Five batches of 15 Kasar cheeses produced in different dairy plants located in Kars were analysed during their whole ripening phase up to 180 days. Lactobacilli and lactococci were determined as the prevailing microbial groups. The molecular classification and identification of 594 LAB isolates during Kasar cheese ripening were performed through (GTG)5-PCR fingerprinting of their genomic DNA followed by verification of the (GTG)5-PCR clusters obtained after numerical analysis through 16S rRNA gene sequencing of representative isolates. Lactobacillus casei (247 isolates, 41.6%), Lactobacillus plantarum (77 isolates, 13.0%), and Pediococcus acidilactici (58 isolates, 9.8%) were the prevailing NSLAB species in all Kasar cheeses of the different dairy plants investigated throughout cheese ripening. The data of the present study contribute to the inventory of unique cheese varieties to enable the prevention of losses of microbial biodiversity and the selection of starter cultures for controlled cheese manufacturing.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Lactobacillus plantarum DMDL 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  - Nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. Therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. A Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. A number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010. Its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other Lactobacillus strains, including Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, Streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on MRS medium. Compared to these four Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (P<0.001). Based on 16S rDNA sequencing and sequence comparison, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 was identified as either Lactobacillus plantarum or Lactobacillus pentosus. To further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the L-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (L-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. pentosus IG1, respectively, suggesting that Lactobacillu sp. DMDL 9010 is an L. plantarum strain. It was therefore named L. plantarum DMDL 9010. Our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of L. plantarum DMDL 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.
TI  - Novel pyrano and vinylphenol adducts of deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum sourdough.
AB  - This study determined the fate of deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum sourdoughs. Sourdoughs prepared from the red sorghum variety Town were fermented with the caffeic acid-decarboxylating strains Lactobacillus plantarum FUA3171 and the decarboxylase negative L. casei FUA3166. Deoxyanthocyanidins were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Apigeninidin and methoxyapigeninidin were the major deoxyanthocyanidins prior to fermentation. During fermentation, novel deoxyanthocyanidins were formed. Purification by preparative LC, followed by NMR analysis and high-resolution MS identified two of the compounds as 6-deoxyanthocyanidin-vinylphenol and pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin. To identify pathways for their formation, sorghum was fermented with single strains, L. plantarum or L. casei. 6-Deoxyanthocyanidin-vinylphenol and pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin were formed only during fermentation with L. plantarum FUA3171, indicating a role of vinylphenol in their formation. Chemical synthesis confirmed that 6-deoxyanthocyanidin-vinylphenol and pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin are formed from apigeninidin with vinylphenol but not with p-coumaric acid as reactants. In conclusion, the products of microbial decarboxylation of hydroxycinnamic acids convert apigeninidin and methoxyapigeninidin to pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidins and vinylphenol adducts.
TI  - Probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is common in intensive care units (ICUs). Some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of VAP. Several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing VAP in ICUs. We aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of VAP. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing VAP. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1948 to September week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (2010 to September 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding RCTs that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent VAP. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with 1083 participants. All studies compared a form of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Synbiotic 2000FORTE; Ergyphilus; combination Bifidobacterium longum + Lactobacillus bulgaricus + Streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). The analysis of all RCTs showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of VAP (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). However, the aggregated results were uncertain for ICU mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% CI -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -6.15, 95% CI -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). Antibiotics for VAP were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (MD -3.00, 95% CI -6.04 to 0.04). However, the CI of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. There were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.The overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'Risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. The study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.To explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. However, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of VAP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of VAP. However, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of VAP increased the uncertainty in this finding. The available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in ICU or hospital mortality with probiotic use. Three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no clear evidence of a difference. The results of this meta-analysis do not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of VAP in ICU patients.
TI  - Antimutagenic and anticancer effects of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana through Ames test and phylogenetic analysis by 16S rDNA.
AB  - Deaths due to cancer have been increasing in many countries in recent years. One  of the beneficial probiotic properties is potential of antimutagenic and anticancer effects. The aim of this study was to investigate antimutagenic and anticancer effects of 25 strains of lactobacilli spp isolated from Tarhana in vitro conditions and to identify selected strains based on molecular biology. Antimutagenicity and anticarcinogenicity tests were performed based on proposed method of Professor Ames et al. Identification of selected strains was performed based on biochemical and molecular tests. Study of antimutagenic and anticancer effects of 25 different strains led to identification of 4 isolates of Lactobacillus spp. Higher antimutagenic activities against sodium azide were observed in cell suspensions of 4 strains as compared with their supernatants. So the inhibitory percentage of cell suspensions among 4 strains was equal to 60.38% in its highest level. Antimutagenicity of these strains was also increased in the presence of rat S9. Four selected strains were identified based on 16S rDNA sequence. Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus brevis isolated from Tarhana exhibited high antimutagenic and anticancer activity. Of 25 strains of lactobacilli, 4 strains with the highest antimutagenicity effect were chosen as new potential probiotic strains.
TI  - A new risk factor for neonatal vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonisation: bacterial probiotics.
AB  - Abstract Objective: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonisation can be controlled with strict adherence to infection control measures. We describe a VRE outbreak coincident with bacterial probiotic trial. Relationship between probiotic and VRE colonisation, and other possible risk factors were investigated. Methods: Two hundred and ten infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks had been randomised for a trial with probiotic preparation containing Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium lactis, fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, colostrums and lactoferrin (NBL probiotic ATP(R); Nobel, Istanbul, Turkey) between February 2012 and August 2013 when a VRE outbreak also took place. The existence of a relationship between this probiotic preparation and VRE colonisation was investigated. Results: The begining and end of the outbreak were coincident with the beginning and end of the probiotic trial. Demographic and clinical features of neonates did not differ between VRE colonised (n = 94) and non-colonised infants (n = 116) except for vancomycin (p = 0.012) and probiotic (p < 0.001) use. Conclusions: Probiotic and vancomycin exposure were significant risk factors for VRE colonisation. The acquisition and transfer of resistance genes of bacteria may be mediated by probiotics. Therefore, the safety of probiotics is a concern and should be investigated further.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the probiotic and functional potential of Lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented food and human intestine.
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the functional and probiotic characteristics of eight indigenous Lactobacillus strains in vitro. The selected lactobacilli include strains of Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. All strains tolerated both pH 2 for 3 h and 1% bile salt for 24 h. The strains CICC 23174 and CGMCC 1.557 were the most adhesive strains producing the highest quantity of EPS. Although a wide variation in the ability of the eight strains to deplete cholesterol and nitrite, antagonize pathogens, scavenge free radical, and stimulate innate immune response were observed, the strains CICC 23174 and CGMCC 1.557 showed the widest range of these useful traits. Taken together, the strains CICC 23174 and CGMCC 1.557 exhibited the best probiotic properties with the potential for use in the production of probiotic fermented foods.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria in the rumen and feces of dairy cows fed total mixed ration silage to assess the survival of silage bacteria in the gut.
AB  - The survival of silage lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the gut of dairy cows was evaluated by examining the LAB communities of silage and gut contents. Samples were collected at 2 different research institutes (Mie and Okayama) that offered total mixed ration (TMR) silage throughout the year. Silage and feces were sampled in August, October, and November at the Mie institute, whereas silage, rumen fluid, and feces were sampled in June and August at the Okayama institute. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using Lactobacillus-specific primers was performed to detect LAB species in the samples. The selected bands were purified for species identification and the band patterns were used for principal component analysis. Lactic acid was the predominant fermentation product in all the TMR silages analyzed, and the lactic acid level tended to be constant regardless of the sampling time and region. A total of 14 LAB species were detected in the TMR silage samples, of which 5 (Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus pontis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus suebicus, and Lactobacillus plantarum) were detected in the dairy cow feces. Most of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis bands for the feces samples were also detected in the rumen fluid, suggesting that any elimination of silage LAB occurred in the rumen and not in the postruminal gut segments. The principal component analysis indicated that the LAB communities in the silage, rumen fluid, and feces were separately grouped; hence, the survival of silage LAB in the cow rumen and lower gut was deemed difficult. It was concluded that, although the gut LAB community is robust and not easily affected by the silage conditions, several LAB species can inhabit both silage and feces, which suggests the potential of using silage as a vehicle for conveying probiotics.
TI  - Isolating and evaluating lactic acid bacteria strains for effectiveness of Leymus chinensis silage fermentation.
AB  - Five LAB strains were evaluated using the acid production ability test, morphological observation, Gram staining, physiological, biochemical and acid tolerance tests. All five strains (LP1, LP2, LP3, LC1 and LC2) grew at pH 4.0, and LP1 grew at 15 degrees C. Strains LP1, LP2 and LP3 were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, whereas LC1 and LC2 were classified as Lactobacillus casei by sequencing 16S rDNA. The five isolated strains and two commercial inoculants (PS and CL) were added to native grass and Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. for ensiling. All five isolated strains decreased the pH and ammonia nitrogen content, increased the lactic acid content and LP1, LP2 and LP3 increased the acetic content and lactic/acetic acid ratio of L. chinensis silage significantly. The five isolated strains and two commercial inoculants decreased the butyric acid content of the native grass silage. LP2 treatment had lower butyric acid content and ammonia nitrogen content than the other treatments. The five isolated strains improved the quality of L. chinensis silage. The five isolated strains and the two commercial inoculants were not effective in improving the fermentation quality of the native grass silage, but LP2 performed better comparatively. Significance and impact of the study: Leymus chinensis is an important grass in China and Russia, being the primary grass of the short grassland 'steppe' regions of central Asia. However, it has been difficult to make high-quality silage of this species because of low concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC). Isolating and evaluating lactic acid bacteria strains will be helpful for improving the silage quality of this extensively grown species.
TI  - Efficacy of Probiotic Therapy on Atopic Dermatitis in Children: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate a therapeutic efficacy of probiotics mixture (probiotics) in the treatment of children with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial with a washout period of 2 weeks and an intervention period for 6 weeks, conducted from November 2010 to October 2011. One hundred children with mild to moderate AD (2-9 years old) were randomly allocated to the probiotics (Lactobacilluss casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium lactis) or placebo groups. The assessment of efficacy was based on the change in eczema area severity index (EASI), visual analogue scale for pruritus (VASP), fecal cell counts of each strains (log10[cell counts/g stool]), and serum cytokine levels (Interleukin-4 [IL-4]; IL-10; Tumor necrosis factor alpha, [TNF-alpha]) in weeks 0 and 6. RESULTS: Demographics and baseline characteristics at the week 0 were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The significant increments in fecal-cell counts were observed in the probiotcs group at week 6 (P=0.00), while the cytokine levels between the 2 groups were not significantly different in week 6 (IL-4, P=0.50; IL-10, P=0.58; TNF-alpha, P=0.82). The probiotics significantly improved clinical severity after 6 weeks' intervention of probiotics; however, the placebo group also showed significant improvement (EASI; P=0.00, VASP; P=0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that probiotics successfully colonized in the intestine after 6 weeks' intervention; nevertheless, we could not find an additional therapeutic or immunomodulatory effects on the treatment of AD. Further long-term studies will be necessary to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of probiotics.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - The effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans (MS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (LB), Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Lactobacillus casei LC01, Lactobacillus plantarum ST-III, Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, were used as test strains effecting on the Streptococci strain S. mutans UA159 in this study. The effect of LB strains and their supernatants on the viability of the MS was evaluated. Then, the effect of LB strains on the growth of MS biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence microscope. RESULTS: All of the LB strains inhibited the growth of MS at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) (P < 0.05). Untreated (without pH adjustment and ultrafiltration) LB supernatants from all of the LB strains inhibited the growth of MS (P < 0.05) as well. After pH adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from L. casei Shirota and L. rhamnosus HN001 inhibited the growth of MS (P < 0.05). MS biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of L. casei Shirota and L. rhamnosus HN001 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of MS, likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on MS were dependent on the LB strains used.
TI  - Behaviour of lactic acid bacteria populations in Pecorino di Carmasciano cheese samples submitted to environmental conditions prevailing in the gastrointestinal tract: evaluation by means of a polyphasic approach.
AB  - The survival of the autochthonous microflora, of samples collected during Pecorino di Carmasciano cheese manufacturing, was evaluated along the passage through a model mimicking the gastro-intestinal tract. The aim was the selection of lactic acid bacteria potentially able to arrive alive and metabolically active to the colon. The dynamics of lactic microbiota, throughout simulated digestion of cheese samples, were evaluated by means of an approach PCR-DGGE-based. Dominant species after cheese digestion could be related to the Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei groups. Sixty-three strains, which survived to simulated gastro-intestinal transit, were further evaluated for technological features and tolerance to human digestion in several experimental conditions, according to routinely used protocols. Bacterial survival appeared to be, more than strain-specific, strongly affected by experimental conditions, i.e. some strains showed an acceptable survival when resuspended in skim milk but not in ewe milk and vice versa. Nevertheless according to data, one gram of fresh Pecorino di Carmasciano cheese may convey to human colon about the same amount of viable LAB of a probiotic drink. Although it cannot be assumed that lactobacilli introduced with Pecorino have beneficial effects on the host, the healthy impact of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria of naturally fermented food has a broad consensus in the current literature.
TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  - PURPOSE: Inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bacteria such as Actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. It is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. Hence, the study was undertaken to screen LABs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. METHODS: This study isolated, screened, identified and extracted Lactobacillus strains (Lb1-15) from human infant faecal samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. Lactobacillus reference strains (Ref1-7), a Gram positive control (Ctrl1) and two Gram negative controls (Ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. RESULTS: Faecal isolates were identified by DNA sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Some strains (L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. casei and L. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). Inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium). Interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (L. plantarum) differed substantially. Some Lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and amylase). Anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a L. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (Area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). CONCLUSION: These results definitively demonstrate that Lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. Although the potential use of LAB such as Lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. Further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.
TI  - Antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  - In this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (including 5 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 Lactobacillus fermentum, 1 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 Lactobacillus plantarum, 1 Lactobacillus sakei, and 1 Lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum, and Aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (PLA). Results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (CFS) from LAB fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. The inhibition ability of CFS was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees C, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the pH of CFS was adjusted to 6.5. With the exception of L. plantarum NRRL B-4496 and L. acidophilus ATCC-4495, all other LAB strains produced PLA ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mM. The high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial PLA (3.01-36.10mM) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied LAB and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare MALDI-TOF results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific PCR. METHODS: The 87 isolates were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Microflex LT, MALDI Biotyper 3.0, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. For the identification with species-specific PCR, oligonucleotide primers (16S rRNA) specific for L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. The PCR-products were separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. RESULTS: For 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as L. rhamnosus, 16 as L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as L. paracasei, 3 as L. gasseri, 2 as L. plantarum, and 1 as L. casei. In 4.5% of the cases the results were discordant. Of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific PCR, 1 strain was identified by MALDI-TOF MS as L. spec. and 1 as L. parabuchneri. One strain could not be identified by either method. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods are highly sensitive. Limitations can be the precision of the primers (PCR) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. Additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.
TI  - Enrichment of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in hen eggs and broiler chickens meat by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - 1. The aim of this work was to compare conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentrations in chickens supplemented with 4 American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum, and 4 isolates of Lactobacillus reuteri from camel, cattle, sheep and goat rumen extracts. 2. Micro-organisms were grown anaerobically in MRS broth, and 10(6) CFU/ml of bacteria were administered orally to mixed-sex, 1-d-old broiler chickens weekly for 4 weeks and to 23-week-old layer hens weekly for 6 weeks. 3. The 4 strains were evaluated for their effects on synthesis of CLA in hen eggs and broiler meat cuts. 4. Administration of pure Lactobacillus and isolated L. reuteri strains from camel, cattle, goat and sheep led to significantly increased CLA concentrations of 0.2-1.2 mg/g of fat in eggs and 0.3-1.88 mg/g of fat in broiler chicken flesh homogenates of leg, thigh and breast. 5. These data demonstrate that lactic acid bacteria of animal origin (L. reuteri) significantly enhanced CLA synthesis in both eggs and broiler meat cuts.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [Identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: LABs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16S rRNA sequence. Genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). The sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all LAB isolates by Kirby-Bauer paper diffusion (K-B method). Meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including erythromycin resistance genes (ermA and ermB) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetM, tetK, tetS, tetQ, tetO, tetL and tetW), were detected by PCR amplification in the identified LAB isolates. The PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Total 100 LABs were isolated, including 23 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 Lactobacillus casei, 30 Streptococcus thermophilus, 5 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 Lactobacillus paracasei. The drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. Moreover, 5 ARGs were found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermB gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet K in 4 isolates, tetL in 2 isolates, tetM in 4 isolates, tetO in 2 isolates. erm A, tet S, tet Q and tet W genes were not detected in the isolates. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSIONS: Some LABs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. Antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. All the LAB isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. We proved again that LAB could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - Immunostimulatory CpG motifs in the genomes of gut bacteria and their role in human health and disease.
AB  - Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling plays an important role in epithelial and immune cells of the intestine. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA, and TLR9 signalling maintains the gut epithelial homeostasis. Here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the frequency of CpG motifs in the genomes of gut commensal bacteria across major bacterial phyla. The frequency of potentially immunostimulatory CpG motifs (all CpG hexamers) or purine-purine-CG-pyrimidine-pyrimidine hexamers was linearly dependent on the genomic G+C content. We found that species belonging to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria (including bifidobacteria) carried high counts of GTCGTT, the optimal motif stimulating human TLR9. We also found that Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, whose strains have been marketed as probiotics, had high counts of GTCGTT motifs. As gut bacterial species differ significantly in their genomic content of CpG motifs, the overall load of CpG motifs in the intestine depends on the species assembly of microbiota and their cell numbers. The optimal CpG motif content of microbiota may depend on the host's physiological status and, consequently, on an adequate level of TLR9 signalling. We speculate that microbiota with increased numbers of microbes with CpG motif-rich DNA could better support mucosal functions in healthy individuals and improve the T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 imbalance in allergic diseases. In autoimmune disorders, CpG motif-rich DNA could, however, further increase the Th1-type immune responsiveness. Estimation of the load of microbe-associated molecular patterns, including CpG motifs, in gut microbiota could shed new light on host-microbe interactions across a range of diseases.
TI  - Role of Lactobacillus in the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to Lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus in the prevention of CDAD. METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, National Institutes of Health, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (RCT) from 1990 to December 2012. Only RCT in English and Chinese using Lactobacillus for the prevention of documented CDAD were considered for study inclusion. The data was analyzed by Review Manager and SPSS software. RESULTS: Seven placebo-controlled RCTs that evaluated the prevention of CDAD, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. The total daily dose of Lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (CFU). A low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. The combined risk ratio (RR) of developing CDAD was significantly lower in subjects who received Lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (RR 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.67). A combination regimen of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) and Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of CDAD, while single regimens of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) did not. Across all trials, positive significant effects of Lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.36). Whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) CFU/d Lactobacillus could prevent CDAD significantly or not was unclear. CONCLUSION: There is a sufficient evidence to recommend Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus and L. casei) as a prevention therapy for CDAD.
TI  - Nutritionally enhanced fermented sausages as a vehicle for potential probiotic lactobacilli delivery.
AB  - The suitability of three potential probiotic lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus  casei CTC1677, L. casei CTC1678 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CTC1679), previously isolated from infants' faeces and characterized, and three commercial probiotic strains (Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, L. rhamnosus GG and L. casei Shirota) was assessed during the manufacture of low-acid fermented sausages (fuets) with reduced Na(+) and fat content. The inoculated strains were successfully monitored by RAPD-PCR during the process. L. rhamnosus CTC1679 was the only strain able to grow and dominate (levels ca. 10(8)CFU/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria population in two independent trials, throughout the ripening process. Thus, fuet containing L. rhamnosus CTC1679 as a starter culture could be a suitable vehicle for putative probiotic bacteria delivery. All the final products recorded a satisfactory overall sensory quality without any noticeable off-flavour, and with the characteristic sensory properties of low-acid fermented sausages.
TI  - Molecular identification of Lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a Brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  - Puba or carima is a Brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. A total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar (MRS); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. In all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 CFU/g). 16S-23S rRNA ARDRA pattern assigned 116 isolates to the Lactobacillus genus, represented by the species Lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), Lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), Lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), Lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), Lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), Lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), Lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and Lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). recA gene-multiplex PCR analysis revealed that L. plantarum group isolates belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). Genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based PCR using the primer ERIC2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). The Lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. All the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. This antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. This study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of Lactobacillus spp. of puba.
TI  - Lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. This effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. The agar spot test was used to show that twenty Lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica. This inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in pH resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. The inhibition of Y. enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus casei C1 and Lactobacillus plantarum C4, was also associated with the pH decrease. However, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with L. plantarum C4, which exerted a partial protective effect against S. Typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. Our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Removal of 3-methylindole by lactic acid bacteria
AB  - 3-Methylindole (3MI) is a substance with an unpleasant odor that is found in intact male pigs and is known to negatively affect consumers of pork. The growth of four strains of lactic acid bacteria [Lactobacillus brevis 1.12 (L. brevis 1.12), L. plantarum 102, L. casei 6103 and L. plantarum ATCC8014] in incubation medium with 3MI was studied. The four strains were tested for their ability to remove 3MI from the medium. The growth of L. brevis 1.12 remained steady as the levels of 3MI increased 3MI from 0.2 to 1.0 mug/ml. The 3MI removal ability of L. brevis 1.12 was the strongest among the four strains, and the highest removal rate was 65.35+/-0.3% in 1 ml incubation medium containing 1.0 mug/ml 3MI for 120 h. Furthermore, the supernatant fluid of the fermentation broth of L. brevis 1.12 had a stronger ability to remove 3MI than cell pellets and cell extracts and the removal rate was 14.4+/-0.3% in 24 h. Further results indicate that the mode of removal of 3MI was not through the physical binding of cells by L. brevis 1.12.
TI  - Identification of thermo tolerant lactic acid bacteria isolated from silage prepared in the hot and humid climate of Southwestern Japan.
AB  - To develop high-quality silage starters adapted to hot and humid weather, 12 LAB  isolates from silage produced in Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan were characterized based on their morphological features, growth curves and sugar utilization. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of the V2-V3 region of their 16S rRNA genes and the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ITS) regions were determined. The isolates were also subjected to RAPD-PCR analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, G+C content analysis and immuno-identification using species-specific monoclonal antibodies and SDS-PAGE profiling. Nearly all of the isolates exhibited high thermotolerance and rapid growth. Combining ITS sequence analysis, RAPD-PCR and immuno-identification enabled rapid and accurate identification of closely related LAB strains that other methods failed to appropriately differentiate; for example, L. plantarum was distinguished from L. pentosus, and L. casei was distinguished from L. rhamonsus. Using the aforementioned techniques, the isolated strains were identified as L. plantarum, L. rhamonsus, L. rapi, Pediococcus pentosaceus and P. lolii. Our findings also showed that there is greater diversity among thermophilic LABs in silage prepared in a hot and humid environment.
TI  - Genetic engineering techniques for lactic acid bacteria: construction of a stable shuttle vector and expression vector for beta-glucuronidase.
AB  - The shuttle vector, pUL6erm, was constructed by using a replicon from pL2, a multiple cloning site, colE1 ori, the ori of Gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the erythromycin resistance gene from pVA838 as a selection marker. pUL6erm could be transformed easily and maintained stably in Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei. Transformation assays of pUL6erm indicated that it had a narrow host range. beta-Glucuronidase was induced in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl and 50 mM glutamate and expressed at 2.4 U mg(-1) with the expression vector (pUL6erm-gadR-GUS) constructed based on pUL6erm carrying beta-glucuronidase gene wuth a chloride-inducible (gadR) expression cassette using Pgad as promoter. Therefore, pUL6erm and pUL6erm-gadR-GUS might be a safe and useful genetic tool for the improvement of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Anti-HIV-1 activity, protease inhibition and safety profile of extracts prepared  from Rhus parviflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present study, extracts prepared from the leaves of Rhus parviflora Roxb. (Anacardiaceae) were evaluated for their anti-HIV activity, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. METHODS: Aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts prepared from leaves of the plant were tested for their cytotoxicity and anti-HIV property using reporter gene based assays as well as human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Further these extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease activity. Safety profile of the extracts was determined on viability of Lactobacillus sp., secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by vaginal keratinocytes and transepithelial resistance. RESULTS: Both aqueous (IC50 = 15 mug/ml) and 50% ethanolic (IC50 = 26 mug/ml) extracts prepared from leaves of R. parviflora showed anti-HIV activity in TZM-bl cells wherein the virus was treated with the extracts prior to infection. Further, both the extracts also inhibited virus load in HIV infected CEM-GFP cells and human PBLs. The anti-HIV activity is mediated through inhibition of HIV-1 protease activity. Both the extracts did not disturb the integrity of monolayer formed by intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. The extracts when tested up to 100 mug/ml did not significantly reduce the viability of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. The extracts (100 mug/ml) did not reveal any cytotoxic effect on vaginal keratinocytes (Vk2/E6E7). Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by Vk2/E6E7 cells treated with both the plant extracts were within the non-inflammatory range. CONCLUSIONS: The studies reported herein showed in vitro anti-HIV activity and preliminary safety profile of the extracts prepared from the leaves of R. parviflora.
TI  - [Microorganisms effect with probiotic potential in water quality and growth of the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Decapoda: Penaeidae) in intensive culture].
AB  - The use of probiotics has gained acceptance in aquaculture, particularly in maintaining water quality and enhancing growth in organisms. This study analyzed the effect of the commercial (EM, Japan) natural product composed by (Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) added to the water, in order to determine its effect in water quality, sediment and growth of L. vannamei under intensive culture. The evaluation included three treatments with a weekly addition of EM: i) tanks without probiotics (C), ii) tanks with a dose of 4 L/ha (EM1) and iii) tanks with a dose of 10 L/ha (EM2). The treatment C was carried out three times, while treatments EM1 and EM2 were carried out four times. A total of 4 350 shrimps were measured for total length and weight, to calculate total and porcentual weight gain, daily weight gain, specific growth rate (TCE), and food conversion factor (FCA); besides, the survival rate was estimated. The use of probiotics allowed a shorter harvest time in treatments EM1 (90 d) and EM2 (105 d) with relation to the treatment C (120d). Treatments EM1 and EM2 were within the recommended intervals for culture, with respect to treatment C. The use of probiotic bacteria significantly regulated pH (EM1, 8.03 +/- 0.33; EM2, 7.77 +/- 0.22; C, 9.08 +/- 0.35) and reduced nitrate concentration (EM1, 0.64 +/- 0.25 mg/L; EM2, 0.39 +/- 0.26 mg/L; C, 0.71 mg/L). Water pH mostly explained the variance with respect to the treatments. Treatment EM2 presented the greatest removal of organic matter (1.77 +/- 0.45%), whereas the contents of extractable phosphorus increased significantly in treatment EM1 with 21.6 +/- 7.99 mg/kg and in treatment EM2 with 21.6 +/- 8.45 mg/kg with control relation (14.3 +/- 5.47). The shrimp growth was influenced by dissolved oxygen, salinity and pH in the sediment, establishing that salinity was the most important variable in the weight with a negative association. Treatment EM1 recorded an improved TCE (2.69 +/- 0.35%/d) and FCA (1.46 +/- 0.20) with relation to the control treatment (TCE, 1.88 +/- 0.25%/d; FCA, 2.13 +/- 0.48). Survival was significantly greater in treatments containing probiotics with 61 +/- 8.76% and 60 +/- 10.5% for EM1 and EM2, respectively. This study indicated the positive effect obtained with the use of this commercial probiotic, to improve culture conditions and growth parameters in an intensive culture of L. vannamei.
TI  - A review on traditional Turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages: microbiota, fermentation process and quality characteristics.
AB  - Shalgam juice, hardaliye, boza, ayran (yoghurt drink) and kefir are the most known traditional Turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages. The first three are obtained from vegetables, fruits and cereals, and the last two ones are made of milk. Shalgam juice, hardaliye and ayran are produced by lactic acid fermentation. Their microbiota is mainly composed of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei in shalgam fermentation and L. paracasei subsp. paracasei and Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum in hardaliye fermentation are predominant. Ayran is traditionally prepared by mixing yoghurt with water and salt. Yoghurt starter cultures are used in industrial ayran production. On the other hand, both alcohol and lactic acid fermentation occur in boza and kefir. Boza is prepared by using a mixture of maize, wheat and rice or their flours and water. Generally previously produced boza or sourdough/yoghurt are used as starter culture which is rich in Lactobacillus spp. and yeasts. Kefir is prepared by inoculation of raw milk with kefir grains which consists of different species of yeasts, LAB, acetic acid bacteria in a protein and polysaccharide matrix. The microbiota of boza and kefir is affected from raw materials, the origin and the production methods. In this review, physicochemical properties, manufacturing technologies, microbiota and shelf life and spoilage of traditional fermented beverages were summarized along with how fermentation conditions could affect rheological properties of end product which are important during processing and storage.
TI  - Effect of Aloe vera juice on growth and activities of Lactobacilli in-vitro.
AB  - In present investigation, different concentrations of Aloe vera juice incorporated into the growth media of Lactobacilli were tested to observe the effect on growth and activities of these bacteria. From the results obtained, it was observed that aloe vera juice at a concentration of 5% v/v was effective in promoting the growth of L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. casei, as evident from the fall in pH and increased acidity, as well as from the improved generation time. At 15 to 25% concentration, growth was unaffected as compared to the controls; however, concentration higher than 25%v/v discouraged the growth. Overall, it was concluded that Aloe vera juice or gel at a particular concentration could possibly be used in combination with probiotic Lactobacillus strain(s) as a combinational therapy for gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular diseases.
TI  - Immunomodulatory and anti-allergic effects of orally administered Lactobacillus species in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.
AB  - We investigated the effects of orally administered probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus species) as allergic immune modulators in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with OVA twice at a 2-week interval for allergy sensitization. The mice were then orally administered Lactobacillus casei YIT9029 (L1), L. casei HY7201 (L2), L. brevis HY7401 (L3), or L. plantarum HY20301 (L4) every 2 days for 3 weeks. Total IgE levels significantly decreased in sera of L3-administered mice but increased in the other groups. OVA-specific IgE levels decreased slightly in sera of mice administered L1, L3, and L4 but increased significantly in L2-administered mice. In passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) using sera from administered mice, only the L3-administered group showed reaction inhibition. High expression of TLR-2 with interferon (IFN)-gamma stimulation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurred in L3- or L4-administered mice. Th1 cytokines, including IFN-gamma and interleukin (IL)- 12, increased in splenocytes of L3-administered mice; however, IL-4 decreased in L1- and L4-administered groups; IL-5 decreased in all experimental groups. IL-6 decreased in the L3-administered group; and IL-10 decreased in L1-, L2-, and L3-administered groups. L3 induced antiallergic effects by increasing Th1 cytokines, decreasing Th2 cytokines, and inhibiting the PCA reaction, whereas L2 administration increased allergic effects.
TI  - Significant effect of Ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. Reconstituted skim milk (RSM) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. In addition to proteins and carbohydrate, RSM is rich in calcium. It is not clear which component is critical in the RSM protection mechanism. This study investigated the independent effect of calcium. Ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ZY, Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum P8 and Streptococcus thermophilus ND03. The results showed that certain Ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the LAB strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. In some cases, the improvements were dramatic. More scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the Ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. In the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with Ca(2+) added as a prime factor.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses DMH-induced procarcinogenic fecal enzymes and preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci in early colon carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats.
AB  - Diet makes an important contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk implying risks for CRC are potentially reducible. Therefore, the probiotics have been suggested as the prophylactic measure in colon cancer. In this study, different probiotics were used to compare their protective potential against 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH)-induced chemical colon carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats. Animals belonging to different probiotic groups were fed orally with 1 x 10(9) lactobacilli daily for 1 week, and then a weekly injection of DMH was given intraperitoneally for 6 wks with daily administration of probiotic. Lactobacillus GG and L.acidophilus + DMH-treated animals had maximum percent reduction in ACF counts. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in fecal nitroreductase activity was observed in L.casei + DMH and L.plantarum + DMH-treated rats whereas beta-glucuronidase activity decreased in L.GG + DMH and L.acidophilus + DMH-treated rats. Animals treated with Bifidobacterium bifidum + DMH had significant decreased beta-glucosidase activity. However, not much difference was observed in the colon morphology of animals belonging to various probiotic + DMH-treated rats compared with DMH-treated alone. The results indicated that probiotics, L.GG, and L.acidophilus can be used as the better prophylactic agents for experimental colon carcinogenesis.
TI  - [Analysis of microbial community structure in lactic acid fermentation from kitchen waste].
AB  - In this study, PCR-DGGE was used to analyze the microbial community structure in  lactic acid fermentation from kitchen waste. The results showed that with Lactobacillus amylophilus inoculation, both the microbial diversity and lactic acid production in the open fermentation system were higher than those in the sterilized fermentation system. These results indicated that the microbial diversity and the lactic acid production have great correlation in the kitchen waste fermentation system. Through analyzing the sequence of some DNA bands excised from the DGGE gel, it showed that in addition to the inoculation of Lactobacillus amylophilus there were some indigenous lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus sp., Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and indigenous hydrolytic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas sp.. These indigenous bacteria can help to promote lactic acid production. PCR-DGGE is feasible for analyzing the dynamic changes of microbial community structure in kitchen waste with complicated composition.
TI  - Selection of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from fermented olives by in vitro tests.
AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. Seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 Ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 Lactobacillus plantarum, 37 Lb. pentosus, 1 Lb. paraplantarum, and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. Lb. rhamnosus GG and Lb. casei Shirota were used as reference strains. The in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157:H7), Caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. Three (3) Lb. pentosus, 4 Lb. plantarum and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low pH. The majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 Lb. plantarum and 7 Lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. None of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. Variable efficiency to adhere to Caco-2 cells was observed. This was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. None of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. As a whole, 4 strains of Lb. pentosus, 3 strains of Lb. plantarum and 2 strains of Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains Lb. casei Shirota and Lb. rhamnosus GG. These strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.
TI  - Differences in TLR9-dependent inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and NF-kappa B/I kappa B-alpha system activation by genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic DNA  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. Despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live LAB dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic DNA level. We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species-Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri-using Caco-2 cells. To evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation were examined. All LAB genomic DNAs dose-dependently decreased H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation. Comparison of these effects between Lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of L. acidophilus genomic DNA are lower than those of the other species. Furthermore, suppression of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a specific receptor of bacterial DNA, expression by RNAi abolished the decrease of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation by LAB genomic DNA. Our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic DNA differ between Lactobacillus species and TLR9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of LAB genomic DNA.
TI  - Probiotic potential of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  - Twelve Lactobacillus isolates from Brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. The strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (7), Lb. brevis (2), Lb. casei (2) and Lb. parabuchneri (1). All strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. Only five strains of Lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. Autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. All lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except Lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge DPPH radical. beta-Galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 Miller units. Inhibition of food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. The Lactobacillus strains from Brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains Lb. brevis SM-B and Lb. plantarum SM-I. Both presented high acid tolerance. In addition, Lb. brevis SM-B also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and Lb. plantarum SM-I was the highest beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.
TI  - Bugs that debugs: Probiotics.
AB  - The oral cavity harbors a diverse array of bacterial species. There are more than 600 species that colonize in the oral cavity. These include a lot of organisms that are not commonly known to reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and also are more familiar: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The balance of all these microorganisms can easily be disturbed and a prevalence of pathogenic organisms can lead to various oral health problems including dental caries, periodontitis, and halitosis.
TI  - Is a multispecies probiotic mixture effective in constipation during pregnancy? 'A pilot study'.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Constipation during pregnancy is a common problem. Nowadays only few  effective interventions are published preventing or treating constipation during pregnancy. However, their use is limited due to side-effects. This uncontrolled intervention study was performed to determine if a mixture of probiotics in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy is effective. METHODS: Women aged >/= 18 years with functional constipation were included at the Obstetrical outpatient clinic and midwife practices. Patients received during four weeks a daily dose of Ecologic(R)Relief (Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Bifidobacterium longum W108, Lactobacillus casei W79, Lactobacillus plantarum W62 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus W71 (total 4*10(9) CFU)). For all analyses, the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test was used. Primary outcome measure was change in defecation frequency. Secondary outcome measures were stool consistency, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, manual manoeuvres to facilitate defecation, abdominal pain, adverse effects, presence of reflux episodes and intake of Bisacodyl. RESULTS: 20 women were included. Defecation frequency significantly increased from 3.1 at baseline to 6.7 in week four (p < 0.01). Compared to baseline, a significant decrease in 1) sensation of anorectal obstruction from 90.0% to 45.0% (p < 0.01), 2) sensation of incomplete evacuation from 90.0% to 40.0% (p < 0.01), 3) straining during defecation from 100% to 65% (p = 0.01), 4) episodes of abdominal pain from 60% to 20% (p = 0.01) and 5) the presence of reflux episodes from 60% to 20% in week four (p = 0.01) was found. Other secondary outcomes did not decrease significantly. No side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Ecologic(R)Relief is effective in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy. A randomised placebo controlled trial is required to confirm these data.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Strain-level characterization of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in Norvegia cheese by high-resolution melt analysis.
AB  - The nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) constitute an important microbial group found during cheese ripening and they are thought to be fundamental to the quality of cheese. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for NSLAB are important for cheese quality control and in understanding the cheese ripening process. Here, we present a novel rapid approach for strain-level characterization through combined 16S rRNA gene and repetitive sequence-based high-resolution melt analysis (HRM). The approach was demonstrated through the characterization of 94 isolates from Norvegia, a Gouda-type cheese. The HRM profiles of the V1 and V3 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolates were compared with the HRM profiles of 13 reference strains. The HRM profile comparison of the V1 and V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene allowed discrimination of isolates and reference strains. Among the cheese isolates, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (62 isolates) and Lactobacillus plantarum/Lactobacillus pentosus (27 isolates) were the dominant species, whereas Lactobacillus curvatus/Lactobacillus sakei were found occasionally (5 isolates). The HRM profiling of repetitive sequence-based PCR using the (GTG)(5) primer was developed for strain-level characterization. The clustering analysis of the HRM profiles showed high discriminatory power, similar to that of cluster analysis based on the gel method. In conclusion, the HRM approach in this study may be applied as a fast, accurate, and reproducible method for characterization of the NSLAB microflora in cheese and may be applicable to other microbial environments following selective plate culturing.
TI  - Accelerated ripening of Caciocavallo Pugliese cheese with attenuated adjuncts of  selected nonstarter lactobacilli.
AB  - The nonstarter lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum CC3M8, Lactobacillus  paracasei CC3M35, and Lactobacillus casei LC01, previously isolated from aged Caciocavallo Pugliese cheese or used in cheesemaking, were used as adjunct cultures (AC) or attenuated (by sonication treatment) adjunct cultures (AAC) for the manufacture of Caciocavallo Pugliese cheese on an industrial scale. Preliminary studies on the kinetics of growth and acidification and activities of several enzymes of AAC were characterized in vitro. As shown by the fluorescence determination of live versus dead or damaged cells and other phenotype features, attenuation resulted in a portion of the cells being damaged and a portion of the cells being capable of growing with time. Compared with the control cheese (without adjunct cultures) and the cheese with AAC, the addition of AC resulted in a lower pH after manufacture, which altered the gross composition of the cheese. As shown by plate count and confirmed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR, the 3 species of nonstarter lactobacilli persisted during ripening but the number of cultivable cells varied between AC and AAC. Slight differences were found between cheeses regarding primary proteolysis. The major differences between cheeses were the accumulation of free amino acids and the activity levels of several enzymes, which were highest in the Caciocavallo Pugliese cheeses made with the addition of AAC. As shown by triangle test, the sensory properties of the cheese made with AAC at 45 d did not differ from those of the control Caciocavallo Pugliese cheese at 60 d of ripening. In contrast, the cheese made with AC at 45 d differed from both the Caciocavallo Pugliese cheese without adjuncts and the cheese made with AAC. Attenuated adjunct cultures are suitable for accelerating the ripening of Caciocavallo Pugliese cheese without modifying the main features of the traditional cheese.
TI  - Effect of flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli to intestinal cells.
AB  - The effect of dietary flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells was unraveled. The inhibitory activity of these compounds on intestinal cells was highlighted. The cytotoxic effect was shown to depend on both the compound's chemical structure (galloylation and polymerization) and degree of differentiation of intestinal cells. The effect of flavan-3-ols on bacteria adhesion differed greatly between compounds, strains, and intestinal cells. All flavan-3-ols inhibited significantly Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL379 adhesion except epigallocatechin gallate, which enhanced L. acidophilus LA-5 adhesion to Caco-2. Procyanidins B1 and B2 increased remarkably the adhesion of Lactobacillus casei LC115 to HT-29 cells, whereas epigallocatechin increased L. casei LC115 adhesion to Caco-2. These data showed the potential of flavan-3-ols to alter gut microecology by modifying adhesion of lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells.
TI  - Bioconversion of oleuropein to hydroxytyrosol by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this work is to study the conversion of oleuropein-a polyphenol present in olives and olive oil by-products-into hydroxytyrosol, a polyphenol with antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The hydrolysis reaction is performed by lactic acid bacteria. Six bacterial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum 6907, Lactobacillus paracasei 9192, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium lactis BO, Enterococcus faecium 32, Lactobacillus LAFTI 10) were tested under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The oleuropein degradation and hydroxytyrosol formation were monitored by HPLC. Results showed that oleuropein could be successfully converted into hydroxytyrosol. The most effective strain was Lactobacillus plantarum 6907, with a reaction yield of hydroxytyrosol of about 30 %. Different reaction mechanisms were observed for different microorganisms; a different yield was observed for Lactobacillus paracasei 9192 under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and an intermediate metabolite (oleuropein aglycone) was detected for Lactobacillus paracasei 9192 and Lactobacillus plantarum 6907 only. This study could have significant applications, as this reaction can be used to increase the value of olive oil by-products and/or to improve the taste of unripe olives.
TI  - Investigation of antibacterial, acid and bile tolerance properties of lactobacilli isolated from Koozeh cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus strains are a major part of the probiotics, microflora of the intestine and of fermented dairy products, and are found in a variety of environments. The aim of this study was to find out the ability of bile and acid tolerance and antibacterial properties of the twenty eight isolates of three group lactobacilli namely Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus delbruki. For this purpose Twenty eight different Lactobacillus strains that isolated from Koozeh cheese as a traditional cheese were screened. The acid tolerance test was studied under pH 2.0 and 3.0 with 7.5 as control. The cell count for the acid tolerance test was obtained at an interval of 0, 1, 2 and 3 hours respectively and was pour plated on Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar to be incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. All cells were selected for bile tolerance test in MRS broth containing bile concentrations of 0% as control and 0.3% as test. Then cell counts were enumerated after 24 hours of incubation on MRS agar. Results showed twenty seven isolates did not have ability to tolerate acid and bile salts and antimicrobial activity against four indicator bacteria included Eshirichia coli, Listeria monocytogenesis, bacillus cereus, Salmonella entritidis. Only one Isolate namely Lactobacillus casei could tolerate acid and bile salt and had antibacterial activity against of L. monocytogenesis. Therefore we can consider this strain as a native probiotic but extra examinations was required.
TI  - Recombinant production of hyperthermostable CelB from Pyrococcus furiosus in Lactobacillus sp.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used widespread in the food industry as traditional starters for various fermented foods. For recombinant protein production, LAB would be superior with view from the food safety demands since most of them are Generally Recognized As Safe organisms. We investigated the two pSIP expression systems, pSIP403 and pSIP409 (Sorvig et al. 2005), to produce a hyper-thermophilic beta-glycosidase (CelB) from Pyrococcus furiosus in Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 and Lactobacillus casei as hosts, respectively. Both lactobacilli harboring the pSIP409-celB vector produced active CelB in batch bioreactor cultivations (MRS medium) while the specific CelB activity of the cell free extract was about 44 % higher with L. plantarum (1,590 +/- 90 nkat/mg(protein)) than with L. casei (1,070 +/- 66 nkat/mg(protein)) using p-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (pNPGal) as the substrate. A fed-batch bioreactor cultivation of L. plantarum NC8 pSIP409-celB resulted in a specific CelB activity of 2,500 +/- 120 nkat ( pNPGal)/mg(protein) after 28 h. A repeated dosage of the inducer spp-IP did not increase the enzyme expression further. As alternative for the cost intensive MRS medium, a basal whey medium with supplements (yeast extract, Tween 80, NH(4)-citrate) was developed. In bioreactor cultivations using this medium, about 556 +/- 29 nkat ( pNPGal)/mg(protein) of CelB activity was achieved. It was shown that both LAB were potential expression hosts for recombinant enzyme production. The pSIP expression system can be applied in L. casei.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on Candida species implicated in Candida vaginitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research from developing countries, such as Nigeria, on Lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous Lactobacillus species. METHODS: Antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. The in vitro inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated Candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. RESULTS: The maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal Lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/L, 1.36 mmol/L, and 1.72 mg/L respectively. From the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/L; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/L; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/L. The maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. The in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. delbrueckii, and L. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 Candida species tested, while vaginal L. acidophilus and L. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of Candida species in vitro. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
TI  - Double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in newborns weighing <1500 g. METHODS: We studied a group of 150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacteruim infantis, Streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of January 2007 through June 2010. Clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. RESULTS: The primary outcome was the development of NEC. Both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. Blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or Bifidobacteria growth. No differences were detected in terms of NEC risk reduction (RR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.39) although we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of NEC frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. When the combined risk of NEC or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of NEC in preterm newborns.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effects of potential probiotics in a mouse peanut sensitization  model.
AB  - Peanut allergy accounts for the majority of severe food-related allergic reactions and there is a need for new prevention and treatment strategies. Probiotics may be considered for treatment on the basis of their immunomodulating properties. Cytokine profiles of probiotic strains were determined by in vitro co-culture with human PBMCs. Three strains were selected to investigate their prophylactic potential in a peanut sensitization model by analysing peanut-specific antibodies, mast cell degranulation and ex vivo cytokine production by splenocytes. The probiotic strains induced highly variable cytokine profiles in PBMCs. L. salivarius HMI001, L. casei Shirota (LCS) and L. plantarum WCFS1 were selected for further investigation owing to their distinct cytokine patterns. Prophylactic treatment with both HMI001 and LCS attenuated the Th2 phenotype (reduced mast cell responses and ex vivo IL-4 and/or IL-5 production). In contrast, WCFS1 augmented the Th2 phenotype (increased mast cell and antibody responses and ex vivo IL-4 production). In vitro PBMC screening was useful in selecting strains with anti-inflammatory and Th1 skewing properties. In case of HMI001 (high IL-10/IL-12 ratio) and LCS (high interferon-gamma and IL-12), partial protection was seen in a mouse peanut allergy model. Strikingly, certain strains may worsen the allergic reaction as shown in the case of WCFS1.
TI  - Fermentation quality and chemical composition of shrub silage treated with lactic acid bacteria inoculants and cellulase additives.
AB  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculants and cellulase additives on fermentation quality and chemical compositions of shrub silages were studied by using a small-scale fermentation system. Two LAB inoculants of Qingbao (Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilacticii, Lactobacillus casei and Clostridium phage) and Caihe (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus acidilactici) and a commercial cellulase made from Trichoderma reesei were used as additives for intermediate pea-shrub, rush bushclover, arborescent ceratoides and shrubby silage preparation. The crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and water-soluble carbohydrate contents of the four shrub materials were 10.1-14.2, 62.6-67.2 and 1.9-3.5% on a dry matter basis, respectively. All shrub silages had pH 3.40-4.43, ammonia-N 0.1-0.2% g/kg and lactic acid 1.3-2.9% on a fresh matter basis. The silage quality of LAB-inoculated silages did not have a greater effect than control silages, except shrubby silage preparation. Silages treated with the cellulase, the pH of rush bushclover and shrubby sweetvetch silage were significantly (P < 0.05) lower and the lactic acid content were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the control silages. The results confirmed that shrub contained a relatively high content of crude protein; its silages can be preserved in good quality, and they are new potential resources for livestock feed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - Characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in PDO Salers cheese.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making PDO Salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. Gerles from ten farms producing PDO Salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least 4 periods spread over two years. They were distinguished by their levels of Lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log CFU/cm(2)), Gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log CFU/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log CFU/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log CFU/cm(2)). They were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. These 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). The farm gerles were not contaminated by Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. Only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. Even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in the 40 L experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. Using 40 L experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. They were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus hilgardii,...), Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Curtobacterium oceanosedimentum Citrococcus spp., Brachybacterium rhamnosum, Kocuria rhizophila, Arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus). In less than 1 min, even in a 500 L farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.
TI  - Metabolites of Lactobacillus plantarum 2142 prevent oxidative stress-induced overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines in IPEC-J2 cell line.
AB  - Probiotics have already proven beneficial effects in the treatment of several intestinal infections, but the underlying mechanisms how the probiotics can affect responses of porcine IPEC-J2 enterocytes to oxidative stress remained to be elucidated. The immunomodulatory effect of five bacterial strains (Lactobacillus plantarum 2142, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 and Enterococcus faecium CECT 4515) on 1 mM peroxide-triggered upregulation of interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) level was screened by q RT-PCR. Our data revealed that spent culture supernatant (SCS) of L. plantarum 2142 had significant lowering effect on IL-8 and TNF-alpha level with concomitant promoting activity on protective Hsp70 gene expression. According to our results, lactic acid (racemic, D: - and L: -lactic acid) and acetic acid produced by lactobacilli had no protective effect in quenching upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, L. plantarum 2142-specific supernatant peptides were detected by gel electrophoresis and capillary zone electrophoresis.
TI  - Biodiversity of antifungal lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw milk samples from cow, ewe and goat over one-year period.
AB  - Antifungal lactic acid bacteria (ALAB) biodiversity was evaluated in raw milk from ewe, cow and goat over one year period. Lactic acid bacteria were enumerated using 8 semi-selective media, and systematically screened for their antifungal activity against 4 spoilage fungi commonly encountered in dairy products. Depending on the selective medium, between 0.05% (Elliker agar) and 5.5% (LAMVAB agar) screened colonies showed an antifungal activity. The great majority of these active colonies originated from cow (49%) and goat (43%) milks, whereas only 8% were isolated from ewe milk. Penicillium expansum was the most frequently inhibited fungus with 48.5% of colonies active against P. expansum among the 1235 isolated, followed by Mucor plumbeus with 30.6% of active colonies, Kluyveromyces lactis with only 12.1% of active colonies and Pichia anomala with 8.7% of active colonies. In the tested conditions, 94% of the sequenced active colonies belonged to Lactobacillus. Among them, targeted fungal species differed according to the Lactobacillus group, whose presence largely depended on year period and milk origin. The Lb. casei and Lb. reuteri groups, predominantly recovered in summer/fall, were overrepresented in the population targeting M. plumbeus, whereas isolates from the Lb. plantarum group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting K. lactis, the ones belonging to the Lb. buchneri group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting P. anomala. Raw milk, especially cow and goat milks from the summer/fall period appeared to be a productive reservoir for antifungal lactobacilli.
TI  - Newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  - Five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as Weissella cibaria, Enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rRNA sequencing. Essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low pH, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. Efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. Antimicrobial activities against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. Further studies revealed Weissella and Enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. Folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in the human diet. The folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using Lactobacillus casei NCIM 2364 as indicator strain. The three strains of L. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.
TI  - Effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  - Probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with NaCl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. Cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. In some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. Assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (BGP) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. For most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of BGP supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. Growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. Addition of the BGP supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium did not enhance survival to air-drying. Furthermore, addition of BGP to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. This study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.
TI  - Fructooligosaccharides metabolism and effect on bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses.
AB  - Fructo- (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides have been used to promote the growth of probiotics, mainly those from Lactobacillus genus. However, only few reports have evaluated the effect of prebiotics on bacteriocins activity and production. In this work, we characterized the effect of FOS supplementation on the growth, lactic and acetic acids production, and antimicrobial activity of crude extracts obtained from Lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses. Seven out of 28 isolated Lactobacillus, belonging to Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus brevis, showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria innocua. Among them, the strain L. plantarum LE5 showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Enteroccocus faecalis; while the L. plantarum LE27 strain showed antimicrobial effect against L. monocytogenes, E. faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. This antimicrobial activity in most of the cases was obtained only after FOS supplementation. In summary, these results show the feasibility to increase the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus bacteriocins by supplementing the growth medium with FOS.
TI  - Acid production and growth by oral Lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral Lactobacillus species. METHODS: Thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of Lactobacillus, representing nine species, including Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. Anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (pH 7.0). Acid production and growth were measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. RESULTS: Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species. They also produced more acid than the others. Lactobacillus vaginalis showed the lowest rate of growth and acid production. These findings demonstrated that the different species of Lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. CONCLUSION: There was variation in acid production and growth between the Lactobacillus species. The strongest acid producers were Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. It seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.
TI  - Manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - This work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to Fior di Latte (high-moisture cow milk Mozzarella) cheese. First, 18 probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus reuteri were screened. Resistance to heating (65 or 55 degrees C for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. Adaptation at 42 degrees C for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees C for 10 min of all probiotic lactobacilli. Heat-adapted L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 227.4 min) and L. paracasei BGP1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for the manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese. Two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (Streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. As determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR and 16S rRNA gene analyses, the cell density of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 in chemically or biologically acidified Fior di Latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. Microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of Fior di Latte cheeses.
TI  - Biodiversity of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria in the fermentation of "Shanxi aged vinegar", a traditional Chinese vinegar.
AB  - Shanxi aged vinegar is a famous traditional Chinese vinegar made from several kinds of cereal by spontaneous solid-state fermentation techniques. In order to get a comprehensive understanding of culturable microorganism's diversity present in its fermentation, the indigenous microorganisms including 47 yeast isolates, 28 lactic acid bacteria isolates and 58 acetic acid bacteria isolates were recovered in different fermenting time and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including inter-delta/PCR, PCR-RFLP, ERIC/PCR analysis, as well as 16S rRNA and 26S rRNA partial gene sequencing. In the alcoholic fermentation, the dominant yeast species Saccharomyces (S.) cerevisiae (96%) exhibited low phenotypic and genotypic diversity among the isolates, while Lactobacillus (Lb.) fermentum together with Lb. plantarum, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Pediococcus (P.) acidilactici, P. pentosaceus and Weissella confusa were predominated in the bacterial population at the same stage. Acetobacter (A.) pasteurianus showing great variety both in genotypic and phenotypic tests was the dominant species (76%) in the acetic acid fermentation stage, while the other acetic acid bacteria species including A. senegalensis, A. indonesiensis, A. malorum and A. orientalis, as well as Gluconobacter (G.) oxydans were detected at initial point of alcoholic and acetic acid fermentation stage respectively.
TI  - Does the applicability of Bacillus strains in probiotics rely upon their taxonomy?
AB  - The taxonomic position and biological activities of two Bacillus strains used in  veterinary probiotics were studied in this work. These microorganisms inhibit growth of a broad spectrum of pathogenic cultures. They synthesize proteolytic enzymes and other biologically active metabolites, and to some extent, supplement each other with probiotic activities. It is not clear whether these versatile activities are properties of individual strains or bacterial taxa as whole. 16S rRNA comparisons were conducted and illustrated the relatedness of these strains to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens . Their cell wall fatty acid contents were consequently analysed and specified a relation to the " Bacillus velezensis " ecomorph. On account of the previous observations, a simple method of 16S rRNA profiling by polymorphic nucleotides was proposed to determine a group of organisms closely related to "B. velezensis" and B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum, for they are biologically active strains suitable for use in biotechnology. The extreme genetic plasticity of these bacteria endowed each strain with a unique spectrum of antagonistic activity.
TI  - Probiotic features of two oral Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - In this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. Samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (G1) and L. casei (G3). Both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of Candida albicans. The bacteriocin activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6358-P was shown only by L. plantarum G1. Moreover, the isolates G1 and G3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. The viability of G1 and G3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. The biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated Wistar rats, compared to control ones. No toxicity for NMRI Ham mice was observed. According to our experimental results, these findings imply that L. plantarum G1 and L. casei G3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.
TI  - A third-generation esterase inoculant alters fermentation pattern and improves aerobic stability of barley silage and the efficiency of body weight gain of growing feedlot cattle.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of a mixed bacterial inoculant possessing ferulic acid esterase (FAE) activity on silage fermentation characteristics, aerobic stability, and growth performance of growing feedlot steers. Whole-crop barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) forage (35% DM) was chopped and ensiled without a silage inoculant (UN) or with a mixed bacterial culture containing 1.0 x 10(11) cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri LN4017 that produces FAE, 2.0 x 10(10) cfu/g of Lactobacillus plantarum LP7109, and 1.0 x 10(10) cfu/g of Lactobacillus casei LC3200 at a combined rate of 1.3 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh forage (IN) in mini and Ag-Bag (Ag-Bag Int. Ltd., Warrenton, OR) silos. Silages from the mini silos were assessed for the effect of inoculation on fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability, whereas silages from Ag-Bags were used to formulate 2 barley silage-based total mixed rations (UN and IN) that were fed to growing feedlot steers for 112 d. The IN silage exhibited a homolactic fermentation during the first 7 d of ensiling as reflected by an increased (P </= 0.02) lactic acid concentration and an accelerated rate (P < 0.01) of pH decline. Thereafter, fermentation of IN silage became more heterolactic, resulting in greater concentrations of acetic acid (P < 0.01) and pH (P < 0.01) but less (P < 0.01) lactic acid than UN silage. Inoculation did not affect DM losses (P = 0.52) from mini silos. The IN silage remained stable during 21 d, but temperature and yeasts counts in the UN silage increased after 5 d of aerobic exposure. Growing steers fed the IN silage diet had superior (P = 0.03) feed conversion efficiency compared with those fed UN silage. Inoculation of whole-crop barley silage with a mixed culture of homolactic lactic acid-producing bacteria and FAE-producing L. buchneri at ensiling changed fermentation from a homolactic to a heterolactic form during ensiling and improved aerobic stability of the silage and efficiency of BW gain of growing feedlot steers.
TI  - Comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  - There is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. The present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) model in vitro. Live cells of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei Shirota, L. rhamnosus GG, L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 and L. reuteri NCIMB 11951) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum SP 07/3 and B. bifidum MF 20/5) were individually incubated with PBMC from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. Probiotic strains increased the proportion of CD69+ on lymphocytes, T cells, T cell subsets and natural killer (NK) cells, and increased the proportion of CD25+, mainly on lymphocytes and NK cells. The effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. NK cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. Probiotic strains increased production of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 or TNF-beta. The cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included IL-10, interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-12p70, IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. The Lactobacillus strains tended to promote T helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. The results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to T cell and NK cell activation or NK cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of an Amazon medicinal plant (Chancapiedra) (Phyllanthus niruri L.) against Helicobacter pylori and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The potential of water extracts of the Amazon medicinal plant Chancapiedra (Phyllanthus niruri L.) from Ecuador and Peru for antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori and different strains of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum was investigated. H. pylori was inhibited by both water extracts in a dose dependent manner, whereas lactic acid bacterial growth was not affected. Both extracts contained ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and exhibited high free radical scavenging linked-antioxidant activities (89%). However, gallic acid was detected only in the Ecuadorian extract. Preliminary studies on the mode of action of Chancapiedra against H. pylori revealed that inhibition may not involve proline dehydrogenase-based oxidative phosphorylation inhibition associated with simple mono-phenolics and could involve ellagitannins or other non-phenolic compounds through a yet unknown mechanism. This study provides evidence about the potential of Chancapiedra for H. pylori inhibition without affecting beneficial lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in Inner Mongolia of China.
AB  - Sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of Inner Mongolia in China.  It has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. In this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in Inner Mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by classical biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay of recA gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor Tu). The results revealed that all the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) paracasei (38 strains), L. fermentum (28 strains), L. plantarum (7 strains), L. brevis (4 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. amylolyticus (1 strain), Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (3 strains), E. italicus (2 strains) or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). The predominant LAB were L. casei and L. fermentum in sour congee samples. The diversity of LAB derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and RFLP patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the L. casei group.
TI  - Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  - The health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. Here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). Most lactobacilli strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong IL-12 and TNF-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. In contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low IL-12 and TNF-alpha inducers. IL-10 and IL-6 levels showed less variation and no correlation with IL-12 and TNF-alpha. DC matured by strong IL-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (IFN)-beta. When combining two strains, low IL-12 inducers inhibited this IFN-beta production as well as IL-12 and Th1-skewing chemokines. The IFN-beta induction was mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) irrespective of the stimulating strain. The inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-Jun dimerization protein (JDP)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of JNK. Our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects. This underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.
TI  - Macrolide resistance and in vitro selection of resistance to antibiotics in Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - Spreading of resistance to antibiotics is of great concern due to the increasing  rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. Since commensal bacteria may transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on development of resistance should include also lactobacilli. Resistance to macrolides, penicillins and tetracycline was determined in 40 isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Lactobacillus casei isolated from faeces of apparently healthy volunteers. Frequency of mutation and changes in susceptibility after serial exposure to these antibiotics at concentrations of 4x and 8x MIC were evaluated in susceptible isolates. Acquired resistance was defined as an increment in MIC values of at least four times in respect to the pre-selection values. Resistance to macrolides and/or tetracycline was identified in 14 and 4 isolates, respectively. ermB gene and A2058G mutation in 23S rRNA were detected in macrolide resistant isolates. Frequencies of mutation of susceptible isolates (n=26) were lower for ampicillin and erythromycin than for tetracycline. Serial exposure to antibiotics led to selection of resistant mutants. However, acquired resistance was rather unstable and was lost after subcultures in antibiotic-free medium in most mutants. Resistance to erythromycin was associated to a A2058G mutation in 23S rRNA. In conclusion, results indicate that resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is present among intestinal lactobacilli. Decrease in susceptibility following serial exposure to antibiotics might occur in lactobacilli, in a strain- and antibiotic-dependent way. Since lactobacilli are often used as probiotics, their ability to acquire resistance should be evaluated for isolates candidate to be included in probiotics based products.
TI  - Microbiological and chemical characterisation of ting, a sorghum-based sourdough  product from Botswana.
AB  - Ting is a fermented sorghum product of Botswana which is used to prepare porridges of different consistencies. This study aimed to characterise ting with respect to fermentation microbiota and metabolite composition, and to develop starter cultures for ting fermentation. The pH values of 10 ting samples from Botswana ranged between 3.5 and 4.0 and cell counts ranged between 1.2x10(8) and 1.2x10(10)cfu/g lactic acid bacteria. Yeast cell counts were below 10(5)cfu/g in all samples and Enterobacteriaceae were less than 10 cfu/g. The microbiota of samples consisted of 2-4 dominant strains and strains were identified based on the sequence of their 16S rRNA genes as Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus harbinensis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus coryniformis. Binary strain combinations were employed as starter cultures to produce ting. Major fermentation products were lactate, acetate and ethanol, additionally, 1,2 propanediol and 1,3 propanediol were produced by some strains. All strains were capable of producing ting, which was accompanied by a decrease in pH from 6.3 to 4 within 8h. Traditionally processed ting requires 2 to 3 days to attain a pH below 4; the starter cultures thus reduced the fermentation time to 8h.
TI  - Effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  - Food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. This study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape seed extract (GSE) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a GSE fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (GSE-M). On the other hand, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the GSE fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (GSE-O) fraction. Within bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas Bifidobacterium breve 26M2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum HDD541 reached maximum growth in presence of GSE-O and GSE-M fractions. Metabolism of flavan-3-ols by LAB and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. The results revealed that only L. plantarum IFPL935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. An unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in L. plantarum IFPL935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as an Effective Probiotic for Murine Giardiasis.
AB  - The gut microflora is an important constituent in the intestinal mucosal barrier  and has been introduced as the concept of probiotic therapy that beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to explore the protective potential of various lactobacilli strains for murine giardiasis. By experimentation, it was found that the probiotic supplementation of either Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, or L. rhamnosus GG, 7 days prior to inoculation with G. lamblia trophozoites, reduced the rate of cyst excretion compared with Giardia-infected mice. Interestingly, L. GG was found to be the most effective probiotic in reducing the duration of giardia cycle and acts as an effective prophylactic probiotic for murine giardiasis but needs to be clinically correlated due to entirely different human microflora.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Modulation of Th1/Th2 balance by Lactobacillus strains isolated from Kimchi via stimulation of macrophage cell line J774A.1 in vitro.
AB  - Lactobacilli isolated from Kimchi, a Korean traditional food, were tested for their capacity to modulate the T helper (Th) 1/Th2 balance. Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mouse splenocytes were cultured with 26 strains of lactobacilli; the highest IL-12 induction and lowest IL-4 production were then observed in 4 strains, including Lactobacillus plantarum CJLP55, CJLP56, CJLP133, and CJLP136. These strains produced a larger amount of IL-12, which enhances differentiation and activation of Th1 cells, in macrophage cell-lines more than positive control strains L. casei KCTC 3109(T) and L. rhamnosus GG, although they also induced production of IL-10, which is a suppressor of IL-12. Indeed, CJLP133-stimulated macrophages induced production of more Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma and less Th2 cytokine IL-4 than KCTC 3109(T) and GG in co-cultivation with T cells. These findings suggest that lactobacilli from Kimchi may modulate the Th1/Th2 balance via macrophage activation in the hypersensitive reaction caused by Th2 cells. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Allergic reactions including asthma and atopy are caused by predominance of Th2 response over Th1 response. Lactobacilli isolated from fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese, and Kimchi showed health-promoting activities. The present study indicated that several lactobacilli strains from Kimchi may reduce allergic reactions through macrophage-mediated induction of Th1 response.
TI  - [Genetic diversity of the genus Lactobacillus bacteria from the human gastrointestinal microbiome].
AB  - The species and strain genetic diversity of bacterial cultures belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, which were isolated from the gastrointestinal microbiome of the human population living in the former Soviet Union in the years 1960-1980, was studied. The bacteria demonstrated probiotic characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the gene coding for 16S rRNA detected earlier by us, showed that the gene found in bacteria isolated from the intestinal content of healthy adults and represented by species L. plantarum, L. helveticus, L. casei/paracasei, L. rhamnosus, and L. fermentum has high homology (97-100%) with this gene in type representatives of the species. The genotypic and strain diversity of cultures was studied using RAPD-PCR and nonspecific primers. This method with the use of the ERIC-1 primer gave reliable and reproducible results as compared that using with M13 and MSP primers and allowed the identification of examined bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus at the level of species and certification at the strain level.
TI  - [Species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacillus in infants].
AB  - AIM: To study species composition and antibiotic resistance of indigenous bacteria from Lactobacillus genus in infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six strains of lactobacilli isolated from feces of infants living in Kazan. Species membership of lactobacilli was determined using PCR with primers for identification of 7 species of lactobacilli: L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. zeae. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by indicator paper discs method. RESULTS. In breastfed infants L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus dominated, whereas in artificially fed infants colonization with L. casei and L. paracasei was characteristic. L.acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. zeae were not detected in infants. In 6 cases isolates could be identified only to genus characteristic. Lactobacilli were polyresistant and had from 8 to 15 markers of resistance. All strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, nitroxoline, metronidazole, furazolidone, and 95% of strains were resistant to vancomycin. In 60-70% of cases lactobacilli were susceptible to penicillin, linezolid, erythromycin and lyncomycin. CONCLUSION: Regional features of species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli in infants depending on type of feeding were revealed.
TI  - [Comparative clinical efficacy of a probiotic vs. an antibiotic in the treatment  of patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic abdominal functional distension: a pilot study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) are usually treated with different antibiotics. Certain probiotics have proved to be clinically effective in patients with abdominal distension. OBJECTIVE: To compare the short-term clinical efficacy of metronidazol vs. a probiotic in patients with SIBO and functional chronic abdominal distension. Patients and methods. This was a randomized prospective pilot study. The study population consisted of 50 patients with chronic abdominal distension (Rome III criteria) and diagnosis of SIBO made by a lactulose H2 breath test. Patients were consecutively randomized to receive either metronidazol or a probiotic. The metronidazol group consisted of 25 subjects (23 women, median age 49 +/- 19 years old), who received metronidazol (Flagyl), 500 mg bid for 5 days. The probiotic group consisted of 25 subjects (20 women, median age 58 +/- 19 years old). The probiotic administered to the latter group contained Lactobacillus casei (3.3 x 10(7) UFC), Lactobacillus plantarum (3.3 x 10(7) UFC), Streptococcus faecalis (3.3 x 10(7) UFC) and Bifidobacterium brevis (1.0 x 10(6) UFC) (Bioflora) and 5 ml bid were administered for 5 days. Both groups went on the same diet, which consisted in reduced consumption of alcohol, legumes, dairy products and leafy green vegetables. Response to treatment was assessed by an independent questioner 15 days post treatment. A five-level overall response questionnaire was used. Responses included much better, better, the same, worse, and much worse. Better and much better were considered positive responses. RESULTS: Thirteen (52%) subjects receiving metronidazol and 20 (82%) receiving the probiotic referred clinical improvement after the treatment. A statistically significant difference favoured the use of the probiotic (P = 0.036). All the study patients completed treatment. No adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this pilot study results, we can suggest that the probiotic herein used has a higher efficacy than metronidazol in the early clinical response of patients with chronic abdominal distension and SIBO.
TI  - Simplification of a complex microbial antilisterial consortium to evaluate the contribution of its flora in uncooked pressed cheese.
AB  - A complex microbial consortium derived from raw milk and composed of populations  classified in 4 groups (lactic acid bacteria (A), Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (B), Gram negative bacteria (C) and yeasts (D)) can contribute to the inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes in the core of an uncooked pressed cheese. To identify what groups may be involved in the inhibition, the consortium was simplified by successively omitting one group at a time. Pasteurized milk was inoculated with these more or less complex consortia and their effects on L. monocytogenes count, pH, acids and volatile compounds in the core of uncooked pressed cheese were evaluated. The growth of L. monocytogenes was the highest in cheeses prepared with pasteurized milk and only St. thermophilus. Inhibition in other cheeses was expressed by comparison with growth in these ones. All the consortia containing both lactic acid bacteria (group A) and Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (group B)--ABCD, ABD, ABC, AB--were more inhibitory than those containing lactic acid bacteria on its own (A) or associated only with yeasts (AD) or/and Gram negative (ADC). Consortia without lactic acid bacteria were weakly inhibitory or had no effect. Gram positive catalase positive bacteria alone were not inhibitory although most of the species became established in the cheeses. The Lactobacillus population (Lb. casei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. curvatus and Lb. farciminis) was predominant in cheeses (9 log CFU/g) with a higher count than Leuconostoc (7 log CFU/g) and Enterococcus (7 log CFU/g). Lactobacillus counts were negatively correlated with those of L. monocytogenes (r=-0.84 at 18 days) and with the level of D-lactic acid. There was no correlation between L. monocytogenes and Leuconostoc or Enterococcus counts. Complex consortium ABCD and AB not only had a stronger inhibitory power in cheeses than consortium AD, they were also associated with the highest levels of L-lactic and acetic acids. All cheeses inoculated with lactic acid bacteria differed from those without by higher levels of ethyl formiate, pentane and alcohols (2-butanol, 2-pentanol), and lower levels of ketones (2-hexanone, 2,3-butanedione) and aldehydes (2-methyl-butanal). Levels of 2-methyl-butanal, 2-butanol and 2-pentanol were higher in ABCD and AB cheeses than in AD cheeses. Beside their contribution to the inhibition, their effect on cheese flavour must be evaluated.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Strain-specific immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus plantarum strains on birch-pollen-allergic subjects out of season.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases are increasing world-wide, and according to the hygiene hypothesis may be related to a decreased exposure to environmental bacteria. Probiotic bacteria are recognized for their immunomodulating properties, and may benefit allergy patients. In vitro studies reveal immunomodulatory effects that are strain dependent. Differential immunomodulatory in vitro capacities cannot be extrapolated directly to in vivo efficacy. Thus, in vitro screening should preferably be followed by a comparative analysis of the selected immunomodulatory strains in an in vivo setting. OBJECTIVE: We selected five Lactobacillus strains on their IL-10-inducing capacity, and evaluated the immunomodulatory properties in birch-pollen-allergic subjects outside the hayfever season, with a reduction of IL-13 as the primary outcome. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study was performed in which 62 subjects with a proven birch-pollen allergy consumed one of five different probiotic yoghurts containing four Lactobacillus plantarum strains and one Lactobacillus casei strain or a placebo yoghurt. Blood samples were collected at the start and after 4 weeks. Several immune parameters were determined in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures (PBMC) derived from these subjects. Results A decrease in birch-pollen-specific IgE was found for four probiotic strains. L. casei Shirota reduced the number of CD16(+) /CD56(+) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For strain L. plantarum CBS125632, the decrease in IgE coincided with significant decreases in IL-5 and IL-13 production by alphaCD3/alphaCD28-stimulated PBMC cultures. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Subjects with seasonal allergy can be used to determine immunomodulatory responses outside the pollen season within a 4-week study period. L. plantarum CBS125632 decreased several immune markers related to allergy, and may have the potential to alleviate the severity of seasonal allergy symptoms.
TI  - Isoflavone phytoestrogens in soymilk fermented with beta-glucosidase producing probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Isoflavones significantly contribute to human health and disease prevention, and  exist as glucosides and aglycones. The beta-glucosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosides to aglycones is very sensitive to molecular structure, and thus the profile of the isoflavones can affect their rate of hydrolysis. Soymilk was fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus B4496 (La), Lactobacillus bulgaricus CFR2028 (Lb), Lactobacillus casei B1922 (Lc), Lactobacillus plantarum B4495 (Lp) and Lactobacillus fermentum B4655 (Lf) for 48 h at 37 degrees C. beta-Glucosidase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis was carried out in soymilk. During fermentation, maximum growth was seen at 24 h with Lb, Lc, Lp and Lf and at 48 h with La. Polyphenol content ranged from 12.98 to 17.90 at 24 h and from 12.44 to 15.24 mg/100 ml at 48 h of fermentation. All the lactic acid bacteria produced beta-glucosidase enzyme, which hydrolyzed isoflavone glucosides to aglycones at a significant level (P < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk.
TI  - [Classification of domestic probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus genus].
AB  - AIM: To study strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus genus using combination of microbiological and molecular biological methods in order to define more accurately their systematic position and biochemical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen cultures of Lactobacillus bacteria isolated from stool of healthy persons were studied: L. plantarum CS 396, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum 421-2, L. fermentum 90-TC-4, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526, L. acidophilus Er 317/402 NARINE, L. acidophilus 100 ash, L. acidophilus NK-1, L. acidophilus NNIE, L. acidophilus K3sh24, L. brevis gKNM 23 11, L. casei gKNM 577. Their enzymatic activity relative to 50 sugars was studied using API-50 system. Structure of proximal region of 16S rRNA gene was studied also. RESULTS: According to results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis strains were divided on 2 groups: 1) L. casei gKNM 577, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum CS 396, which species belonging corresponded to stated description. Comparison of nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene of group 2 strains with nucleotide sequences database revealed that cultures NK-1, Er315/402 NARINE, 100 ash, NNIE identified early as L. acidophilus belong to species L. helveticus; L. brevis gKNM 23 and L. acidophilus K3sh24--to group L. casei/paracasei, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101 and L. fermentum 90-TC-4--to L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526--to L. fermentum, and L. plantarum 421-2--to L. rhamnosus. CONCLUSION: Obtained data allowed to perform taxonomic reclassification of species belonging of studied probiotic cultures of lactobacilli according to modem level of systematic of bacteria.
TI  - Protective effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in mice.
AB  - AIMS: The anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 (DT104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation after oral infection with DT104 during fosfomycin (FOM) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS), which is naturally resistant to FOM, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. Comparison of the anti-Salmonella activity of several Lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to FOM revealed that Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 14869(T) , Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917(T) , Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112(T) , Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469(T) and Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741(T) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as LcS, Lact. casei ATCC 334(T) and Lactobacillus zeae ATCC 15820(T) . The increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower pH in the intestine because of Lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. Moreover, heat-killed LcS was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug resistant pathogens, such as DT104. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Antibiotics such as FOM disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.
TI  - FTIR-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Greek Graviera cheese.
AB  - This study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (Fourier Transformed Infra-Red [FTIR] spectroscopy) and molecular (RFLP and SSCP analysis of 16S rRNA genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora present in traditional Greek Graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. A total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of TSAYE (incubated at 30 degrees C), M-17 (22 degrees C) and M-17 (42 degrees C) agar media were clustered by FTIR and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by all methods. Based on their FTIR spectra, 282 isolates were LAB grouped in 28 clusters. The LAB species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), Enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and Lactococcus lactis (0.7%). Also, Staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), Corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and Brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from TSAYE. Comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the LAB species identified. The present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid FTIR screening of 10-fold more isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant LAB species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.
TI  - Diversity of stress tolerance in Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus  and Lactobacillus paraplantarum: A multivariate screening study.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of the taxonomically related species Lactobacillus plantarum  subsp. plantarum, L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, L. paraplantarum and L. pentosus isolated from sourdoughs and other food and non-food sources and 14 strains of other members of the genus Lactobacillus were screened for their tolerance of acid, alkaline, heat, oxidative, osmotic, detergent and starvation stresses in order to evaluate the diversity of stress response. Most strains of the L. plantarum group were highly tolerant of acid, alkaline and osmotic stress and highly sensitive to detergent stress, while a larger diversity was found for other stress. Multivariate analysis allowed grouping the strains in clusters with similar response patterns. Stress response patterns in the L. plantarum group were similar to those of species of the L. casei/L. paracasei group but clearly different from those of other mesophilic Lactobacillus. No relationship was found between grouping obtained on the basis of stress response patterns and by genotypic fingerprinting (rep-PCR), nor with the taxonomic position or isolation source of the strains. Further experiments with selected strains showed that exponential phase cells were generally but not always more sensitive than stationary phase cells. The ability to grow under stressful conditions showed a slightly better correlation with the ecological conditions prevailing in the isolation niches of the strains. This study will be the basis for further investigations to identify and exploit the basis of diversity in the stress response of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  - The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. Lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. These species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. Bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only Bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. Bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.
TI  - Two strains of nonstarter lactobacilli increased the production of flavor compounds in soft cheeses.
AB  - The contribution to flavor generation and secondary proteolysis of 2 strains of mesophilic lactobacilli isolated from cheese was studied. Miniature soft cheeses (200 g) were produced with or without the inclusion of a culture of Lactobacillus plantarum I91 or Lactobacillus casei I90 in the starter composed of Streptococcus thermophilus. During ripening, cheeses containing the added lactobacilli showed an increased content of total free amino acids, but this increase was only significant in cheeses with Lb. plantarum I91. In addition, free amino acid profiles were modified by selective increases of some amino acids, such as Asp, Ser, Arg, Leu, and Phe. Cheeses inoculated with Lb. plantarum I91 or Lb. casei I90 were also characterized by a significantly higher concentration of diacetyl, a key flavor compound, and an increased content of acetoin. Results suggest an increase in the catabolism of either citrate or aspartate, with the production of the derived aroma compounds. Overall, aspartate content increased in both lactobacilli-added cheeses, whereas citrate was more or less constant, suggesting that aspartate could be the source of increased diacetyl and acetoin. A triangle aroma test showed that the addition of the lactobacilli strains significantly changed the sensory attributes of cheeses. At least 11 of 12 panelists commented that the aroma of cheeses with adjuncts was more buttery than that of control cheeses, which is desirable in most soft cheeses. Both Lb. plantarum I91 and Lb. casei I90 performed well as adjunct cultures by influencing cheese aroma development and cheese proteolysis.
TI  - Coexpression of bile salt hydrolase gene and catalase gene remarkably improves oxidative stress and bile salt resistance in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) encounter various types of stress during industrial processes and gastrointestinal transit. Catalase (CAT) and bile salt hydrolase (BSH) can protect bacteria from oxidative stress or damage caused by bile salts by decomposing hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or deconjugating the bile salts, respectively. Lactobacillus casei is a valuable probiotic strain and is often deficient in both CAT and BSH. In order to improve the resistance of L. casei to both oxidative and bile salts stress, the catalase gene katA from L. sakei and the bile salt hydrolase gene bsh1 from L. plantarum were coexpressed in L. casei HX01. The enzyme activities of CAT and BSH were 2.41 mumol H(2)O(2)/min/10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) and 2.11 mumol glycine/min/ml in the recombinant L. casei CB, respectively. After incubation with 8 mM H(2)O(2), survival ratio of L. casei CB was 40-fold higher than that of L. casei CK. Treatment of L. casei CB with various concentrations of sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) showed that ~10(5) CFU/ml cells survived after incubation with 0.5% GDCA, whereas almost all the L. casei CK cells were killed when treaded with 0.4% GDCA. These results indicate that the coexpression of CAT and BSH confers high-level resistance to both oxidative and bile salts stress conditions in L. casei HX01.
TI  - New method for electroporation of Lactobacillus species grown in high salt.
AB  - We here describe a new method for electroporation of Lactobacillus species, obligately homofermentative and facultatively heterofermentative, based on the cell-wall weakening resulting from growth in high-salt media. For L. casei, optimum transformation efficiency of up to 10(5) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA was achieved following growth in the presence of 0.9 M NaCl. Plasmids of different sizes and replication origins were also similarly transformed. These competent cells could be used either directly or stored frozen, up to 1 month, for future use, with similar efficiency. This protocol was assayed with different Lactobacillus species: L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and L. acidophilus, and it was found that they were transformed with similar efficiency.
TI  - Phytase activity from Lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.
AB  - The presence of phytate in calcium-fortified soymilk may interfere with mineral absorption. Certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce the enzyme phytase that degrades phytates and therefore may potentially improve mineral bioavailability and absorption. This study investigates the phytase activity and phytate degradation potential of 7 strains of LAB including: Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4962, ATCC33200, ATCC4356, ATCC4161, L. casei ASCC290, L. plantarum ASCC276, and L. fermentum VRI-003. Activity of these bacteria was examined both in screening media and in calcium-fortified soymilk supplemented with potassium phytate. Most strains produced phytase under both conditions with L. acidophilus ATCC4161 showing the highest activity. Phytase activity in fortified soymilk fermented with L. acidophilus ATCC4962 and L. acidophilus ATCC4161 increased by 85% and 91%, respectively, between 12 h and 24 h of fermentation. All strains expressed peak phytase activity at approximately pH 5. However, no phytate degradation could be observed.
TI  - Microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
AB  - The diversity, dynamics and activity of Castelmagno PDO cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the Grana Valley (northwest Italy), during the wintertime. Samples of milk, curd and cheese (core and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. In particular, DNA and RNA directly extracted from the matrices were studied by PCR-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-DGGE. Culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species Streptococcus thermophilus and S. agalactiae. Then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with Lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of Castelmagno PDO ripening. At this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lb. casei. Culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of L. lactis, actively involved in both Castelmagno PDO manufacturing and ripening. Despite Lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a DGGE band referred to this microorganism was detected, at RNA level, in samples from ripened cheeses. On the other hand, Lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. Due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
TI  - Tyrosine- and histidine-decarboxylase positive lactic acid bacteria and enterococci in dry fermented sausages.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and enterococci were isolated immediately after stuffing (day 0), at the end of ripening (28th day) and at the end of storage (112th day) from dry fermented sausages produced by two different producers (K; R) in two diameters (4.5 and 7 cm) using either of two spice mixtures (P; H) and either of two starter cultures (Pediococcus pentosaceus, C; Lactobacillus curvatus+Staphylococcus carnosus, F), resulting in a total of 16 different combinations. Tyrosine-decarboxylase DNA sequence (tyrdc) was identified on average in 88% and 44% of enterococci and LAB isolates, respectively at the end of ripening, the corresponding figures regarding histidine-decarboxylase gene sequence (hisdc) was 71% and 16%, respectively. Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis and L. casei/paracasei, and Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as tyramine/histamine producers in the sausages.
TI  - Robustness of Lactobacillus plantarum starters during daily propagation of wheat  flour sourdough type I.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the robustness of selected sourdough strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Seven strains were singly used as sourdough type I starters under daily back-slopping propagation (ten days) using wheat flour. Cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied slightly (median values of 9.13-9.46 log cfu g(-1)) between and within started sourdoughs, as well as the acidifying activity (median values of 1.24-1.33). After three days also the control sourdough (unstarted) had the same values. As shown by RAPD-PCR analysis, five (DB200, 3DM, G10C3, 12H1 and LP20) out of seven strains maintained elevated cell numbers (ca. 9 log cfu g(-1)) throughout ten days. The other two strains progressively decreased to less than 5 log cfu g(-1). As identified by partial sequencing of 16S rRNA and recA genes, L. plantarum (11 isolates), pediococci (7), Lactobacillus casei (3) and Lactobacillus rossiae (2) dominated the flour microbiota. Monitoring of lactic acid bacteria during sourdough propagation was carried out by culture dependent approach and using PCR-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis). Except for the sourdough started with L. plantarum LP20, in all other sourdoughs at least one autochthonous strain of L. plantarum emerged. All emerging strains of L. plantarum showed different RAPD-PCR profiles. L. rossiae and Pediococcus pentosaceus were only found in the control and sourdough started with strain 12H1. The characterization of the catabolic profiles of sourdoughs (Biolog System) showed that sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and their profiles were clearly differentiated from the others. One persistent strain (DB200) of L. plantarum and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis LS44, previously shown to be persistent (Siragusa et al., 2009), were used as the mixed starter to produce a wheat flour sourdough. Both strains cohabited and dominated during ten days of propagation.
TI  - The effect of ripening and storage conditions on the distribution of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine in Edam-cheese.
AB  - The aim of the work was to describe the development of selected biogenic amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine) in 4 layers of Dutch-type cheese (Edam-cheese) depending on 3 ripening/storage regimes during a 98-day period. Biogenic amines were analysed by means of ion-exchange chromatography. A further goal was to identify microbial sources of biogenic amines in the material analysed. Phenotype characterization and repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting were used to identify the isolated bacteria. The highest content of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine was determined in cheeses stored in a ripening cellar at a temperature of 10 degrees C during the whole observation period. Lower biogenic amines content was determined in samples which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees C) after 38 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees C). The lowest concentrations of biogenic amines were detected in cheeses which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees C) after 23 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees C). During the 98-day period, histamine was not detected in any of the regimes. Within the cheeses analysed, non-starter lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum were detected as the main producers of the biogenic amines tested. In starter bacteria Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris the decarboxylase activity tested was not detected.
TI  - Microbial products from probiotic bacteria inhibit Salmonella enteritidis 857-induced IL-8 synthesis in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Oral administration of Lactobacillus spp. as probiotics is gaining importance in  the treatment of intestinal inflammations. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. We investigated whether nonspecific binding Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) and mannose-specific Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp) and their spent culture supernatant (SCS) affect Salmonella enteritidis 857 (Se) growth, IL-8 and Hsp70 syntheses. In one set of experiments human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells were infected with LcS, Lp or Se at 1-500 bacteria per cell for 1 h. In another set, cells were exposed to Se (0-200 per cell, 1 h) after exposure to lactobacilli (LB) (500 per cell, 30 min) or by co-incubation of Se and LB (1 h). The third set of experiments involved exposure of cells for 1 h to SCS or Se (100 per cell) pretreated (1 h) in SCS. The effect of LB SCS on Se growth was evaluated by agar plate diffusion test. IL-8 and Hsp70 were assessed over 2-24 h using ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. Neither LcS nor Lp affected the Se growth and IL-8 production. In addition, they did not induce Hsp70 expression by Caco-2 cells. Instead, their SCS inhibited the Se growth and IL-8 production and induced the expression of Hsp70 by both crypt- and villus-like cells. The beneficial effect of Lactobacillus spp. to the intestinal inflammations might be associated with a decrease in IL-8 levels. This effect could be mediated, at least in part, via a secreted antimicrobial product(s) either directly against the pathogens or indirectly through the synthesis of Hsp70.
TI  - Phenolic acids and flavonoids in nonfermented and fermented red sorghum (Sorghum  bicolor (L.) Moench).
AB  - This study aimed to identify phenolic acids and flavonoids in the red sorghum variety PAN 3860 and to determine changes in their concentrations during fermentation with lactobacilli. Sorghum sourdoughs fermented with two binary strain combinations, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus reuteri , were compared to chemically acidified controls. Four glycerol esters were tentatively identified, caffeoylglycerol, dicaffeoylglycerol, coumaroyl-caffeoylglycerol, and coumaroyl-feruloylglycerol, that have previously not been detected in sorghum. Chemical acidification resulted in hydrolysis of phenolic acid esters and flavonoid glucosides. During lactic fermentation, phenolic acids, phenolic acid esters, and flavonoid glucosides were metabolized. Analysis of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and naringenin-glucoside contents in single-strain cultures of lactobacilli demonstrated that glucosidase, phenolic acid reductase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase activities contributed to polyphenol metabolism. This study demonstrates that microbial fermentation of sorghum affects the content of polyphenols and can influence the nutritional value and antimicrobial activity of sorghum.
TI  - Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  - The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.
TI  - Bioconversion of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and  vitamin B complex in fermented soymilk by probiotic bacteria and yeast.
AB  - AIM: To study the role of beta-glucosidase producing probiotic bacteria and yeast in the biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and vitamin B complex in fermented soymilk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five isolates of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus B4496, Lactobacillus bulgaricus CFR2028, Lactobacillus casei B1922, Lactobacillus plantarum B4495 and Lactobacillus fermentum B4655 with yeast Saccharomyces boulardii were used to ferment soymilk to obtain the bioactive isoflavones, genistein and daidzein. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the concentration of isoflavones. Bioactive aglycones genistein and daidzein after 24 and 48 h of fermentation ranged from 97.49 to 98.49% and 62.71 to 92.31% respectively with different combinations of LAB with yeast. Increase in bioavailability of minerals and vitamin B complex were also observed in fermented soymilk. CONCLUSIONS: LAB in combination with yeast S. boulardii has great potential for the enrichment of bioactive isoflavones, enhancing the viability of LAB strains, decreasing the antinutrient phytic acid and increasing the mineral bioavailability in soymilk fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Fermentation of soymilk with probiotic organisms improves the bioavailability of isoflavones, assists in digestion of protein, provides more soluble calcium, enhances intestinal health and supports immune system. Increased isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk improves the biological functionality of soymilk.
TI  - Intragastric administration of a superoxide dismutase-producing recombinant Lactobacillus casei BL23 strain attenuates DSS colitis in mice.
AB  - Human immune cells release large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide via respiratory burst. In inflammatory bowel diseases, a sustained and abnormal activation of the immune response results in oxidative stress of the digestive tract and in a loss of intestinal homeostasis. We previously reported that heterologous production of the Lactobacillus plantarum manganese catalase (MnKat) enhances the survival of Lb. casei BL23 when exposed to oxidative stress. Anti-inflammatory effects were observed after Lb. casei BL23 oral administrations in moderate murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, without added effects of the MnKat production. Here, we evaluated the protective effects obtained by an improved antioxidative strategy. The Lactococcus lactis sodA gene was expressed in Lb. casei BL23 which acquired an efficient manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity. The effects of Lb. casei MnSOD alone or in combination with Lb. casei MnKat were compared first in eukaryotic cell PMA-induced oxidative stress model and then in severe murine DSS-induced colitis. Based on ROS production assays as well as colonic histological scores, a significant reduction of both oxidative stress and inflammation was observed with Lb. casei MnSOD either alone or in combination with Lb. casei MnKat. No added effect of the presence of Lb. casei MnKat was observed. These results suggest that Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD could have anti-inflammatory effects on gut inflammation.
TI  - Decrease in frequency of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients given the multispecies probiotic VSL#3: a pilot trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea has adverse consequences for critically ill patients, health care staff, and health care costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the multispecies probiotic VSL#3 in reducing the mean number of episodes of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients. METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was done in a 6-bed intensive care unit in a 330-bed public hospital in Australia. A total of 45 adults (20 intervention, 25 control) who required enteral nutrition for more than 72 hours were given VSL#3 or a placebo twice daily. The frequency (mean number of episodes per patient per day) and weight (grams per day) were determined for both liquid stool and liquid and loose (unformed) stool. RESULTS: The 2 groups of patients had no demographic or clinical differences. Patients received enteral nutrition for a mean of 8.5 days (SD, 5.4) and were studied for a mean of 11.9 days (SD, 5.6). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significant reduction in the frequency of liquid stools (incidence rate ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.93; P = .03). Smaller but still significant differences also occurred between the groups in both the frequency of episodes and the weight of liquid and loose (unformed) stool. CONCLUSION: VSL#3 was effective in reducing the frequency of liquid stool in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. Probiotics possibly can minimize diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed patients, but more controlled clinical trials are needed.
TI  - Microbiological studies of ethnic meat products of the Eastern Himalayas.
AB  - Native microorganisms from some ethnic meat products of the Eastern Himalayas such as lang kargyong, yak kargyong, faak kargyong, lang satchu, yak satchu and suka ko masu were isolated and characterized. The bacterial isolates included Lactobacillus sake, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus divergens, Lactobacillus carnis, Lactobacillus sanfrancisco, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceous, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus lentus and Bacillus licheniformis, Micrococcus and Staphylococcus. Yeast isolates included Debaryomyces hansenii, Debaryomyces polymorphus, Debaryomyces pseudopolymorphus, Pichia burtonii, Pichia anomala, Candida famata and the mould Rhizopus was also identified. Many of the LAB isolates demonstrated some antimicrobial activity, enzymatic activity and a few showed a high degree of hydrophobicity. None of the strains produced biogenic amines.
TI  - Influence of microfiltration and adjunct culture on quality of Domiati cheese.
AB  - The effects of microfiltration and pasteurization processes on proteolysis, lipolysis, and flavor development in Domiati cheese during 2 mo of pickling were studied. Cultures of starter lactic acid bacteria isolated from Egyptian dairy products were evaluated in experimental Domiati cheese for flavor development capabilities. In the first trial, raw skim milk was microfiltered and then the protein:fat ratio was standardized using pasteurized cream. Pasteurized milk with same protein:fat ratio was also used in the second trial. The chemical composition of cheeses seemed to be affected by milk treatment-microfiltration or pasteurization-rather than by the culture types. The moisture content was higher and the pH was lower in pasteurized milk cheeses than in microfiltered milk cheeses at d 1 of manufacture. Chemical composition of experimental cheeses was within the legal limits for Domiati cheese in Egypt. Proteolysis and lipolysis during cheese pickling were lower in microfiltered milk cheeses compared with pasteurized milk cheeses. Highly significant variations in free amino acids, free fatty acids, and sensory evaluation were found among the cultures used in Domiati cheesemaking. The cheese made using adjunct culture containing Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Enterococcus faecium received high scores in flavor acceptability. Cheeses made from microfiltered milk received a higher score in body and texture compared with cheeses made from pasteurized milk.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of automated ribotyping and RAPD-PCR for typing of Lactobacillus spp. occurring in dental caries.
AB  - A group of 67 Lactobacillus spp. strains containing Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus salivarius species isolated from early childhood caries and identified to the species level in a previous study (Svec et al., Folia Microbiol 54:53-58, 2009) was characterized by automated ribotyping performed by the RiboPrinter microbial characterization system and by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting (RAPD-PCR) with M13 primer to evaluate these techniques for characterization of lactobacilli associated with dental caries. Ribotyping revealed 55 riboprints among the analysed group. The automatic identification process performed by the RiboPrinter system identified 18 strains to the species level, however cluster analysis divided obtained ribotype patterns into individual clusters mostly corresponding to the species assignment of particular strains. RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed by the individual Lactobacillus spp. showed higher variability than the ribotype patterns and the fingerprint profiles generated by the analysed species were distributed among one to four clusters. In conclusion, ribotyping is shown to be more convenient for the identification purposes while RAPD-PCR fingerprinting results indicate this method is a better tool for typing of Lactobacillus spp. strains occurring in dental caries.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional cachaca fermentations.
AB  - During the production of traditional cachaca (alembic s cachaca), contamination of the fermented must is one of the factors leading to economic losses in the beverage manufacturing industry. The diversity of bacterial populations and the role of these microorganisms during the cachaca production process are still poorly understood in Brazil. In our work, the fermentation process was followed in two distilleries located in the state of Minas Gerais. The objective of this work was to identify the populations of lactic acid bacteria present during cachaca fermentation using physiological and molecular methods. Lactic acid bacteria were isolated in high frequencies during all of the fermentative processes, and Lactobacillus plantarum and L. casei were the most prevalent species. Other lactic acid bacteria were found in minor frequencies, such as L. ferintoshensis, L. fermentum, L. jensenii, L. murinus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus sp. and Weissella confusa. These bacteria could contribute to the increase of volatile acidity levels or to the production of compounds that could influence the taste and aroma of the beverage.
TI  - Probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  - This study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. Bella di Cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) NaCl) at room temperature and 4 degrees C. The probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural LAB population and decreasing the pH of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. The dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host Enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. Yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 CFU/g) throughout the process. A considerable genetic diversity of LAB species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% NaCl, as indicated by the Shannon diversity index calculated for each set. Generally, strains of Lactobacillus coryniformis, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, L. pentosus, L. rhamnosus, L. brevis, L. mali, L. vaccinostercus, L.casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuc. pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Weissella paramesenteroides, W. cibaria, Enterococcus casseliflavus group and E. italicus were identified during the whole process. In particular, L. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees C. Also a notable incidence of Leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. Results indicated that the human strain L. paracasei IMPC2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.
TI  - Intestinal Lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  - The higher counts or particular groups (Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. We further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. The questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (BDC-LDL) of blood sera were explored. The PCR-based intestinal Lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (LAB) were tested. The facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. The number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). In elderly consuming probiotics the LAB counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (OR=1.71, CI95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (BMI). The colonization by L. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to L. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (OR=0.16, CI95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). However, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with Lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for BMI (Adj. R(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. The higher white blood cells (WBC) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of Lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and BMI (Adj. R(2)=0.193, p=0.027). The lower values of ox-LDL were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and BMI (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; Adj. R(2)=0.184 p=0.029). In conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with WBC count, blood glucose and content of ox-LDL which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
TI  - Bacterial teichoic acids reverse predominant IL-12 production induced by certain  lactobacillus strains into predominant IL-10 production via TLR2-dependent ERK activation in macrophages.
AB  - The cytokine response of macrophages to probiotic lactobacilli varies between strains, and the balance of IL-10/IL-12 production is crucial for determination of the direction of the immune response. To clarify the mechanism whereby Lactobacillus strains differentially induce production of IL-10 and IL-12, we examined the potential relationship between cytokine production and MAPK activation. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, Lactobacillus plantarum potently induced IL-10 but weakly induced IL-12 production, whereas L. casei potently induced IL-12 but weakly induced IL-10 production. Kinetic analysis of the activation of ERK, p38, and JNK showed that L. plantarum induced a more rapid and intense activation of MAPKs, especially of ERK, than L. casei. A selective blockade of ERK activation induced by L. plantarum resulted in a decrease in IL-10 production and a simultaneous increase in IL-12 production. Interestingly, when macrophages were stimulated with a combination of L. plantarum and L. casei, IL-10 production was induced synergistically. We identified cell wall teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid as key factors for triggering the synergistic induction of IL-10 production, although these teichoic acids alone only weakly induced IL-10 production. The effect of these teichoic acids on IL-10 production was mediated by TLR2-dependent ERK activation. Our data demonstrate that activation of the ERK pathway is critical for determination of the balance of the IL-10/IL-12 response of macrophages to lactobacilli and that predominant IL-12 production induced by certain lactobacilli such as L. casei can be converted into predominant IL-10 production when stimulated in the presence of teichoic acids.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - [Biodiversity of Lactobacilli from fermented milk products in Northern Tibet].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to study the biodiversity of Lactobacilli from Northern Tibet in China, we developed enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) technique. METHODS: Seventy seven Lactobacillus strains were isolated from traditional fermented milk products which are made by herd man families in Northern Tibet of China. By ERIC-PCR technique method, using NTSYS-pc2.1 software, we investigated the biodiversity of the strains. RESULTS: The amplified bands of ERIC-PCR were clear and stable with high repetition and high polymorphisms. The cluster analysis showed that at level 0.73, 77 tested strains were clustered into 4 groups: A1: strains of Lactobacillus casei (35.06% of the strains), A2: strains of Lactobacillus fermentum (61.04% of the strains), A3: strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and A4: strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. The biodiversity of the isolates from Aland A2 groups was further investigated. A1 could be divided into 5 genotypes at the similarity of 80.0%. A2 could be divided into 6 genotypes at the similarity of 84.0%. CONCLUSION: Using ERIC-PCR technique, Lactobacilli from Northern Tibet could be distinguished at species level.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  - This study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models of non tumor origin. To this end, LAB strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (RV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) release as well as the attachment ability of LAB on the cell lines was investigated. Various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral RV or TGEV disruption. Highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota against both RV and TGEV, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to Enterococcus faecium PCK38, Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC179, Lactobacillus pentosus PCA227 and Lactobacillus plantarum PCA236 and PCS22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. A variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of NO(-) and H(2)O(2) (ROS) was obtained when LAB strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be LAB strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ROS release in more than one cell line. In contrast, the ability of the examined LAB strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was LAB strain but not cell line specific. Highest attachment ability was observed with L. plantarum ACA-DC 146, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans ACA-DC 4037 and E. faecium PCD71. Clear indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the L. casei Shirota against TGEV and with L. plantarum PCA236 against both RV and TGEV. In the rest of the cases, each interaction was LAB-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. However, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. Further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.
TI  - Probiotics: multifarious oral vaccine against infectious traumas.
AB  - Microorganisms have been used for a long time in food and alcoholic fermentation. In the last few years they have undergone scientific scrutiny of their preventative and therapeutic aspects. This has led to the discovery of a new term, probiotics. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are microbial communities normally present in the intestine of most animals. They play an important role in humans and other animals, and act as immunomodulators. They are helpful in the treatment and prevention of disease as well as improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Probiotic microorganisms include the LAB Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Use of these live bacteria to elicit an immune response or to carry a vaccine component is a new invention in vaccine development. The advantage of live bacterial vaccines is that they mimic natural infection, have intrinsic adjuvant properties and can be given orally. Components of pathogenic and nonpathogenic food-related microorganisms are currently being evaluated as candidates for oral vaccines.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid pD403 from Lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid pD403 was isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum D403 derived from fermented dairy products. It was 2,791 bp in size with a G+C content of 37%. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. ORF1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (RepA). ORF2 (137 amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of Ralstonia pickettii 12D. Functional investigation indicated that ORF2 (Tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. The origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pD403 was a rolling-circle-replication (RCR) plasmid. An Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vector pCD4032 was constructed based on the pD403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus brevis. The transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram DNA. Furthermore, an expression vector pCD4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. The green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pCD4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - An in vitro study on bacterial growth interactions and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion characteristics of probiotic combinations.
AB  - The aims of this study were to examine long-term growth interactions of five probiotic strains (Lactobacillus casei 01, Lactobacillus plantarum HA8, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12) either alone or in combination with Propionibacterium jensenii 702 in a co-culture system and to determine their adhesion ability to human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2. Growth patterns of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were not considerably affected by the presence of P. jensenii 702, whereas lactobacilli exerted a strong antagonistic action against P. jensenii 702. In the co-culture of Bif. lactis Bb12 and P. jensenii 702, a significant synergistic influence on growth of both bacteria was observed (P < 0.05). The results of adhesion assay showed that when probiotic strains were tested in combination, there was evidence of an associated effect on percentage adherence. However, in most cases these differences were not statistically significant (P < 0.05). Adhesion percentage of Lb. casei 01 and Lb. rhamnosus GG both decreased significantly in the presence of P. jensenii 702 compared to their adhesion levels when alone (P < 0.05). These results show that the survival and percentage adhesion of some probiotic strains may be influenced by the presence of other strains and this should be considered when formulating in the probiotic products.
TI  - The presence of prtP proteinase gene in natural isolate Lactobacillus plantarum BGSJ3-18.
AB  - AIMS: The study of proteolytic activity and examination of proteinase gene region organization in proteolytically active Lactobacillus plantarum strains from different natural sources. METHODS AND RESULTS: A set of 37 lactobacilli was distinguished by using multiplex PCR assay. Results showed that 34 strains were Lact. plantarum and three of them were Lact. paraplantarum. The examination of proteolytic activity revealed that 28 Lact. plantarum and two Lact. paraplantarum hydrolyse beta-casein. Further analyses of all proteolytically active Lact. plantarum with primers specific for different types of CEPs demonstrated that strain BGSJ3-18 has prtP catalytic domain as well as prtP-prtM intergenic region showing more than 95% sequence identity with the same regions present in Lact. paracasei, Lact. casei and L. lactis. No presence of prtB, prtH or prtR proteinase genes was detected in any of tested Lact. plantarum strains. CONCLUSIONS: One out of 28 analysed Lact. plantarum strains harbours the prtP-like gene. The other proteolytically active Lact. plantarum probably possesses a different type of extracellular proteinase(s). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is the first report about the presence of the prtP-like gene in Lact. plantarum, which illustrates the mobility of this gene and its presence in different species.
TI  - Gut health promoting activity of new putative probiotic/protective Lactobacillus  spp. strains: a functional study in the small intestinal cell model.
AB  - In interaction studies with the host intestine, the use of the appropriate gut functional cell model is essential. Therefore, we examined the protective properties of selected lactobacilli in a newly established intestinal cell model. Bacteria were cocultured with the pig small intestinal epithelial cells (PSIc1) and pig blood monocytes (PoM2) in a functional intestinal cell model. Intercellular intestinal integrity was measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), before and after coculture with selected bacterial strains. All selected bacterial strains showed important gut health promoting activity by: enhancing the intestinal integrity and increasing metabolic activity of intestinal cells. Stimulation of immune response was strain specific. The best stimulants were unidentified lactobacillus strains obtained from fermented food in Africa (PCK87 and 66), followed by Lactobacillus plantarum (PCS26). Their activity was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of the commercial Lactobacillus casei Shirota strain.
TI  - Peptidoglycan from lactobacilli inhibits interleukin-12 production by macrophages induced by Lactobacillus casei through Toll-like receptor 2-dependent and independent mechanisms.
AB  - We previously showed that Lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion can stimulate macrophages to induce large a quantity of interleukin-12 (IL-12). In this study, we examined the influence of lactobacilli and bacterial cell wall components on IL-12 production by macrophages that was induced by Lactobacillus casei, which has a rigid cell wall. Easily digestible lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus plantarum or their intact cell walls (ICWs) weakly or very weakly induced IL-12 production by macrophages, and inhibitedL. casei-induced IL-12 production. While the ICW of L. casei was resistant to intracellular digestion and did not inhibit L. casei-induced IL-12 production, its polysaccharide-depleted ICW, i.e. intact peptidoglycan, was sensitive to intracellular digestion and inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Furthermore, the peptidoglycans of L. johnsonii, L. plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus also inhibited L. casei-induced IL-12 production. Peptidoglycans from lactobacilli suppressed L. casei-induced expression of IL-12p40 but not IL-12p35 mRNA. Inhibition of IL-12 production by peptidoglycan was mitigated in Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-deficient macrophages compared with the inhibition in wild-type macrophages. A derivative of the minimal structural unit of peptidoglycan (6-O-stearoyl-muramyl dipeptide) recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) could also suppress L. casei-induced IL-12 production. These findings demonstrate that easily digestible bacteria and peptidoglycan suppress IL-12 production through pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 and NOD2. IL-12 production in the gut may be negatively regulated by the simultaneous inhibitory actions of various resident bacteria that are susceptible to intracellular digestion.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Isolation and basic characterization of a beta-glucosidase from a strain of Lactobacillus brevis isolated from a malolactic starter culture.
AB  - AIMS: To study glycosidase activities of a Lactobacillus brevis strain and to isolate an intracellular beta-glucosidase from this strain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from a commercially available starter culture preparation for malolactic fermentation were tested for beta-glycosidase activities. A strain of Lact. brevis showing high intracellular beta-D-glucosidase, beta-D-xylosidase and alpha-L-arabinosidase activities was selected for purification and characterization of its beta-glucosidase. The pure glucosidase from Lact. brevis has also side activities of xylosidase, arabinosidase and cellobiosidase. It is a homotetramer of 330 kDa and has an isoelectric point at pH 3.5. The K(m) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside is 0.22 and 1.14 mmol l(-1), respectively. The beta-glucosidase activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid delta-lactone, partially by glucose and gluconate, but not by fructose. Ethanol and methanol were found to increase the activity up to twofold. The free enzyme was stable at pH 7.0 (t(1/2) = 50 day) but not at pH 4.0 (t(1/2) = 4 days). CONCLUSIONS: The beta-glucosidase from Lact. brevis is widely different to that characterized from Lactobacillus casei (Coulon et al. 1998) and Lactobacillus plantarum (Sestelo et al. 2004). The high tolerance to fructose and ethanol, the low inhibitory effect of glucose on the enzyme activity and the good long-term stability could be of great interest for the release of aroma compounds during winemaking. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although the release of aroma compounds by LAB has been demonstrated by several authors, little information exists on the responsible enzymes. This study contains the first characterization of an intracellular beta-glucosidase isolated from a wine-related strain of Lact. brevis.
TI  - Production of exopolysaccharides by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  - This work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in milk. The strains belong to the species Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The molar mass distribution of EPS fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some EPS from bacteria of food origin. In general, we detected an association between the EPS size distribution and the EPS-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial EPS tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. The main monosaccharide components of the EPS under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the galactose ratio in our human bacterial EPS. All EPS-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the EPS-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. With respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, L. plantarum H2 and L. rhamnosus E41 and E43R were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive control. Therefore, these human EPS-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. This is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of EPS isolated from human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Functional analysis of the plasmid pM4 replicon from Lactobacillus plantarum M4:  determination of the minimal replicon and functionality identification of the putative sso.
AB  - In order to determine the minimal replicon and the single strand origin (sso) of  the plasmid pM4, different fragments of pM4 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pBEm, a replication probe vector for Lactobacillus. The deletion analysis results showed that the minimal replicon of pM4 could be determined within a 1280bp fragment consisting of double strand origin (dso) and rep gene encoding replication protein. Based on plasmid segregation stability assay and its ability to convert single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by Southern hybridization, an sso of replication was located at nucleotides -118-92 in the plasmid pM4, about 300bp upstream of dso. In addition, the host range assay indicated that plasmid pM4 could replicate in L. casei 05-21, L. rhamnosus AS 1.2466(T) and L. plantarum 05-19 of all the tested Lactobacillus strains. Analysis of the pM4 replicon will allow its use in constructing a food-grade vector for application in food industry.
TI  - Culture-based PCR analysis of plaque samples of Japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from Cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of Japanese elementary school children through PCR analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of Cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. This epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 Japanese elementary school children. Assessed using the Cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. DNA detection of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and both S. mutans and S. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. Except for S. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. Caries risk assessed using Cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. Being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the Cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial DNA for PCR analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.
TI  - Fermented goats' milk produced with selected multiple starters as a potentially functional food.
AB  - A screening among five lactic acid bacteria, used alone or in combination, led to select a mixed starter (Streptococcus thermophilus CR12, Lactobacillus casei LC01, Lactobacillus helveticus PR4, Lactobacillus plantarum 1288) capable to produce a fermented goats' milk containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. The fermented milk was characterized by cell counts of lactic acid bacteria not lower than 7.0 log cfu g(-1), even after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Fermentation of goats' milk resulted in the production of ca. 28 mg kg(-1) of GABA. Furthermore the fermented goats' milk had an in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity of ca. 73%. Prolonged cold storage did not significantly affect both the concentration of GABA and the ACE-inhibitory activity. Moreover, the taurine content did not significantly vary during both fermentation and the entire storage period.
TI  - Probiotic potential of noni juice fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - The present study assesses the feasibility of noni as a raw substrate for the production of probiotic noni juice by lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacilluscasei and Lactobacillus plantarum) and bifidobacteria (Bifidobacteriumlongum). Changes in pH, acidity, sugar content, cell survival and antioxidant properties during fermentation were monitored. All tested strains grew well on noni juice, reaching nearly 10(9) colony-forming units/ml after 48 h fermentation. L.casei produced less lactic acid than B.longum and L. plantarum. After 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees C, B.longum and L. plantarum survived under low-pH conditions in fermented noni juice. In contrast, L.casei exhibited no cell viability after 3 weeks. Moreover, noni juice fermented with B.longum had a high antioxidant capacity that did not differ significantly (P <0.05) from that of lactic acid bacteria. Finally, we found that B.longum and L. plantarum are optimal probiotics for fermentation with noni juice.
TI  - Lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  - A group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ECC) affected children treated in the Department of Pedodontics (Children's Teaching Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic). Biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by API 50 CH kit and conventional tube tests. The rep-PCR fingerprinting with the (GTG)(5) primer was used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. The (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. In total, 20 strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, 17 L. rhamnosus, 14 L. casei/paracasei, 7 L. gasseri, 7 L. salivarius and 4 L. plantarum were identified. Mixtures of two or even three Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. Results obtained by biotyping and (GTG)(5)-PCR were generally comparable except for L. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. The (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. Our results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of Lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.
TI  - Bacteriophages of lactobacillus.
AB  - In this review, we are listing Lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. Putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. Our literature searches led to the identification of 231 Lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the Siphoviridae family, 76 to the Myoviridae family, and 1 to the Podoviridae family. Model phages infecting Lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of Lactobacillus hosts. To date, nine complete Lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. Features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. Lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. Because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on Lactobacillus phages is bright.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of REP3123 against Clostridium difficile and other  anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the anaerobic spectrum of activity of REP3123, a novel diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl-tRNA synthetases in Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Fifty recent clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile from patients diagnosed with C. difficile infection and 223 other intestinal normal flora anaerobes were tested for their susceptibility to REP3123 and four or five comparator agents by the agar dilution method using supplemented Brucella agar with 5% laked sheep blood. RESULTS: All strains of C. difficile were inhibited by 0.5-1 mg/L REP3123, including those resistant to moxifloxacin and clindamycin. REP3123 lacked activity against many normal flora anaerobes in the gut, including Clostridium ramosum, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli of the Lactobacillus casei-rhamnosus-plantarum group and Gram-negative anaerobes. CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 demonstrated good potency against C. difficile, but limited activity against many other intestinal anaerobic species, thus, in theory, maintaining the colonization resistance barrier.
TI  - Isolation and preliminary probiotic selection of lactobacilli from koumiss in Inner Mongolia.
AB  - From 16 samples of traditional fermented koumiss collected in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, forty-eight lactobacilli strains were isolated and phenotypically characterized by their abilities to ferment different carbohydrates and by additional biochemical tests. The dominant lactobacilli species were identified as L. casei (17 strains), L. helveticus (10 strains) and L. plantarum (8 strains), with a lower frequency of isolation for L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis (5 strains), L. paracasei (3 strains), L. kefiranofaciens (2 strains), L. curvatus (1 strain), L. fermentum (1 strain) and W. kandleri (1 strain). The pH values of all these samples were ranging from 3.37 to 3.94. In isolates, L. casei Zhang, L. helveticus ZL12-1, and L. plantarum BX6-6 were selected as potentially probiotic strains through the preliminary tests including resistance to low acid, abilities to grow in MRS with bile salts, antimicrobial activities and the viabilities during prolonged cold storage in fermented milk. Moreover 16S rDNA was conducted to confirm the identification.
TI  - Aflatoxin B1 binding capacity of autochthonous strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Some foods are prone to contamination with aflatoxins, with detrimental effect on human health. Lactic acid bacteria have been reported to bind aflatoxins and remove them from foods and feeds. Reduction of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) from the liquid media by the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus fermentum) isolated from traditional Iranian sourdough and dairy products is reported in the current study. The effect of incubation time on the binding capacity of the strains to AFB1 was also investigated. Duplicates of individual bacteria with population equivalent to 2 X 10(10) CFU/ml were incubated in the presence of AFB1 at 37 degrees C for a period of 72 h, and the amounts of unbound AFB1 were quantitated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. All the strains were capable of removal of AFB1, and the reduction of AFB1 ranged from 25 to 61% throughout the incubation period. Removal of AFB1 was a rapid process, with approximately 61 and 56% of the toxin taken instantly by L. fermentum and L. plantarum, respectively. Binding was of a reversible nature, and some of the bound AFB1 was released into the media by the repeated centrifugation and resuspension of the cell pellets. The stability of the bacteria-toxin complex was strain dependent, and L. casei was a stronger binder of AFB1 compared with the other bacteria. No toxin release was observed after 24 h. These findings tend to suggest that certain novel probiotic bacteria with high aflatoxin binding capacity could be selected for detoxification of foods.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Bulgarian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. METHOD AND RESULTS: Seven LAB strains [Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (PC5), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (BB18), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (BCM5, BK15), Enterococcus faecium (MH3), Lactobacillus plantarum (BR12), Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (BCZ2)], isolated from authentic Bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. The bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees C for 15 min, stable at pH 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. Two of bacteriocins produced by Lact. bulgaricus BB18 (bulgaricin BB18) and E. faecium MH3 (enterocin MH3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin BB18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus bulgaricus BB18 and E. faecium MH3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. Furthermore, bulgaricin BB18 strongly inhibits Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  - Some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. However, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. The pH fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. All strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. Six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in pH with sorbitol and two with xylitol. None of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. As all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for oral health purposes can be made.
TI  - Selection of probiotic lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented plant beverages.
AB  - Screening for probiotic bacteria from non-human sources were performed in this study. Three hundred and twenty-seven strains of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) were isolated from 90 samples of Fermented Plant Beverages (FPBs) and pickles collected from around Thailand. Potentially useful probiotic properties were investigated in vitro in parallel with a commercial probiotic strain of Lactobacillus casei, R obtained from a dairy probiotic product in Thailand. An isolate SS2, selected from a fermented star fruit beverage, survived in the human biological barriers (0.15 and 0.30% bile salt, pH values between 3-8, presence or absence of oxygen), resistance to some antibiotics in general use and showed other benefits to the host (antibacterial activity, utilizations of protein and starch). The isolate SS2 had a higher specific growth rate and better inhibitory properties against food borne pathogenic bacteria and spoilage organisms than the commercial probiotic R strain. It also grew well in MRS and the SPY2 medium that is free from animal-derived ingredients, (r>0.8). The isolate SS2 was therefore considered to be a potentially useful probiotic LAB for a non dairy product such as FPBs and was provisionally identified as a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum.
TI  - Adhesion of the probiotic strains Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA and Lactobacillus plantarum 423 to Caco-2 cells under conditions simulating the intestinal tract, and in the presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments.
AB  - Adhesion of Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA and Lactobacillus plantarum 423 to Caco-2  (human carcinoma epithelial) cells was visualized by fluorescent staining. Both strains showed good adhesion compared to L. casei MB1, L. casei Shirota, L. johnsonii La1 and L. rhamnosus GG. No correlation was found between hydrophobicity, aggregation and adhesion to Caco-2 cells. Presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments reduced adhesion of bacterial strains to Caco-2 cells. Proteins sensitive to pepsin, trypsin and pronase are involved in the adhesion of E. mundtii ST4SA and L. plantarum 423 to Caco-2 cells. Adhesion of Listeria monocytogenes ScottA to Caco-2 cells was not prevented by E. mundtii ST4SA and L. plantarum 423. Cell-free culture supernatants of strains ST4SA and 423, containing the antimicrobial peptides plantaricin 423 and peptide ST4SA, prevented the invasion of L. monocytogenes ScottA into Caco-2 cells.
TI  - Early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  - Following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. We hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and NEC. Caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (COLOS; n = 5), formula (FORM; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (FORM-P; Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus: L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum; n = 13). Clinical NEC scores were reduced (P < 0.05) in FORM-P (2.0 +/- 0.2) and COLOS groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with FORM pigs (3.4 +/- 0.6). Lower NEC scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, RNA integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase A and N activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the FORM-P and COLOS groups (P < 0.05). Diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between FORM-P and FORM pigs. FORM-P pigs had lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, Clostridium perfringens, and had commensal Lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to FORM pigs. These results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of NEC.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plca36 isolated from Lactobacillus casei  Zhang.
AB  - The complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from Lactobacillus casei Zhang  was determined. Plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. For the first time, we identified a relBE toxin-antitoxin (TA) locus in a Lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. A region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. The cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pWCFS103 and pMRC01 from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. Comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus Lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. In addition, two chromosome-encoded relBE systems in Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus gasseri were identified.
TI  - [Indication and identification of Lactobacillus spp. with the use of polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - AIM: The aim of the work is the development of laboratory test for indication and identification of Lactobacillus spp. by the polymerase chain reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The work is developed on the base of the GenBank/EMBL data about genetic sequences of the Lactobacillus spp. The sequences of DNA were studied with the help of the ClustalW program. The strains of the Lactobacillus spp., which are the object of the research, have been registered in Russian collection of industrial microorganisms. RESULTS: The laboratory test of nested-PCR for indication and identification L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus was performed. The specificity of the nested-PCR was correlated with the control analyses of monoculture Lactobacillus spp. and commercial products. CONCLUSION: The new developed laboratory nested-PCR test may be use in control system of milk foods enriched by probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. Recent studies indicated that some Lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. However, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. Therefore, we examined the effects of Lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (Cl(-)/OH(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells. Postconfluent Caco-2 cells were treated with the Lactobacillus species Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, or Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)Cl uptake in base-loaded cells. Treatment with live, but not heat-killed, LA and LR significantly increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. Similarly, the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live LA increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange. The ability of LA or its conditioned culture medium to enhance Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity was blocked by PI-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Corresponding to the increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity, LA treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, SLC26A3 [Down Regulated in Adenoma (DRA)]. The increased DRA membrane localization might contribute to the increased Cl(-) absorption by LA. Our results suggest that LA secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.
TI  - Administration of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum affects the diversity of murine intestinal lactobacilli, but not the overall bacterial community structure.
AB  - Lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of many mammalian hosts. Their administration as probiotics in functional foods is currently a frequent practice, mainly because of their benefits to host health. It is therefore of interest to study the impact of administration of exogenous strains of Lactobacillus normally used as probiotics upon endogenous microbial populations. For this purpose, fecal and intestinal tissue samples were analyzed in a mouse model fed with a mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei isolated from commercially available dairy products. The murine intestinal microbiota was studied by means of cultivation-independent 16S rRNA gene-targeted techniques, namely denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and sequence analysis of clone libraries. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to integrate datasets obtained from the different techniques applied. Whereas no differences were detected in the composition of the overall fecal bacterial community, changes were observed for intestinal tissue samples. Moreover, an increase in the diversity of gut lactobacilli was observed in fecal as well as intestinal tissue samples when mice received the mixture of L. casei and L. plantarum.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. LAB mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. Two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five ATCC reference Lactobacillus strains. Thirty six isolates showed activity in the agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. However, only six cell free supernatants (CFS) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. L. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas L. plantarum and L. fermentum were the most resistant ones. Identification by MIDI system indicated that these LAB isolates were Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus casei GC subgroup A. The antagonistic factors produced by most of these LAB against L. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees C for 10 min) and stable over a wide pH range (4.0 to 9.0). These data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.
TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.
TI  - Microbial dynamics of Castelmagno PDO, a traditional Italian cheese, with a focus on lactic acid bacteria ecology.
AB  - The dynamics of dominant microflora throughout the manufacture and ripening processes were evaluated in three batches of traditional Castelmagno PDO cheese. Milk, curd and cheese samples, at different stages during cheesemaking, were collected and subjected to culture-dependent and -independent analysis. Traditional plating and genetic identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates, and PCR-DGGE analysis of V1 region of 16S rRNA gene were carried out. The collected samples were also monitored by HPLC for the presence of organic acids, sugars and ketones. LAB resulted to be the prevailing microflora in all production stages although enterococci, coagulase-negative cocci and yeasts also showed considerable viable counts probably related to the presence, in the dairy samples analysed, of free short-chain fatty acids detected by HPLC. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the species most frequently isolated during Castelmagno PDO manufacture, while Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paracasei were isolated with the highest frequencies from ripened Castelmagno PDO cheese samples. Occasionally strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens and Lactobacillus casei were isolated. The results obtained on Castelmagno PDO microflora underlines a partial correspondence between culture-dependent method and DGGE analysis. Thus, in this study, it is highlighted once more the importance to combine molecular culture-independent approaches with classical microbiological methods for the study of complex environmental communities occurring in food matrices.
TI  - Influence of selected lab cultures on the evolution of free amino acids, free fatty acids and Fiore Sardo cheese microflora during the ripening.
AB  - Fiore Sardo Protected Denomination of Origin is a traditional Sardinian (Italy) hard cheese produced exclusively from whole raw ovine milk and coagulated with lamb rennet paste. Currently, Fiore Sardo is still produced by shepherds at the farmhouse level without the addition of any starter culture and the cheese-making process is characterized by significant waste. The first objective of the present work was to investigate the autochthonous microflora present in milk and Fiore Sardo cheese in order to select lactic acid bacterial (LAB) cultures with suitable cheese-making attributes and, possibly reduce the production waste. Secondly, the ability of selected cultures to guarantee cheese healthiness and quality was tested in experimental cheese-making trials. In this study, we show that the typical lactic microflora of raw ewe's milk and Fiore Sardo cheese is mostly composed of mesophilic LAB such as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei. Moreover, strains belonging to the species were selected for cheese-making attributes and used in experimental cheese-making trials carried out in different farms producing Fiore Sardo. The evolution of the cheese microflora, free amino acids and free fatty acids during the ripening showed that the experimental cheeses were characterized by a balanced ratio of the chemical constituents, by a reduced number of spoilage microorganisms and, remarkably, by the absence of production waste that were significant for the control cheeses.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. There is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as Lactobacillus. The hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains are effected by PPIs. METHODS: Nineteen different strains of Lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at pH of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/mL to 2.5 microg/mL. Bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to pantoprazole. RESULTS: In the unexposed (control) group, nine Lactobacilli strains were affected by pH changes from 6.5 to 4.5. In the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 Lactobacilli strains were found to have an MIC below 625 microg/mL, with L. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (MIC = 20 microg/mL). In some strains, such as L. s. salivarius 11741, Gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. CONCLUSION: Growth rates and morphology of oral Lactobacillus are affected by the pH of the environment. Pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. SIGNIFICANCE: The balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of PPI pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.
TI  - System using tandem repeats of the cA peptidoglycan-binding domain from Lactococcus lactis for display of both N- and C-terminal fusions on cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the C terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (cA domain) of AcmA (a major autolysin from Lactococcus lactis). Western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (cA-AmyA) of the cA domain and alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 (AmyA) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of L. lactis cells. AmyA was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. Moreover, with an increase in the number of cA domains, the quantity of cA-AmyA fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. When three repeats of the cA domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. The raw starch-degrading activity of AmyA was significantly higher when AmyA was fused to the C terminus of the cA domain than when it was fused to the N terminus. In addition, cA-AmyA fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Fermentation of calcium-fortified soymilk with Lactobacillus: effects on calcium  solubility, isoflavone conversion, and production of organic acids.
AB  - The objective of this study was to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of Lactobacillus, namely, L. acidophilus ATCC 4962, ATCC33200, ATCC 4356, ATCC 4461, L. casei ASCC 290, L. plantarum ASCC 276, and L. fermentum VRI-003. The parameters that were used are viability, pH, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. Calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C, then stored for 14 d at 4 degrees C. Soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA). Organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using HPLC. Viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8.5 log(10) CFU/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14-d storage at 4 degrees C. After 24 h, there was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in soluble calcium. L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 and L. casei ASCC 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89.3% and 87.0% soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. The increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered pH associated with production of lactic and acetic acids. Fermentation significantly increased (P < 0.05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. Our results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment.
TI  - Lactobacillus strain diversity based on partial hsp60 gene sequences and design of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays for species identification and differentiation.
AB  - A phylogenetic tree showing diversities among 116 partial (499-bp) Lactobacillus  hsp60 (groEL, encoding a 60-kDa heat shock protein) nucleotide sequences was obtained and compared to those previously described for 16S rRNA and tuf gene sequences. The topology of the tree produced in this study showed a Lactobacillus species distribution similar, but not identical, to those previously reported. However, according to the most recent systematic studies, a clear differentiation of 43 single-species clusters was detected/identified among the sequences analyzed. The slightly higher variability of the hsp60 nucleotide sequences than of the 16S rRNA sequences offers better opportunities to design or develop molecular assays allowing identification and differentiation of either distant or very closely related Lactobacillus species. Therefore, our results suggest that hsp60 can be considered an excellent molecular marker for inferring the taxonomy and phylogeny of members of the genus Lactobacillus and that the chosen primers can be used in a simple PCR procedure allowing the direct sequencing of the hsp60 fragments. Moreover, in this study we performed a computer-aided restriction endonuclease analysis of all 499-bp hsp60 partial sequences and we showed that the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns obtainable by using both endonucleases AluI and TacI (in separate reactions) can allow identification and differentiation of all 43 Lactobacillus species considered, with the exception of the pair L. plantarum/L. pentosus. However, the latter species can be differentiated by further analysis with Sau3AI or MseI. The hsp60 PCR-RFLP approach was efficiently applied to identify and to differentiate a total of 110 wild Lactobacillus strains (including closely related species, such as L. casei and L. rhamnosus or L. plantarum and L. pentosus) isolated from cheese and dry-fermented sausages.
TI  - Characterisation of pSMA23, a 3.5 kbp plasmid of Lactobacillus casei, and application for heterologous expression in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pSMA23 isolated from Lactobacillus casei A23 was determined. Plasmid pSMA23 is a 3497bp circular molecule with a G+C content of 38.18%. Four putative open reading frames were identified. Based on homology, two orfs were identified as genes encoding replication initiation (Rep) and mobilisation (Mob) protein, respectively. Various regulatory regions like promoters, ribosome binding site (RBS), transcriptional terminators were deduced from the sequences of rep and mob. The origin of replication (dso) was predicted. Shuttle vectors pL142 and pL157 were constructed for Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus using rep gene and ori of pSMA23 for replication in Lactobacillus, the ori of the commercial vector pBluescript SkII+ for replication in E. coli, and the erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes of pE194 and pC194, respectively, as selection markers. Transformants of E. coli and Lactobacillus were obtained on media containing erythromycin and chloramphenicol, respectively, suggesting expression of the ermC and cat194 genes in both organisms. The shsp gene of plasmid pSt04 of Streptococcus thermophilus encoding a small heat shock protein and the Lactobacillus plantarum cbh gene encoding conjugated bile salts hydrolase were cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host Lb. casei LK1 with the aid of pSMA23-derived vectors.
TI  - Compositional, microbiological, biochemical, volatile profile and sensory characterization of four Italian semi-hard goats' cheeses.
AB  - Four semi-hard Italian goats' milk cheeses, Flor di Capra (FC), Caprino di Cavalese (CC), Caprino di Valsassina (CV) and Capritilla (C), were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, volatile profile and sensory characteristics. Mean values for the gross composition in part differed between cheeses. At the end of ripening, cheeses contained 7.98-8.51 log10 cfu/g of non-starter lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus paracasei, Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were dominant in almost all cheeses. As shown by the Principal Component Analysis of RP-FPLC data for the pH 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free amino acids, secondary proteolysis of CC and CV mainly differed from the other two cheeses. A total of 72 volatile components were identified by steam distillation-extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Free fatty acids and esters qualitatively and quantitatively differentiated the profile of CV and CC, respectively. The lowest concentrations of volatile components characterized FC. Descriptive sensory analysis using 17 flavour attributes was carried out by a trained panel. Different flavour attributes distinguished the four goats' cheeses and relationships were found with volatile components, biochemical characteristics and technology.
TI  - Nonstarter Lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  - Nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. In this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. The objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in vitro and in situ assays. Milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid 8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. In addition, the tolerance to salts (NaCl and KCl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. Four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. In in vitro assays, most strains acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. Fast strains decreased milk pH to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. This group consisted mostly of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. Approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. Peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. Most strains showed salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. The Lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. In both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming or equaling primary starter. Overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. The lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.
TI  - The Lactobacillus plantarum strain ACA-DC287 isolated from a Greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the Xynotyri cheese isolate Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. METHODS AND RESULTS: The co-culture of L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. The killing activity was produced mainly by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287. The culture of the L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 inhibited the penetration of S. typhimurium SL1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells. In conventional mice infected with S. typhimurium SL1344, the intake of L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 results in a decrease in the levels of Salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those present in the intestinal contents. In germ-free mice, the L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS: The L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 strain exerts anti-Salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei Shirota YIT9029 and Lactobacillus johnsonii La1. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The observation that a selected cheese Lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic Lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.
TI  - The role of a probiotics mixture in the treatment of childhood constipation: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inconsistent data exist about the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of constipation. Several studies in adults with constipation showed positive effects of probiotics on constipation. Inconsistent data exist regarding the effect of a single probiotic strain in constipated children. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effect of a mixture of probiotics containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the treatment of childhood constipation. METHODS: Children aged 4-16 years with constipation as defined by the Rome III criteria were eligible for the study. During a 4 week period, children received a daily mix of 4 x 109 colony forming units of a probiotic mixture (Ecologic(R)Relief) containing Bifidobacteria (B.) bifidum, B. infantis, B. longum, Lactobacilli (L.) casei, L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus. Primary outcome measures were frequency of bowel movements (BMs) per week and stool consistency. Secondary outcome measures were number of faecal incontinence episodes per week, abdominal pain and side effects. RESULTS: Twenty children, 50% male, median age 8 (range 4-16) were included. The frequency of BMs per week increased from 2.0 (1.0-5.0) to 4.2 (0.0-16.0) in week 2 (p = 0.10) and 3.8 (2.1-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.13). In 12 children presenting with <3 BMs/week, BMs per week increased significantly from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) to 3.0 (0.0-7.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 3.0 (0.0-10.0) in week 4 (p = 0.01). The stool consistency was reported as hard in 7 children at baseline, in 4 children at week 2 (p = 0.23) and in 6 children after 4 weeks of treatment (p = 1.00). A significant decrease in number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was found in the entire group: 4.0 (0.0-35.0) to 1.5 (0.0-14.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 0.3 (0.0-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.001). The presence of abdominal pain decreased significantly from 45% to 25% in week 2 (p = 0.04) and 20% at week 4 (p = 0.006). No side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that a mixture of probiotics, has positive effects on symptoms of constipation. To confirm these findings, a large randomised placebo controlled trial is required.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of Lactobacillus casei BL23 producing or not a manganese-dependant catalase on DSS-induced colitis in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human immune cells generate large amounts of reactive oxygen species  (ROS) throughout the respiratory burst that occurs during inflammation. In inflammatory bowel diseases, a sustained and abnormal activation of the immune system results in oxidative stress in the digestive tract and in a loss of intestinal homeostasis. We previously showed that the heterologous production of the Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC14431 manganese-dependant catalase (MnKat) in Lb. casei BL23 successfully enhances its survival when exposed to oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated the preventive effects of this antioxidative Lb. casei strain in a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced moderate colitis. RESULTS: Either Lb. casei BL23 MnKat- or MnKat+ was administered daily to mice treated with DSS for 10 days. In contrast to control mice treated with PBS for which DSS induced bleeding diarrhea and mucosal lesions, mice treated with both Lb. casei strains presented a significant (p < 0.05) reduction of caecal and colonic inflammatory scores. CONCLUSION: No contribution of MnKat to the protective effect from epithelial damage has been observed in the tested conditions. In contrast, these results confirm the high interest of Lb. casei as an anti-inflammatory probiotic strain.
TI  - Preliminary characterization of wild lactic acid bacteria and their abilities to  produce flavour compounds in ripened model cheese system.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to preliminary characterize wild lactic acid bacteria (LAB), previously isolated during artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheese-making for technological and flavour formation abilities in a model cheese system. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve LAB were studied for the ability to grow at 10 and 45 degrees C, to coagulate and acidify both reconstituted skim milk and ewe's milk. Moreover, the capacity of the strains to generate aroma compounds was evaluated in a model cheese system at 30- and 60-day ripening. Flavour compounds were screened by sensory analysis and throughout gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS). Most of the strains were able to grow both at 10 and 45 degrees C and exhibited high ability to acidify and coagulate ewes' milk. Sensory evaluation revealed that the wild strains produced more significant flavour attributes than commercial strains in the 60-day-old model cheese system. GC-MS data confirmed the results of sensory evaluations and showed the ability of wild lactobacilli to generate key volatile compounds. Particularly, three wild lactobacilli strains, belonging to Lactobacillus casei, Lb. rhamnosus and Lb. plantarum species, generated both in 60- and 30-day-old model cheeses system, the 3-methyl butan(al)(ol) compound, which is associated with fruity taste. CONCLUSIONS: The present work preliminarily demonstrated that the technological and flavour formation abilities of the wild strains are strain-specific and that wild lactobacilli, which produced key flavour compounds during ripening, could be used as tailor-made starters. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reports the technological characterization and flavour formation ability of wild LAB strains isolated from artisanal Pecorino cheese and highlights that the catabolic activities were highly strain dependent. Hence, wild lactobacilli could be selected as tailor-made starter cultures for the PS cheese manufacture.
TI  - Evidence for in vitro anti-genotoxicity of cheese non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  - The inhibition of direct acting DNA reactive agents by 63 non-starter lactobacilli isolated from raw ewes milk cheeses was examined by short-term assay (SOS-Chromotest) and compared with already characterized starter lactobacilli. The screening revealed strains active against the nitroarene 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO) and the alkylating agent N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in different species of the genus Lactobacillus (L. rhamnosus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. brevis, Lactobacillus spp.). It was proved that the anti-genotoxicity was strain-dependent, and always associated with spectroscopic modification of genotoxins. The frequency of strains inhibiting nitroarene genotoxicity was comparable for non-starter and starter lactobacilli, whereas inhibition of the alkylating agent was largely predominant in non-starter isolates. Seventeen strains presented inhibitory activity against both genotoxins. DNA RAPD-PCR performed with M13, Pro-Up and RPO2 primers on the lactobacilli under examination showed genetic diversity in these strains. The non-starter isolates clustered in seven groups and the strains presenting a high degree of activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide clustered in a single group with a similarity around 75%. Interestingly, the strains with anti-genotoxic properties also showed acid-bile tolerance, indicating that the autochthonous lactobacilli which survive cheese ripening may also reach the gut as viable cells and could prevent genotoxin DNA damage to enterocytes, as is desirable for probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  - We determined the maximum pH that allows growth (pHmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. High alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of Lactobacillus casei, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. curvatus, L. pentosus, and L. plantarum that originated from plant material, with pHmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. Among these, L. casei NRIC 1917 and L. paracasei subsp. tolerans NRIC 1940 showed the highest pHmax, at 8.9. Digestive tract isolates of L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and L. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. Dairy isolates of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and L. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. Measurement of the internal pH of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (DeltapH) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-pH ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. Thus, the reversed DeltapH did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. However, the DeltapH contributed to alkali tolerance, as the pHmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates DeltapH. Although neutral external-pH values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance, substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a pH range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. Therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.
TI  - Lactobacillus composti sp. nov., a lactic acid bacterium isolated from a compost  of distilled shochu residue.
AB  - Two strains of lactic acid bacteria, strains NRIC 0689(T) and NRIC 0690, were isolated from a compost of distilled shochu residue in Japan. The isolates showed quite low sequence similarity to known species of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence; the highest sequence similarities to NRIC 0689(T) were shown by the type strains of Lactobacillus satsumensis, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. buchneri and L. parabuchneri (92.9, 92.9, 92.8, 92.6 and 92.5 %, respectively). The isolates formed a distinct subcluster in the Lactobacillus casei-Pediococcus phylogenetic cluster. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness revealed that the isolates belonged to the same taxon. Therefore, the isolates represent a novel species, for which the name Lactobacillus composti sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NRIC 0689(T) (=JCM 14202(T)=DSM 18527(T)).
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - Nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard Argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  - Nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from Argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. Lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and soft cheeses made with multistrain Streptococcus thermophilus starters. Lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) CFU/g and then reached 10(7) CFU/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always above 10(9) CFU/g. A total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. Species identity was determined by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific PCR assays. Genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis. The Lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, and L. perolens. All the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. After incubation in gastric solution (pH 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. The strains were able to grow in the presence of bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. The nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). Some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. It was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.
TI  - Quantitative evaluation of adhesion of lactobacilli isolated from human intestinal tissues to human colonic mucin using surface plasmon resonance (BIACORE assay).
AB  - AIMS: To isolate lactobacilli from the mucus layer of the human intestine and evaluate their adhesion abilities using a BIACORE assay. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the mucus layer of normal human intestinal tissues using conventional plate culture. The strains were identified using homology comparisons of the 16S rDNA sequence to databases as Lactobacillus salivarius (26%), Lactobacillus fermentum (13%), Lactobacillus gasseri (10%), Lactobacillus paracasei (7%), Lactobacillus casei (3%), Lactobacillus mucosae (3%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (3%). Lactobacillus plantarum LA 318 shows the highest adhesion to human colonic mucin (HCM) using the BIACORE assay at 115.30 +/- 12.37 resonance unit (RU). The adhesion of cell wall surface proteins from strain LA 318 was significantly higher to HCM than to bovine serum albumin (BSA; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We isolated 30 strains of lactobacilli. Lactobacillus salivarius was the predominant species of lactobacilli isolated in this study. The adhesion of strain LA 318 isolated from human transverse colon to its mucin was shown. The adhesion could be mediated by lectin-like components on the bacterial cell surface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study where lactobacilli were isolated from human intestinal tissues and shown to adhere to HCM.
TI  - [Study on application of rep-PCR fingerprint in rapid identification of beer-spoilager].
AB  - The application potential of rep-PCR in typing beer-spoilage isolates was studied. The effects of different factors, including DNA templates and primers, on the quality and reproducibility of fingerprints were investigated. The CTAB protocol was shown to be the feasible method for DNA extraction. Primers BOXA1R and (GTG)5 were used in rep-PCR, and the PCR products were sequenced to identify strains isolated from two breweries. Rep-PCR fingerprint profiles were obtained by using GelCompar II software. Cluster analysis showed that the isolates belonging to Lactobacillus brevis, L. buchneri, L. casei/paracasei, L. plantarum are divided into 2 or 3 subgroups. In addition, the two rep-PCR fingerprint profiles complemented with each other in typing these isolates. Combining the similarity coefficient cut-off (SCC) of species, 9 unknown isolates were identified rapidly by using both fingerprint databases. The results indicate that rep-PCR is a simple, reliable and promising method for rapid identification of beer-spoilager.
TI  - [Influence of selected Lactobacillus sp. on Clostridium difficile strains with different toxigenicity profile].
AB  - This study was performed for determination of antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus spp. (L. plantarum 2017405, L. rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus DSM 21007 and L. fernmentumn 353) on Clostridiunl difficile strains belonging to different toxigenicity profiles. Forty strains C. difficile isolated from patients suffering from antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) were used. Among C. difficile strains 13 produced toxin A and B (A+B+CDT-), 14 produced only toxin B (AB'CDT), 9 produced toxins A and B and possessing of binary toxin genes (A+B+CDT-) and 4 were non-toxigenic (A-B-CDT-). We did not observe relationship between degree of antagonistic activity Lactobacillus spp. and profile of toxigenicity of C. difficile strains.
TI  - Detoxification of mycotoxins by probiotic preparation for broiler chickens.
AB  - Biological decontamination of mycotoxins using microorganisms is one of the well  known strategies for the management of mycotoxins in foods and feeds. Among the different potential decontaminating microorganisms,Saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria represent unique groups, which are widely used in food fermentation and preservation. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of spontaneous fermentation with the use of probiotic bacteria and yeast (Lactobacillus paracasei/casei LOCK 0920,L. brevis LOCK 0944,L. plantarum LOCK 0945,Saccharomyces cerevisiae LOCK 0142), on reduction of sum of aflatoxines (B1, B2, G1, G2) and ochratoxin A concentration during fermentation and the microflora pattern during fermentaton. The probiotic bacteria and yeast applied creates a starter culture for flour fermentation that has a stable feature of detoxication of aflatoxines and especially ochratoxin A.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory effect of bioflora probiotic administered orally or subcutaneously with live or dead bacteria.
AB  - The anti-inflammatory effect of Bioflora probiotic administered orally or subcutaneously with viable or nonviable bacteria was analyzed in two experimental models of randomly selected female Wistar rats. The use of indomethacin at a dose of 50 mg/kg was associated with gastric necrotic lesions and multiple erosions of the small intestine, with marked mucosal neutrophil infiltrate measured by myeloperoxidase (MPO). Probiotics prevented both gastrointestinal lesions and neutrophil infiltrate (p < 0.001). In the model of carrageenin-induced plantar edema in the rat, the oral or subcutaneous administration of Bioflora with live or dead bacteria proved to prevent plantar edema (p < 0.001). We concluded that Bioflora probiotic given orally or subcutaneously with live or dead bacteria has an anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - Expression of the immunity protein of plantaricin 423, produced by Lactobacillus  plantarum 423, and analysis of the plasmid encoding the bacteriocin.
AB  - Plantaricin 423 is a class IIa bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from sorghum beer. It has been previously determined that plantaricin 423 is encoded by a plasmid designated pPLA4, which is now completely sequenced. The plantaricin 423 operon shares high sequence similarity with the operons of coagulin, pediocin PA-1, and pediocin AcH, with small differences in the DNA sequence encoding the mature bacteriocin peptide and the immunity protein. Apart from the bacteriocin operon, no significant sequence similarity could be detected between the DNA or translated sequence of pPLA4 and the available DNA or translated sequences of the plasmids encoding pediocin AcH, pediocin PA-1, and coagulin, possibly indicating a different origin. In addition to the bacteriocin operon, sequence analysis of pPLA4 revealed the presence of two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a putative mobilization (Mob) protein that is homologous to the pMV158 superfamily of mobilization proteins. Highest sequence similarity occurred between this protein and the Mob protein of L. plantarum NCDO 1088. ORF2 encodes a putative replication protein that revealed low sequence similarity to replication proteins of plasmids pLME300 from Lactobacillus fermentum and pYIT356 from Lactobacillus casei. The immunity protein of plantaricin 423 contains 109 amino acids. Although plantaricin 423 shares high sequence similarity with the pediocin PA-1 operon, no cross-reactivity was recorded between the immunity proteins of plantaricin 423 and pediocin PA-1.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Non-enterococcal Gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious infections. However, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. Because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the MICs of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. The activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; Lactobacillus casei, 1; Lactobacillus fermentum, 2; Lactobacillus brevis, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1; Weissella confusa, 2; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; Leuconostoc lactis, 4; Pediococcus acidilactici, 2; Pediococcus pentosaceus, 1), isolated from clinical specimens in an Argentinian university hospital from 1997 to 2003. The MICs of penicillin for 67% of the Lactobacillus strains and 100% of the Leuconostoc spp. and Pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/mL range. Erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. Multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1).
TI  - Inhibition of Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis and expression of Hsp70 in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells after exposure to non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  - Oral administration of lactobacilli as probiotics is gaining importance in the treatment of intestinal inflammations. We investigated the effect of non-starter lactobacilli Lactobacillus casei subsp casei 2756, Lactobacillus curvatus 2775, and Lactobacillus plantarum 2142 as well as their spent culture supernatants (SCS) on Salmonella enteritidis 857 growth, interleukin (IL)-8 and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) synthesis in undifferentiated crypt-like and differentiated villus-like Caco-2 cells. The cells were infected with graded numbers of non-starter lactobacilli or S. enteritidis 857 for 1 h and allowed to recover for 24 h or exposed to 200 bacteria/cell for 1 h and allowed to recover for different periods of time. In another experiment S. enteritidis 857 was first pre-treated with SCS-lactobacilli for 1 h before infecting the cells. The levels of IL-8 and Hsp70 were assessed using sandwich ELISA and immunostaining of Western blots, respectively. The effect of SCS-lactobacilli on S. enteritidis 857 growth was evaluated by agar plate diffusion test. The non-starter lactobacilli induced a significant increase in the levels of both IL-8 and Hsp70. However, compared with the S. enteritidis 857 induced IL-8 synthesis, the levels of IL-8 induced by the lactobacilli at any equivalent bacterial number were far lower. After exposure of Caco-2 cells to S. enteritidis 857 pre-treated with SCS-lactobacilli, it appeared that their SCS inhibited the S. enteritidis 857 growth and IL-8 synthesis and in addition induced the expression of Hsp70. The differences in response of crypt- and villus-like Caco-2 cells are merely a reflection of their differentiation status. Our data suggest that the beneficial effect of non-starter lactobacilli to the intestinal inflammations might be associated with a decrease of the IL-8 levels. This effect could be mediated, at least in part, by the bacteria themselves or via a secreted antimicrobial product(s) either directly against the pathogens or indirectly through the synthesis of Hsp70.
TI  - Cariogenic bacteria and caries risk in elderly Japanese aged 80 and older with at least 20 teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess caries risk and check the presence of four commonly found oral cariogenic bacteria in "8020" achievers. DESIGN: Initial report based on Japan's newly implemented "8020" campaign, which aims to promote health and awareness in older people. Simply stated, the goal is, at 80 years, to maintain 20 teeth. SETTING: Healthy community-dwelling elderly individuals of Okayama Prefecture, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty individuals aged 80 and older with 20 of their own natural teeth. MEASUREMENTS: General and oral health conditions, caries risk assessment using the Cariostat method, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of four oral cariogenic bacteria. RESULTS: The participants had an average of 24.7 teeth, of which 12.1 were sound, 12.2 were treated, and 0.4 were untreated. Based on Cariostat scores, 64.4% had low caries risk. Using PCR, Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, and L. plantarum were detected in 51.3%, 23.1%, 40%, and 25% of the participants, respectively. S. mutans (P<.001), S. sobrinus (P=.002), L. casei (P<.001), and L. plantarum (P=.001) deoxyribonucleic acid band was detected more in participants with high caries risk scores. CONCLUSION: Participants with low caries risk scores had low prevalence of cariogenic bacteria, 20 or more sound teeth, and fewer missing teeth. Incorporating caries risk assessment, using the Cariostat and PCR analysis, in the "8020" campaign in health systems worldwide will contribute to a better life for the aging society, initiate research interest regarding the program, and improve current health policies.
TI  - Inhibition of Listeria innocua growth by antimicrobial-producing lactic acid cultures in vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon.
AB  - The biopreservative potential of three antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria strains was evaluated on cold-smoked salmon. Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Carnobacterium piscicola were added singly or in association to cold-smoked salmon, artificially contaminated with Listeria innocua and stored under vacuum for 30 days at 4 degrees C. All the lactic cultures were able to inhibit Listeria innocua growth, showing a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect, without affecting negatively the sensory quality of the product. Lactobacillus casei was bacteriostatic when inoculated at 6 log cfu/g, but bactericidal at 8 log cfu/g, reducing Listeria innocua of 3.3 log cfu/g in comparison with the test at the end of storage. Lactobacillus plantarum and C. piscicola strains, inoculated singly at 6 log cfu/g reduced Listeria innocua counts of 2.8 and 2.7 log cfu/g, respectively, compared with the test. The association Lactobacillus casei-Lactobacillus plantarum was the most effective among the treatments with 6 log cfu/g inoculum, as Listeria innocua counts decreased of 3.2 log cfu/g compared with the test. The treatment with Lactobacillus casei-C. piscicola association was less effective than C. piscicola alone.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Production of a heterologous nonheme catalase by Lactobacillus casei: an efficient tool for removal of H2O2 and protection of Lactobacillus bulgaricus from oxidative stress in milk.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally sensitive to H2O2, a compound that they  can paradoxically produce themselves, as is the case for Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14431 is one of the very few LAB strains able to degrade H2O2 through the action of a nonheme, manganese-dependent catalase (hereafter called MnKat). The MnKat gene was expressed in three catalase-deficient LAB species: L. bulgaricus ATCC 11842, Lactobacillus casei BL23, and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. While the protein could be detected in all heterologous hosts, enzyme activity was observed only in L. casei. This is probably due to the differences in the Mn contents of the cells, which are reportedly similar in L. plantarum and L. casei but at least 10- and 100-fold lower in Lactococcus lactis and L. bulgaricus, respectively. The expression of the MnKat gene in L. casei conferred enhanced oxidative stress resistance, as measured by an increase in the survival rate after exposure to H2O2, and improved long-term survival in aerated cultures. In mixtures of L. casei producing MnKat and L. bulgaricus, L. casei can eliminate H2O2 from the culture medium, thereby protecting both L. casei and L. bulgaricus from its deleterious effects.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  - Probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. The mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (LA) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from LA by certain bacterial strains. In this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of CLA was assessed. Incubation of probiotic bacteria (VSL3, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, B. infantis, B. longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of LA yielded CLA production as measured by gas chromatography. Conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced CLA, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, as assessed by MTT assay and DNA laddering, respectively. Western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of PPARgamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with LA alone. Incubation of murine feces with LA after administering VSL3 yielded 100-fold more CLA than feces collected prior to VSL3 feeding. This study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.
TI  - Influence of phenol, p-cresol and indole on growth and survival of intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Some intestinal bacteria can produce many genotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic substances. The major products of the bacterial aromatic amino acids fermentation-phenolic and indolic compounds which are responsible for colon cancer development are accumulated in the colon. The effect of phenol, p-cresol and indole (2, 20 and 100 microg/ml doses) on growth and survival of four strains of intestinal lactic acid bacteria was studied. Growth of bacteria was not affected by any of the concentrations of phenol and p-cresol tested. The growth of 2 strains was slightly inhibited by 100 microg/ml of indole. There was no influence of phenol and p-cresol on survival of lactic bacteria until 120 h and specific reaction to carcinogens depending on strain was observed after that incubation time. Indole concentrations 20 and 100 microg/ml appeared to be toxic for all tested strains but just after 24, 48 or 72 h of incubation depending on the strain. In total, 2 microg/ml of indole had a very little effect.
TI  - Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of fecal Lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  - The developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. Generally, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. In intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. However, the Lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. For accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rRNA intergenic spacer regions, were developed for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different Lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (SF) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (OSF). A breast-fed group (BF) was studied in parallel as a reference. During the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the BF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the OSF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). The Lactobacillus species distribution in the OSF group was comparable to breast-fed infants, with relatively high levels of L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, and L. casei. The SF-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more L. delbrueckii and less L. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and OSF-fed infants. An infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of BF infants.
TI  - The effect of prebiotics on production of antimicrobial compounds, resistance to  growth at low pH and in the presence of bile, and adhesion of probiotic cells to intestinal mucus.
AB  - AIMS: Screening of five bile salt-resistant and low pH-tolerant lactic acid bacteria for inhibitory activity against lactic acid bacteria and bacterial strains isolated from the faeces of children with HIV/AIDS. Determining the effect of prebiotics and soy milk-base on cell viability and adhesion of cells to intestinal mucus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum 423, Lactobacillus casei LHS, Lactobacillus salivarius 241, Lactobacillus curvatus DF 38 and Pediococcus pentosaceus 34 produced the highest level of antimicrobial activity (12,800 AU ml(-1)) when grown in MRS broth supplemented with 2% (m/v) dextrose. Growth in the presence of Raftilose Synergy1, Raftilose L95 and Raftiline GR did not lead to increased levels of antimicrobial activity. Cells grown in the presence of Raftilose Synergy1 took longer to adhere to intestinal mucus, whilst cells grown in the absence of prebiotics showed a linear rate of binding. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited. Dextrose stimulated the production of antimicrobial compounds. Adhesion to intestinal mucus did not increase with the addition of prebiotics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strains may be incorporated in food supplements for HIV/AIDS patients suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders.
TI  - Induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen A.
AB  - Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.
TI  - Use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral Lactobacillus species.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The genus Lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. A considerable heterogeneity among Lactobacillus species has been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA (16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for the identification of 13 reference strains of Lactobacillus. METHODS: The 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified by PCR using universal primers and digestion of PCR products with the restriction endonucleases, HpaII and HaeIII. The 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating Lactobacillus strains to species level. Seventy-seven Lactobacillus isolates from a Thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. RESULTS: PCR-RFLP alone had limitations, because the RFLP patterns of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus and of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by SDS-PAGE. Of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as L. rhamnosus, 5 as Lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as L. casei, 3 as L. acidophilus and 1 as Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP, using HpaII and HaeIII, together with SDS-PAGE protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral Lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of Lactobacillus to dental caries.
TI  - Strain typing with ISLpl1 in lactobacilli.
AB  - Twenty-seven Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum, 11 Lactobacillus paraplantarum and five Lactobacillus casei-related strains, isolated from various autochthonous Serbian and Montenegro-fermented foods, were identified using phenotypical characterization and current PCR methods based on PCR of the recA gene or the 23S-5S rRNA gene intragenic spacer (IS) region. The strains were genotypically characterized by a new method based on the insertion sequence element ISLpl11 that grouped these lactobacilli into 10 IS-fingerprinting groups. Between six and 23 copies of the ISLpl1 were found in each strain and the ISLpl1-fingerprint groups correlated well with the origin of the strains. The method proved suitable for strain typing of lactic acid bacteria at the infraspecies level.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
AB  - Six Lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota, L. johnsonii La1, L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and L. rhamnosus GG) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344. All lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this Gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells. By studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and pH control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. The antibacterial activity of L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota and L. rhamnosus GG was solely due to the production of lactic acid. The antibacterial activity of L. johnsonii La1 and L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). The latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. In addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of Salmonella into Caco-2/TC7 cells.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
TI  - A comparative study and phage typing of silage-making Lactobacillus bacteriophages.
AB  - To investigate basic characteristics of 10 virulent phages active on silage-making lactobacilli, morphological properties, host ranges, protein composition and genome characterization were separated into five groups based on host ranges and basic properties. The seven phages of groups I, II and V were active on Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus. Phage phiPY4 (group III) infected both L. casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Phage phiPY5 (group IV) specifically infected Lactobacillus casei. Morphologically, three phages of groups I belonged to the Myoviridae family, while seven other phages of groups II, III and V belonged to the Siphoviridae family. SDS-PAGE profiles, restriction analysis, G + C contents of DNA and Dot blot hybridization revealed a high degree of homology in each group. Clustering derived from host range analysis was closely related to results of DNA and protein analyses. These phages may be applicable to phage typing for silage-making lactobacilli.
TI  - Development of a host-vector system for Lactobacillus plantarum L137 isolated from a traditional fermented food produced in the Philippines.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum NC13, a strain derived from the L. plantarum strain L137  isolated from a traditional fermented food produced in the Philippines, contains 9 of the 15 plasmids in the parental strain. To construct a shuttle vector between L. plantarum and Escherichia coli for genetic manipulation of L137 and its derivatives, recombinant plasmids were prepared by using the 9-plasmid DNA mixture and an E. coli vector, pBluescript II SK+. The resultant recombinant plasmids were re-transferred to L. plantarum NCL21, an NC13-derived strain cured of 3 of the 9 plasmids, and 3 recombinant plasmids were obtained. The smallest plasmid, pRN14, contained a small cryptic plasmid, pLTK2, which is one of the plasmids in L. plantarum L137. Thus, the complete nucleotide sequence of pLTK2 was determined. The pLTK2 is 2295 bp in length, and has a major open reading frame of 951 bp. An encoded sequence of 317-amino acids showed extensive similarity with genes encoding replication protein (repA). A putative replication origin in pLTK2 also showed high homology to those of other gram-positive bacterial plasmids that replicate by the rolling circle mechanism. The shuttle vector pRN14 contained the erythromycin resistance gene and the ColE1 and pLTK2 replication origins. Transformation of L. plantarum strains with pRN14 by electroporation was optimized to give a transformation efficiency of 2 x 10(4) transformants/ mug plasmid. Plasmid pRN14 was stably maintained in strain NCL21, as well as in L. casei K95-5.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - [Antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. DESIGN: review of literature. SETTING: Charles University at Prague, Pharmaceutical Faculty at Hradec Kralove. METHODS: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. CONCLUSIONS: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. The efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of C. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. Essential oils present in the Cayenne pepper (Capsodum frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against C. albicans as well. Clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. The effects of Chinese leek are similar to garlic. Propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the yeast strains decreases in the following order: C. albicans > C. tropicalis > C. crusei > C. guilliermondii. Its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. Tea trea oil (Melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of Candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for C. crusei and C. norvengensis. In the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of Lactobacilus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14, B-54 may be recommended. Moreover there are suitable strains of L. brevis CD-2, L. salivarius FV-2, L. gasseri MB 335, L. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (L. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (L. gasseri). The strains of L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with Candida. It should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus (especially L. casei and L. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract. No protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin E, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.
TI  - Rapid identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus by restriction analysis of the  16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and flanking 23S rRNA gene.
AB  - A rapid molecular approach was developed for the initial identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains which are difficult to identify using a single biochemical test. The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions and flanking 23S rRNA genes of 19 strains of lactobacilli were amplified and the nucleotide sequences and restriction site polymorphisms were analyzed. AluI was the most useful of the restriction enzymes analyzed and produced reproducible digestion profiles in the L. helveticus, L. plantarum, and L. casei groups, as well as in L. acidophilus. This restriction fragment length polymorphism method may be useful for the identification of L. acidophilus strains in dairy products.
TI  - Production of probiotic cabbage juice by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Research was undertaken to determine the suitability of cabbage as a raw material for production of probiotic cabbage juice by lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum C3, Lactobacillus casei A4, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii D7). Cabbage juice was inoculated with a 24-h-old lactic culture and incubated at 30 degrees C. Changes in pH, acidity, sugar content, and viable cell counts during fermentation under controlled conditions were monitored. L. casei, L. delbrueckii, and L. plantarum grew well on cabbage juice and reached nearly 10x10(8) CFU/mL after 48 h of fermentation at 30 degrees C. L. casei, however, produced a smaller amount of titratable acidity expressed as lactic acid than L. delbrueckii or L. plantarum. After 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees C, the viable cell counts of L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii were still 4.1x10(7) and 4.5x10(5) mL(-1), respectively. L. casei did not survive the low pH and high acidity conditions in fermented cabbage juice and lost cell viability completely after 2 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees C. Fermented cabbage juice could serve as a healthy beverage for vegetarians and lactose-allergic consumers.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, structural organization and host range of pRS4, a small cryptic Pediococcus pentosaceus plasmid that contains two cassettes commonly found in other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the cryptic plasmid pRS4 (3550 bp) from Pediococcus pentosaceus RS4 was determined. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of three open reading frames (ORFs). The putative protein coded by ORF 1 showed 93% identity with the mobilization protein of Lactobacillus casei plasmid pLC88 and 94% identity with a sequenced fragment of the mobilization protein of P. damnosus plasmid pF8801, suggesting a common origin for these three mobilization proteins. The putative protein coded by ORF 2 showed 92% identity with the replication protein of L. plantarum plasmid pWCFS101, a plasmid that replicates via the rolling circle (RC) mechanism, suggesting a similar replication mechanism for pRS4. Supporting this hypothesis, a putative double strand origin (dso) and a region with palindromic sequences that could function as single strand origin (sso), were detected in pRS4. A function could not be assigned to ORF 3. Since ORF 1 exhibits high identity with L. casei plasmid pLC88 but lower identity (58%) with other Lactobacillus plasmids, and ORF 2 exhibits high identity with the L. plantarum plasmid pWCFS101 but lower identity (55-58%) with other Lactobacillus plasmids (including pLC88), two independent cassettes, from different sources, seem to be involved in the structure of pRS4. Plasmids derived from pRS4 containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene were successfully electrotransformed in L. plantarum, L. casei, P. pentosaceus, and Pediococcus acidilactici, suggesting that pRS4 could be used as a cloning vector for lactic acid bacteria. To our knowledge pRS4 is the first RC-replicating plasmid of P. pentosaceus that has been completely sequenced and used as cloning vector.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Characterisation of lab in typical Salento Pecorino cheese.
AB  - Twenty-nine strains of Lactic Acid Bacteria isolated from the typical Pecorino cheese of the Salento area of Italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. A preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. For the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene was employed In addition, restriction analysis of amplified rDNA (ARDRA) and PCR and AFLP fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated UPGMA cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. The data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of Pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. The main identified strains were Lactobacillus brevis, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. sakei, L. pentosus, L. farciminis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
TI  - Selective probiotic bacteria induce IL-10-producing regulatory T cells in vitro by modulating dendritic cell function through dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacilli are probiotic bacteria that are frequently tested in the management of allergic diseases or gastroenteritis. It is hypothesized that these probiotics have immunoregulatory properties and promote mucosal tolerance, which is in part mediated by regulatory T cells (Treg cells). On the basis of pathogenic or tissue-specific priming, dendritic cells (DC) acquire different T cell-instructive signals and drive the differentiation of naive T H cells into either T H 1, T H 2, or regulatory effector T cells. OBJECTIVE: We studied in what way different species of lactobacilli prime human DCs for their ability to drive Treg cells. METHODS: Human monocyte-derived DCs were cultured in vitro with lactobacilli of different species. RESULTS: Two different species of lactobacilli, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei , but not Lactobacillus plantarum, prime monocyte-derived DCs to drive the development of Treg cells. These Treg cells produced increased levels of IL-10 and were capable of inhibiting the proliferation of bystander T cells in an IL-10-dependent fashion. Strikingly, both L reuteri and L casei , but not L plantarum , bind the C-type lectin DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN). Blocking antibodies to DC-SIGN inhibited the induction of the Treg cells by these probiotic bacteria, stressing that ligation of DC-SIGN can actively prime DCs to induce Treg cells. CONCLUSIONS: The targeting of DC-SIGN by certain probiotic bacteria might explain their beneficial effect in the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis and Crohn's disease.
TI  - Enumeration and identification of pediococci in powder-based products using selective media and rapid PFGE.
AB  - In this study, pediococci selective medium (PSM) was evaluated for the enumeration of Pediococcus acidilactici and Pediococcus pentosaceus from probiotic animal feed and silage inoculants. PSM is based on the complex basal medium MRS supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride, novobiocin, vancomycin, and nystatin. No significant change in electivity was observed when pediococci where recovered from culture or powder-based products following incubation at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 24 h. The medium was suitable for the enumeration of pediococci in samples also containing bacilli, bifidobacteria, enterococci, lactobacilli, lactococci, propionibacteria, streptococci, and yeast components. However, to inhibit Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei, ampicillin was added and the revised medium, termed PSM+A, was also considered to be suitably elective for pediococci recovered from powder. In addition, a rapid PFGE protocol is presented, which allows Pediococcus species and strain verification from colonies in less than 3 days.
TI  - Screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  - Antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  The ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. The study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (SOS-Chromotest for genotoxicity in Escherichia coli and Ames test for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (Comet assay for genotoxicity in Caco-2 enterocytes). A high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus plantarum. Inhibition of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one L. acidophilus strain. All the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. Strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. Concordance of the results obtained with microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - [Probiotics as therapeutic agents in irritable bowel syndrome].
AB  - Probiotics are defined as living micro-organisms which, when administered in large amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. The use of probiotics in the therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. Also, in several studies proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the course of irritable bowel syndrome. Some trials showed a significant improvement of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via Lactobacillus casei Shirota and E. coli Nissle 1917. Lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in reducing pain and abdominal bloating. However, in most of the studies rather small numbers of patients were examined. Furthermore, these studies do not always closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled). Therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.
TI  - Biodiversity of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains isolated from five sourdoughs.
AB  - AIMS: Five different sourdoughs were investigated for the composition of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the biodiversity of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 57 strains were isolated from five sourdoughs. Isolated strains were all identified by the 16S rDNA sequence and species-specific primers for L. sanfranciscensis. Results of identification showed that LAB strains were L. sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus pontis, Lactobacillus casei, Weisella confusa and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A total of 21 strains were identified as L. sanfranciscensis and these isolates were detected in all five sourdoughs. Ribotyping was applied to investigate the relationship between intraspecies diversity of L. sanfranciscensis and sourdough. A total of 22 strains of L. sanfranciscensis including L. sanfranciscensis JCM 5668T were compared by ribotyping. The dendrogram of 21 ribotyping patterns showed four clusters, and L. sanfranciscensis JCM 5668T was independent of the others. The different biotypes of L. sanfranciscensis were present in two sourdoughs compared with other three sourdoughs. CONCLUSIONS: The LAB compositions of five sourdoughs were different and the relationship between intraspecies diversity of L. sanfranciscensis strains and five sourdoughs was shown by ribotyping. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated that ribotyping was useful for distinguishing L. sanfranciscensis strains. A further important result is that the intra-species diversity of L. sanfranciscensis strains seems to be related to the sourdough preparation.
TI  - Probiotication of tomato juice by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the suitability of tomato juice as a raw material for production of probiotic juice by four lactic acid bacteria (Latobacillus acidophilus LA39, Lactobacillus plantarum C3, Lactobacillus casei A4, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii D7). Tomato juice was inoculated with a 24-h-old culture and incubated at 30 degrees C. Changes in pH, acidity, sugar content, and viable cell counts during fermentation under controlled conditions were measured. The lactic acid cultures reduced the pH to 4.1 or below and increased the acidity to 0.65% or higher, and the viable cell counts (CFU) reached nearly 1.0 to 9.0 x 10(9)/ml after 72 h fermentation. The viable cell counts of the four lactic acid bacteria in the fermented tomato juice ranged from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml after 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees C. Probiotic tomato juice could serve as a health beverage for vegetarians or consumers who are allergic to dairy products.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria from sourdoughs for Altamura  bread produced in Apulia (Southern Italy).
AB  - In order to study the composition of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) community of  sourdoughs used for the manufacture of Altamura bread, a traditional durum wheat bread produced in Apulia (Southern Italy), 111 strains of LAB were isolated and characterized. The phenotypic characterization of the isolates, carried out using a set of 29 tests, allowed the identification of 15 clusters at the 80% similarity level by hierarchical cluster analysis. Of the isolates, 88% were identified as facultatively heterofermentative LAB (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. paracasei, Lb. casei) and 12% as heterofermentative LAB (Lb. brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides). SDS-PAGE profiles of whole cell proteins of 68 strains confirmed the identification. Both the diversity and structure of the lactic microflora for sourdoughs for Altamura bread varied among samples.
TI  - Succinate production and citrate catabolism by Cheddar cheese nonstarter lactobacilli.
AB  - AIMS: To identify strains of Cheddar cheese nonstarter lactobacilli that synthesize succinate from common precursors and characterize the biochemical pathways utilized. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole cell incubations of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus zeae and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, were used to identify strains that accumulated succinate from citrate, l-lactate, aspartic acid or isocitrate. In vivo 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C-NMR) identified the biochemical pathway involved at pH 7.0, and under conditions more representative of the cheese ripening environment (pH 5.1/4% NaCl/13 degrees C). Enzyme assays on cell-free extracts were used to support the pathway suggested by 13C-NMR. CONCLUSIONS: The Lact. plantarum strains studied synthesize succinate from citrate by the reductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle at either pH 7.0 or pH 5.1/4% NaCl/13 degrees C. Lactobacillus casei, Lact. zeae and Lact. rhamnosus strains lack one or more enzymatic activities present in this pathway, and do not accumulate succinate from any of the four precursors studied. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The addition of Lact. plantarum strains to milk during cheese manufacture may increase the accumulation of the flavour enhancer succinate.
TI  - In vitro screening of potential probiotic activities of selected lactobacilli isolated from unpasteurized milk products for incorporation into soft cheese.
AB  - The aim was to select potentially probiotic lactobacilli from 88 strains isolated from unpasteurized milk and cheese products, and to incorporate these bacteria in a viable state into a soft cheese, without changing its quality. The survival of these bacteria was assessed in acidic and bile conditions, after freezing at -80 degrees C. Four strains from unpasteurized Camembert--two Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lb. paracasei/casei strains--were identified and typed by PCR and PFGE and were found to display potentially probiotic characteristics in addition to resistance to low pH and bile. These characteristics were resistance to lysozyme, adhesion to CACO-2 cells, antimicrobial effects against common foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, innocuity following the ingestion of high doses by mice and appropriate antibiotic susceptibility profiles. The potential of Lb. plantarum strain UCMA 3037 for incorporation into a soft cheese (Pont-l'Eveque registered designation of origin (RDO)) was investigated. This strain grew well and survived in sufficient numbers (more than 10(7) cfu/g throughout the shelf-life of the product) in the cheese. This strain did not change the quality score of the product until the best before date (75 days after manufacture). Thus, unpasteurized Camembert is a natural source of potentially probiotic lactobacilli, which could be used as an additive in the development of potentially probiotic soft cheeses. Further work is required to demonstrate the persistence and efficacy of these strains in the human host upon ingestion.
TI  - [Quantitative characterization of antagonistic activity of lactobacilli].
AB  - In this work the method of serial dilutions of lactobacilli in two-layer agar was used. On the agar surface bacterial or fungal cultures were applied at different time intervals. A special quantitative characteristic was introduced. L. plantarum strain 8P-A3 was shown to have the maximum antagonistic activity. In great amounts L. casei and L. reuteri are capable to suppress the growth of bacteria and fungi. All lactobacilli under study produced a pronounced bactericidal effect on Pseudomonas, had different influence on the viability of Escherichia and staphylococci and exhibited fungistatic and fungicidal action only when inoculated at high concentrations.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes in green table olives.
AB  - Microbiological safety of green table olives from different cultivars, prepared by both the Spanish-style and biological methods and fermented with starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus pentosus), was investigated. The fermentation process was monitored by measuring pH values, titratable acidities, and growth of lactic acid bacteria over time. During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were major microbial populations. Microbiological safety was evaluated by analysis for Listeria monocytogenes with the use of an enrichment method during storage (from 55 days to 18 months). Results demonstrated that L. monocytogenes can survive and grow in green table olives. L. monocytogenes was found in one of the commercial (thermally treated) samples analyzed and in all samples older than 2 months, irrespective of olive cultivar, lactic acid bacteria starter used, pH and titratable acidity of brine samples, or treatment applied.
TI  - Optimization of bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - The cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin ST13BR, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, inhibits the growth of L. casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Based on tricine-SDS-PAGE, bacteriocin ST13BR is 10 kDa in size. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after treatment with Proteinase K, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. Low bacteriocin activity (200 AU/ml) was recorded in BHI medium, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. Maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded after 23 h in MRS broth, but only at 30 degrees C. Tween 80 in MRS broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. Meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in MRS broth, stimulated bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml). Only 50% activity (3,200 AU/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 AU/ml. Bacteriocin production was not stimulated by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 AU/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 AU/ml). Activity levels less than 200 AU/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. Maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. Maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. The presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher KH(2)PO(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.
TI  - Rapid identification of probiotic Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16S rRNA through 23S rRNA.
AB  - This study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic Lactobacillus species such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16S and 23S rRNA genes and their rRNA intergenic spacer region of each species. It was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the general biochemical methods. The phylogenetic analyses, using 16S rDNA sequences of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex PCR assay were trustworthy. Taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Evaluation of vinification lees as a general medium for lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Lactobacillus species present high nutritional requirements, so it is necessary to find new low-cost nutrient components for fermentation media. This work compares the utilization of vinification lees (an important residue of wineries) from red and white winemaking technology, distilled or not. An amount of 20 g of lees/L was used as the unique nutrient to obtain lactic acid from glucose using Lactobacillus strains with different properties: L. plantarum CECT-221, L. pentosus CECT-4023, L. casei CECT-5275, and L. coryniformis subsp. torquens CECT-25600. Only L. casei using distilled lees showed values (Pmax = 92.1 g/L and Y(P/S) = 1.05 g/g) similar to those obtained with the MRS broth. The UV spectra of white and red lees, distilled or not, allowed an interpretation of the different phenolic compounds present and their influence on the fermentation. Their detoxification by extraction with organic compounds and fermentation with L. pentosus was also considered. Time courses of glucose and lactic acid were modeled according to reported models to obtain more information about the process.
TI  - Metabolic activities of Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from kefir.
AB  - A total of 21 strains of Lactobacillus species were isolated from Turkish kefir samples, in order to select the most suitable strains according to their metabolic activities including probiotic properties. As a result of the identification tests, 21 Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. acidophilus (4%), L. helveticus (9%), L. brevis (9%), L. bulgaricus (14%), L. plantarum (14%), L. casei (19%) and L. lactis (28%). The amount of produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, proteolytic activity, and acetaldehyde productions of Lactobacillus spp. were determined. Different amounts of lactic acid were produced by strains studies; however, lactic acid levels were 1.7-11.4 mg/mL. All strains produced hydrogen peroxide. L. bulgaricus Z14L strain showed no proteolytic activity, L. casei Z6L strain produced the maximum amount (0.16 mg/mL) of proteolytic activity. Acetaldehyde concentration produced in Lactobacillus strains ranged between 0.88-3.52 microg/mL.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - In vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (TD-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and Corynebacterium spp.
AB  - Telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. We determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 Corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards procedures. Plates with daptomycin were supplemented with Ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. The MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: Actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium ramosum (n = 16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; Clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; Eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and Corynebacterium spp. (n = 31), 0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of TD-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except C. clostridioforme and Lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more active. Daptomycin had decreased activity (MIC > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains of Actinomyces spp. and all C. ramosum, Eubacterium lentum, and Lactobacillus plantarum strains. Linezolid showed decreased activity (MIC > 4 microg/ml) against C. ramosum, two strains of C. difficile, and 15 strains of Lactobacillus spp. Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. The MICs of ampicillin for eight Clostridium spp. and three strains of L. casei were >1 microg/ml. The MIC(90) of TD-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. TD-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.
TI  - A PCR assay for detection of acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria in acidic  food products.
AB  - A PCR assay for the detection of acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria in the genera of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus was developed in this study. Primers targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were newly designed and used in this PCR assay. To determine the specificity of the assay, 56 different bacterial strains (of 33 genera), 2 fungi, 3 animals, and 4 plants were tested. Results were positive for most tested bacterial members of 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic groups (classified in the Lactobacillus casei and Pediococcus group), including Lactobacillus fructivorans, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus paracasei. For all other bacterial strains and eukaryote tested, results were negative. Bacterial DNA for PCR was prepared with a simple procedure with the use of Chelex 100 resin from culture after growth in deMan Rogosa Sharpe broth (pH 6.0). To test this PCR assay for the monitoring of the acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria, L. fructivorans was inoculated into several acidic food as an indicator. Before the PCR, the inoculation of 10 to 50 CFU of bacteria per g of food was followed by a 28-h enrichment culture step, and the PCR assay allowed the detection of bacterial cells. Including the enrichment culture step, the entire PCR detection process can be completed within 30 h.
TI  - Use of folic acid casei medium reveals trimethoprim susceptibility of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - AIM: Lactobacilli have been reported to have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. The susceptibility of lactobacilli to trimethoprim on different media was investigated in order to search for a phenotypic test method that could indicate the presence of acquired resistance genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum were susceptibility tested with E-tests on folic acid casei medium (FACM), MRS and defined medium 1. The effects of addition or removal of nucleosides and thymidine phosphorylase were investigated. E-tests on FACM yielded reproducible minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for trimethoprim but addition of nucleosides was necessary for growth of Lact. acidophilus. MICs for the tested strains were 0.125-0.19, 0.25-3 and 0.064-0.19 microg ml(-1) for Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum, respectively. With the addition of deoxyuridine and deoxyadenosine to FACM the MICs of Lact. acidophilus were 0.064-1 microg ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactobacilli do not have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. The results show that trimethoprim susceptibility testing of the tested Lactobacillus species is possible and indicate that transferable resistance genes are absent in all the tested strains.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei, dominant species in naturally fermented Sicilian green olives.
AB  - This study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria in naturally fermented green olives, collected from different areas of Sicily. Both classical biochemical tests and PCR/Restriction Fragments Length Polymorphism (RFLP) of 16S rDNA were used to characterize the isolates. The identity of the isolates was obtained by the partial sequencing analysis of the 16S rDNA. The BioMerieux software assigned the 13 heterofermentative strains to the Lactobacillus brevis species; 24 homofermentative strains were classified as Lactobacillus casei and the remaining 11 homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum. The rapid ID 32 STREP test identified coccal-shaped strains as Enterococcus faecium species. The PCR/RFLP analysis showed a remarkable bacterial heterogeneity within the isolates. The 16S rDNA partial sequencing did not confirm biochemical identification, revealing a strong dominance of isolates belonging to the L. casei species. It is noteworthy that this species has never been reported as dominant species in fermented vegetables.A combination of molecular and biochemical analysis allowed the identification of species involved in natural food fermentations.
TI  - Antagonistic interactions among Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB  - Microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. The aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and Lactobacillus casei, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum isolated from saliva. Different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain, alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double layer method; and (d) OD(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of Lactobacillus strains in LAPTg broth with different volumes of F. nucleatum supernatant. P. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus growth, except for L. casei, when the double plaque method was used. F. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all Lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. F. nucleatum inhibited L. casei growth whatever the method used. The substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. None of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of P. intermedia or F. nucleatum.
TI  - The effects of using lactic acid bacteria inoculants in maize silage on the formation of biogenic amines.
AB  - Silages from five ripened varieties of silage maize with dry matter contents ranging between 275 and 410 g/kg were prepared in five laboratory experiments. Whole-plant maize was fermented at 22 degrees C and silages were then stored at the same temperature for 4 months. Spontaneously fermented silages were prepared as control variants and compared with silages inoculated with commercial strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobzcillus buchneri and a mixed preparation Microsil containing L. plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The starter cultures were applied at doses 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6) CFU/g of chopped maize. Seven biogenic amines and polyamines were extracted from silages with perchloric acid and determined as N-benzamides by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. Common chemical criteria of silage quality were also determined. All three inoculants, mainly at the higher dose, decreased significantly contents of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine, three undesirable amines occurring at the highest levels. L. plantarum was the most effective. Contents of histamine and tryptamine were low in all experimental silages. Also relatively low were levels of polyamines spermidine and mainly of spermine.
TI  - Role of peptidoglycan subtypes in the pathogenesis of bacterial cell wall arthritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial cell wall (CW) arthritis develops in susceptible strains of rats after a single intraperitoneal injection of the CW from certain bacterial species, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic. For the development of chronic bacterial CW arthritis, the structure of the bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) has been found to be decisive. OBJECTIVE: To define the role of PG subtypes in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial CW arthritis. METHOD: Arthritis was induced with CWs of Lactobacillus plantarum, L casei B, L casei C, and L fermentum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the presence of CW derived muramic acid in the liver and to determine PG subtypes. CWs were also tested for their resistance to lysozyme in vitro. RESULTS: These results and those published previously indicate that PGs of CWs which induce chronic arthritis, no matter whether they were derived from strains of Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, or Lactobacillus, all have lysine as the third amino acid of the PG stem peptide, representing PG subtypes A3alpha and A4alpha. Those strains which induce only transient acute arthritis or no arthritis at all do not have lysine in this position, resulting in different PG subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo degradation of only those PGs with the subtypes A3alpha and A4alpha leads to the occurrence of large CW fragments, which persist in tissue and have good proinflammatory ability. CWs with other PG subtypes, even if they are lysozyme resistant, do not cause chronic arthritis, because the released fragments are not phlogistic. It is emphasised that a variety of microbial components not causing inflammation have been found in animal and human synovial tissue.
TI  - Binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ECM) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECM molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. Porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. Strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota and L. johnsonii La1) as well as by L. casei L.c., Lactobacillus sp. 2I3 and by L. plantarum LP. The other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. Strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. Bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Some animal strains (at least L. casei L.c. and Lactobacillus sp. 2I3) are comparable with the commercially used strains with respect to their ECM binding ability. As this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.
TI  - Characterization of a theta-type plasmid from Lactobacillus sakei: a potential basis for low-copy-number vectors in lactobacilli.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the 13-kb plasmid pRV500, isolated from Lactobacillus sakei RV332, was determined. Sequence analysis enabled the identification of genes coding for a putative type I restriction-modification system, two genes coding for putative recombinases of the integrase family, and a region likely involved in replication. The structural features of this region, comprising a putative ori segment containing 11- and 22-bp repeats and a repA gene coding for a putative initiator protein, indicated that pRV500 belongs to the pUCL287 subfamily of theta-type replicons. A 3.7-kb fragment encompassing this region was fused to an Escherichia coli replicon to produce the shuttle vector pRV566 and was observed to be functional in L. sakei for plasmid replication. The L. sakei replicon alone could not support replication in E. coli. Plasmid pRV500 and its derivative pRV566 were determined to be at very low copy numbers in L. sakei. pRV566 was maintained at a reasonable rate over 20 generations in several lactobacilli, such as Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus plantarum, in addition to L. sakei, making it an interesting basis for developing vectors. Sequence relationships with other plasmids are described and discussed.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  - There are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. In this study, Lactobacillus strains (L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. casei and L. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, C2BBe1. While the adhesion and colonization of EHEC was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of EHEC into the cell line was markedly suppressed by L. rhamnosus, though not by others. Concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of EHEC and host cell were not affected by the presence of L. rhamnosus. Simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on EHEC internalization was strictly dependent on viable L. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed L. rhamnosus. The fact that L. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between L. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of EHEC.
TI  - Mode of action of lactocin 705, a two-component bacteriocin from Lactobacillus casei CRL705.
AB  - Lactocin 705 is a bacteriocin whose activity depends on the complementary action  of two peptides (705alpha and 705beta) of 33-amino-acid residues each and is produced by Lactobacillus casei CRL705. Biologically active, synthetic lactocin 705 was used to study the mode of action on sensitive cells of Lactobacillus plantarum CRL691. The addition of 90 nmol l(-1) of lactocin 705 to cells of L. plantarum dissipated both, the membrane potential (DeltaPsi) and the pH gradient (DeltapH). Energized membrane, obtained after the addition of glucose, were more susceptible to lactocin 705 action leading to the immediate release of intracellular K(+) and inorganic phosphate. When the role of various ions on sensitive cells were analyzed, only Ca(2+) ion exhibited a protective effect against lactocin 705. These data suggest that the presence of a proton motive force (PMF) promotes the interaction of the bacteriocin with the cytoplasmic membrane of energized cells, leading to pore formation which allows for the efflux of ions, thereby ensuring efficient killing of target bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Probiotics and the urologist.
AB  - Emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. The proper definition of probiotics is important "Live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host", for several reasons. It rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. Guidelines, prepared by the United Nations and World Health Organization are now available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. In urology, the most studied strains are Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum B-54 and RC-14. Their use daily in oral form, or once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. Organisms such as Oxalobacter formigenes, still in the R&D phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. Some studies using L. casei Shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using L. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. In short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.
TI  - Extent of genetic lesions of the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways in Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paraplantarum, L. pentosus, and L. casei: prevalence of CO(2)-dependent auxotrophs and characterization of deficient arg genes in L. plantarum.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria require rich media since, due to mutations in their biosynthetic genes, they are unable to synthesize numerous amino acids and nucleobases. Arginine biosynthesis and pyrimidine biosynthesis have a common intermediate, carbamoyl phosphate (CP), whose synthesis requires CO(2). We investigated the extent of genetic lesions in both the arginine biosynthesis and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways in a collection of lactobacilli, including 150 strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, 32 strains of L. pentosus, 15 strains of L. paraplantarum, and 10 strains of L. casei. The distribution of prototroph and auxotroph phenotypes varied between species. All L. casei strains, no L. paraplantarum strains, two L. pentosus strains, and seven L. plantarum strains required arginine for growth. Arginine auxotrophs were more frequently found in L. plantarum isolated from milk products than in L. plantarum isolated from fermented plant products or humans; association with dairy products might favor arginine auxotrophy. In L. plantarum the argCJBDF genes were functional in most strains, and when they were inactive, only one gene was mutated in more than one-half of the arginine auxotrophs. Random mutation may have generated these auxotrophs since different arg genes were inactivated (there were single point mutations in three auxotrophs and nonrevertible genetic lesions in four auxotrophs). These data support the hypothesis that lactic acid bacteria evolve by progressively loosing unnecessary genes upon adaptation to specific habitats, with genome evolution towards cumulative DNA degeneration. Although auxotrophy for only uracil was found in one L. pentosus strain, a high CO(2) requirement (HCR) for arginine and pyrimidine was common; it was found in 74 of 207 Lactobacillus strains tested. These HCR auxotrophs may have had their CP cellular pool-related genes altered or deregulated.
TI  - Sequence and analysis of pBM02, a novel RCR cryptic plasmid from Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris P8-2-47.
AB  - This paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3.85 kbp plasmid pBM02 from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris P8-2-47. Analysis of the sequence predicted six ORFs larger than 25 amino acids. They all were transcribed from the same strand and organized in two functional cassettes: the replication region and a putative mobilization region. In the replication region, two ORFs specifying proteins homologous to others found in some classes of rolling circle-replicating plasmids were encountered (copG and repB). In fact, single-stranded DNA was detected as a replication intermediate of pBM02. copG and repB, together with some upstream sequences, formed part of the minimal replication unit of the plasmid. Interestingly, pBM02 shared a 212 bp stretch with plasmids of the pWV01 type, in which the whole single-strand origin of replication is included. In the mobilization region, an ORF coding for a mobilization-like protein was present, preceded by a putative oriT sequence homologous to that of plasmid pMV158. The replicon of pBM02 is of the wide-host range type, and functions in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lectin-like binding of lactobacilli considered for their use in probiotical preparations for animal use.
AB  - Three gut lactobacilli from piglets (Lactobacillus plantarum L 5, Lactobacillus paracasei L 81, Lactobacillus fermentum L 670) and Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum L.c.) from a calf were examined by microtitre plate binding assay for their lectin-like binding activity after their cultivation on Rogosa agar and in MRS broth. Three ECM (extracellular matrix) molecules (fetuin, porcine fibronectin and porcine mucin) were selected for this assay. Additionally, the effect of heparin on the binding of these three ECM molecules by Lactobacillus strains in microtitre plates was tested. Moreover, haemagglutination tests with pig, cattle, sheep, and hen erythrocytes were performed. However, none of the four Lactobacillus strains examined did react with any of the erythrocytes tested. The differences between individual strains were observed in their binding to immobilised ECM molecules. The best adherent was the Lactobacillus plantarum L5, however, the other three strains showed also good ECM binding. With regard to an influence of cultivation medium on lectin-like binding activity, binding of all ECM molecules was expressed in Lactobacillus paracasei L 81 to significantly higher degree (P < 0.001) after cultivation on Rogosa agar than in MRS broth. Similarly, strains Lactobacillus fermentum L 670 and Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum L.c. displayed significantly higher (P < 0.001) binding of fibronectin and mucin after growth on Rogosa agar in comparison with MRS broth cultivation. However, no significant (on fetuin and fibronectin binding) or opposite effect (on mucin binding) of cultivation medium was observed in Lactobacillus plantarum L 5 strain. The influence of cultivation medium on fetuin binding by Lactobacillus fermentum L 670 was also not significant while Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum L.c. bound fetuin significantly better (P < 0.01) after growth on Rogosa agar. Heparin pretreatment increased the binding of the ECM molecules by the Lactobacillus fermentum L 670 strain significantly (P < 0.001 or P < 0.05) with the exception of porcine fibronectin when the strain was cultivated in MRS broth. This result is important especially in the connection with the previous observations that heparin decreased ECM binding of enteropathogens as staphylococci or clinical enterococcal isolates. Following up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results indicate that the selected lactobacilli are probably suitable for probiotic purposes.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in SOS-chromotest.
AB  - Antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using SOS-Chromotest. The supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4-NQO on the tester organism Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ). High genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: Lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; L. plantarum, 93.3%; L. rhamnosus, 93.4%; L. acidophilus, 90.9%; L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and Bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; Strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in L. casei and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Cell exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. The active strains survived at 0.1 mM 4-NQO exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (pH 2.0) and adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes. Antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-NQO absorbance profile.
TI  - Differential roles of the two-component peptides of lactocin 705 in antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei CRL705 produces a class IIb bacteriocin, lactocin 705, which  relies on the complementary action of two components, Lac705alpha and Lac705beta. These peptides exert a bactericidal effect on the indicator strain Lactobacillus plantarum CRL691, with an optimal Lac705alpha/Lac705beta peptide ratio of 1 to 4. Electron microscopy studies showed that treated CRL691 cells have their cell wall severely damaged, with mesosome-like membranous formations protruding into their cytoplasm. Although less pronounced, a similar effect was also observed with the Lac705beta peptide alone. Furthermore, Lac705beta increased the inhibitory action of a diluted supernatant of L. casei CRL705, while Lac705alpha protected CRL691 cells from inhibition. Both peptides were required to dissipate the proton motive force (Deltapsi and DeltapH) of CRL691 cells. These data suggested that of the two components of lactocin 705, the Lac705alpha peptide is responsible for receptor recognition, and the Lac705beta peptide is the active component on the cell membrane of CRL691 cells.
TI  - Esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  - In the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. Esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. The lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. By studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. Lactobacillus plantarum O236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. Lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. The intracellular and extracellular fractions of Leuconostoc mesenteroides O257, Lactobacillus plantarum O236, and Lactobacillus acidophilus O177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. L. plantarum O186, L. acidophilus O252, Enterococcus faecium O174 and O426, and Enterococcus faecalis Ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. Lactococcus lactis O233, L. plantarum O155, and Lactobacillus casei O190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. Not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. Esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. Wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.
TI  - Effect of probiotic fermentation on antinutrients and in vitro protein and starch digestibilities of indigenously developed RWGT food mixture.
AB  - Indigenously developed RWGT food mixture which contained rice flour, whey, sprouted green gram paste and tomato pulp (2:1:1:1 w/w) was autoclaved 1.5 kg/cm2, 15 min, 121 degrees C), cooled and fermented with 2% liquid culture (containing 10(6) cells/ml broth). Two types of fermentations were carried out i.e. single culture fermentation [L. casei, L. plantarum (37 degrees C, 24 hr.)] and sequential culture fermentation [S. boulardii (25 degrees C, 24 hr.) + L. casei (37 degrees C, 24 hr.)]; S. boulardii [(25 degrees C, 24 hr.) + L. plantarum (37 degrees C, 24 hr.)]. All the fermentations drastically reduced the contents of phytic acid, polyphenols and trypsin inhibitor activity while significantly improving the in vitro digestibilities of starch and protein. Sequential culture fermentations brought about higher changes as compared to single culture fermentations.
TI  - Screening and selection of Lactobacillus strains for use as adjunct cultures in production of semi-hard cheese.
AB  - Thirty-three Lactobacillus strains were tested as adjuncts in a cheese model system. Eighteen strains originated from cheese (nine Lactobacillus spp. and nine Lb. paracasei/casei) and 15 from human intestinal mucosa (11 Lb. rhamnosus; three Lb. paracasei; one Lb. plantarum). Model cheeses weighing 120 g were made of cheese grains from full-scale production of washed curd semi-hard cheese (Herrgard). The model system was reproducible and similar to full-scale production with respect to moisture, salt content, pH and microbial flora. The model cheeses were sampled for aerobic and anaerobic plate count and viable counts of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. The presence of adjuncts in the model cheeses was confirmed by typing isolates with Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The sensory properties of model cheeses were described. In a first trial 23 of the 33 adjuncts were re-isolated from the corresponding model cheeses after 9 or 13 weeks. Adjuncts of Lb. paracasei were re-isolated more frequently than adjuncts of Lb. rhamnosus. Nine strains were selected, on the basis of their ability to grow and be a dominating part of the microflora of model cheese with interesting sensory properties. These strains were further studied together with two commercial cultures. The sensory influences on model cheeses of six of the adjuncts were confirmed, and flavour scores were in the range of 2.9-7.1 for model cheeses with different adjuncts while the control had a flavour score of 5.6 (0-10 scale). Survival and growth of seven out of the nine strains correlated with the results of the first trial. Growth and influence on flavour of four adjunct cultures were confirmed in experimental cheese manufactured in a 400-1 open vat.
TI  - The evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  - The effectiveness of yeast extracts (YE) and potato extracts (PE) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (AS). Two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using ODmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) Eleven lots from the same PE-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. The ODmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. The growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% PE than in base medium containing 100% YE for both ODmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in PE. In AS assays, highest OD values for Lactobacillus casei EQ28, Lactobacillus rhamnosus R-011, Lactobacillus plantarum EQ12, and Streptococcus thermophilus R-083 were obtained with a mixture of PE and YE. Fermentations (2 L) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of AS to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. In these fermentations, replacement of 50% YE with PE was shown to enable good growth of S. thermophilus. With L. rhamnosus R-011, a high correlation (R2 = 0.95) was found between ODmax data obtained in the AS assays and that of the 2-L bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. However, AS was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. The relationship was still good for ODmax between AS data and that of the bioreactor data with L. rhamnosus R-011 in industrial LBS medium (R2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the S. thermophilus R-083 on Rosell #43 industrial medium (R2 = 0.33). Since PE cost 40% less than YE, there are strong economic advantages in considering such a partial replacement of YE by PE.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Efficient protoplast regeneration for some homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  - Conditions for protoplast regeneration were examined for several strains of homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci isolated from silage. Attempts to regenerate protoplasts using previously published agar regeneration media for lactobacilli were unsuccessful for most of the strains. Replacing or increasing colloidal substances in a medium containing raffinose and MgCl(2) as osmotic stabilizers enabled efficient regeneration of the protoplasts at a frequency of 10-99%. A medium containing gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and no agar was effective for Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus protoplasts. An agar medium containing PVP (PVP medium) was effective for Pediococcus sp. protoplasts, and addition of agarose to the PVP medium enabled regeneration of Lactobacillus casei protoplasts. A medium containing calcium alginate gel and no agar was effective for Lactobacillus curvatus protoplasts. The type of colloidal substance required for protoplast regeneration varied from species to species. This result suggested that several kinds of media may be necessary to regenerate protoplasts for all the genera of lactobacilli and pediococci.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum initiate catabolism of methionine by transamination.
AB  - AIMS: To study the ability of Lactobacillus casei and Lact. plantarum strains to  convert methonine to cheese flavour compounds. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains were assayed for methionine aminotransferase and lyase activities, and amino acid decarboxylase activity. About 25% of the strains assayed showed methionine aminotransferase activity. The presence of glucose in the reaction mixture increased conversion of methionine to 4-methylthio-2-ketobutanoate (KMBA) and 4-methylthio-2-hydroxybutanoate (HMBA) in all strains. The methionine aminotransferase activity in Lact. plantarum and Lact. casei showed variable specificity for the amino group acceptors glyoxylate, ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvate. None of the strains showed methionine lyase or glutamate and methionine decarboxylase activities. CONCLUSION: The presence of amino acid converting enzymes in lactobacilli is strain specific. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this work suggest that lactobacilli can be used as adjuncts for flavour formation in cheese manufacture.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic Lactobacillus casei in a murine model of Escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against Escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model was examined. UTI was induced by intraurethral administration of Escherichia coli strain HU-1 (a clinical isolate from a UTI patient, positive for type 1 and P fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) CFU in 20 microl of saline, into a C3H/HeN mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 N HCl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 N NaOH 24 h before the challenge infection. Chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) CFU in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. A single administration of L. casei Shirota at a dose of 10(8) CFU 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited E. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. Multiple daily treatments with L. casei Shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity in this UTI model. A heat-killed preparation of L. casei Shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. The other Lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., L. fermentum ATCC 14931(T), L. jensenii ATCC 25258(T), L. plantarum ATCC 14917(T), and L. reuteri JCM 1112(T), had no significant antimicrobial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic L. casei strain Shirota is a potent therapeutic agent for UTI.
TI  - Characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from Italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  - Non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) were isolated from 12 Italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. A total of 400 presumptive Lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. Phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% Lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% L. brevis isolates, 12% L. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9% L. curvatus isolates, 6% L. fermentum isolates, 6% L. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% L. pentosus isolates, 3% L. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% L. rhamnosus isolates. Eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. Although a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific DNA band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. In contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by UPGMA were species specific and resolved the NSLAB. The only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as L. plantarum and L. pentosus or as L. casei subsp. casei and L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. Based on protein profiles, Italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. In general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized milk. The same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different RAPD clusters.
TI  - Characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest Argentina.
AB  - Indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest Argentina. Mean growth counts on M17, MRS, and MSE agar media did not show significant differences (P < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. Isolates of lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as Enterococcus (48%), lactococci (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). All lactococci were identified as Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). Lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). Enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. L. plantarum (93%), L. acidophilus (5%), and Lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers. L. plantarum and L. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. The majority of the lactobacilli and Lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. Enzyme activities (API-ZYM tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of L. plantarum strains were considerably higher. The predominance of L. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total DNA extraction and purification procedure and PCR amplification of 16S rDNA for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. Thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. These partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database of NCBI. The identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. This analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus suis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. casei, Lact. alimentarium, and Lact. delbruekii and Clostridium sp. Two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. Unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. Use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Rapid PCR-based procedure to identify lactic acid bacteria: application to six common Lactobacillus species.
AB  - The goal of this study was to develop a method allowing rapid identification of the lactic acid bacteria strains in use in the laboratory (Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB8826; L. fermentum KLD; L. reuteri 100-23; L. salivarius UCC43321; L. paracasei LbTGS1.4; L. casei ATCC393), based on PCR amplification of 16S RNA coding sequences. First, specific forward oligonucleotides were designed in the variable regions of 16S RNA coding sequences of six Lactobacillus strains. The reverse oligonucleotide was designed in the region where the sequences were homologous for the six strains. The expected size of the amplification product was +/-1000 bp. The specificity of the method was tested on total chromosomal DNA. For five out of the six strains, the amplification of the fragment was strain-specific and the method was directly applicable to colonies. For the strain L. casei ATCC393, an additional argument to the classification of this bacteria in the paracasei group could be proposed. Validation of the developed method was performed by applying it to six Lactobacillus reference strains and to various species of bacteria.
TI  - Reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the US. Ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. We studied the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium and a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. Following oral inoculation with 10(10)CFU of E. coli O157:H7, 30 Suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. The lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with L. acidophilus or with S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum. The microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)CFU per kilogram of diet. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for E. coli O157:H7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC) as a selective media. E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by its reaction with O157 and H7 antisera. E. coli O157:H7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. However, lambs administered a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum shed significantly lower (P=0.0211) average number of E. coli O157:H7 (2.3log(10)CFU per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. S. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (P=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of L. acidophulus and S. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)CFU per gram of feces) but significantly lower (P=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)CFU per gram of feces) and those supplemented with L. acidophilus (5.5log(10)CFU per gram of feces). Average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were significantly improved (P=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for L. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for S. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for L. acidophulus and S. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum supplemented lambs. The study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with E. coli O157:H7 with S. faecium or a mixture of S. faecium, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of E. coli O157:H7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.
TI  - Evaluation of numerical analyses of RAPD and API 50 CH patterns to differentiate  Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. fermentum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. sake, Lact. parabuchneri, Lact. gallinarum, Lact. casei, Weissella minor and related taxa isolated from kocho and tef.
AB  - AIM: The study was carried out to assess the agreement of API 50 CH fermentation  data of food lactobacilli with their RAPD profiles to determine whether the system could be used alone as a reliable taxonomic tool for this genus. METHODS AND RESULTS: API 50 CH, RAPD and DNA:DNA reassociation data for 42 lactobacilli from tef and kocho were compared with 30 type strains. Discrepancies were observed between the three methods in assigning strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. fermentum, Weissella minor and Lact. gallinarum, and Lact. fermentum, Lact. amylophilus, Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and Lact. rhamnosus. DNA reassociation data agreed well with RAPD results. CONCLUSIONS: API 50 CH profiles should be complemented with molecular genetic results for effective identification in Lactobacillus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study suggested less dependability of metabolic data alone as an identification tool.
TI  - [Obtaining a fermented chickpea extract (Cicer arietinum L.) and its use as a milk extensor].
AB  - Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) is cultivated in the North part of Mexico and it is  considered a good source of vegetal protein of low cost (20% average), nevertheless, the 80% used for the exportation and only the 20% less was used for animal feeding. The main objective in this study is to obtain a fermented chickpea extract for using in dairy extensor. Chickpea water absorbtion kinetics were carried out in e temperature conditions:while the conditions were established, chickpea was grounded and fermented in different amounts with its natural flora, L. casei, L. plantarum and a mixture culture of both microorganism in logarithmic phase. The results showed that the presence of microorganism of chickpea natural flora interferes during the fermentation, so before the inoculation it was necessary treat the chickpea extract (CE) terminally in a dilution 1:4 during 20 min at 7.7 kg/cm2 of pressure. The use of a mixture culture of 5% of L. casei and 5% L. plantarum inoculated in MRS broth was used to decrease fermentation time. Its addition in logarithmic phase to the sterile chickpea extract increased the lactic acid production and decreased the pH value in 6 h which was less time that one obtained with each of lactobacillus. The fermented extract obtained finally, presented similar sensory characteristics to the ones of dairy products. Therefore, chickpea is a good alternative as a extensor for this kind of products.
TI  - Microbial community dynamics during production of the Mexican fermented maize dough pozol.
AB  - The dynamics of the microbial community responsible for the traditional fermentation of maize in the production of Mexican pozol was investigated by using a polyphasic approach combining (i) microbial enumerations with culture media, (ii) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of total community DNA with bacterial and eukaryotic primers and sequencing of partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, (iii) quantification of rRNAs from dominant microbial taxa by using phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, and (iv) analysis of sugars and fermentation products. A Streptococcus species dominated the fermentation and accounted for between 25 and 75% of the total flora throughout the process. Results also showed that the initial epiphytic aerobic microflora was replaced in the first 2 days by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including a close relative of Lactobacillus fermentum, producing lactic acid and ethanol; this heterolactic flora was then progressively replaced by homofermentative LAB (mainly close relatives of L. plantarum, L. casei, and L. delbrueckii) which continued acidification of the maize dough. At the same time, a very diverse community of yeasts and fungi developed, mainly at the periphery of the dough. The analysis of the DGGE patterns obtained with bacterial and eukaryotic primers targeting the 16S and 18S rDNA genes clearly demonstrated that there was a major shift in the community structure after 24 h and that high biodiversity-according to the Shannon-Weaver index-was maintained throughout the process. These results proved that a relatively high number of species, at least six to eight, are needed to perform this traditional lactic acid fermentation. The presence of Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and enterobacteria suggests a fecal origin of some important pozol microorganisms. Overall, the results obtained with different culture-dependent or -independent techniques clearly confirmed the importance of developing a polyphasic approach to study the ecology of fermented foods.
TI  - Molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria from cassava sour starch (Colombia).
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria and more particularly lactobacilli and Leuconostoc, are widely found in a wide variety of traditional fermented foods of tropical countries, made with cereals, tubers, meat or fish. These products represent a source of bacterial diversity that cannot be accurately analysed using classical phenotypic and biochemical tests. In the present work, the identification and the molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cassava sour starch fermentation were assessed by using a combination of complementary molecular methods: Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA fingerprinting (RAPD), plasmid profiling, hybridization using rRNA phylogenetic probes and partial 16S rDNA sequencing. The results revealed a large diversity of bacterial species (Lb. manihotivorans, Lb. plantarum, Lb. casei, Lb. hilgardii, Lb. buchneri, Lb. fermentum, Ln. mesenteroides and Pediococcus sp.). However, the most frequently isolated species were Lb. plantarum and Lb. manihotivorans. The RAPD analysis revealed a large molecular diversity between Lb. manihotivorans or Lb. plantarum strains. These results, observed on a rather limited number of samples, reveal that significant bacterial diversity is generated in traditional cassava sour starch fermentations. We propose that the presence of the amylolytic Lb. manihotivorans strains could have a role in sour starch processing.
TI  - Engineering the microflora to vaccinate the mucosa: serum immunoglobulin G responses and activated draining cervical lymph nodes following mucosal application of tetanus toxin fragment C-expressing lactobacilli.
AB  - The delivery of antigens to mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues in paediatric and immunocompromised populations by safe, non-invasive vectors, such as commensal lactobacilli, represents a crucial improvement to prevailing vaccination options. In this report, we describe the oral and nasal immunization of mice with vaccines constructed through an original system for heterologous gene expression in Lactobacillus in which the 50 000-molecular weight (MW) fragment C of tetanus toxin (TTFC) is expressed either as an intracellular or a surface-exposed protein. Our data indicate that L. plantarum is more effective in this respect than L. casei and that, under the experimental conditions investigated, delivery of TTFC expressed as an intracellular antigen is more effective than cell-surface expression. Immunization of mice with live recombinant lactobacilli induced significant levels of circulating TTFC-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) following nasal or oral delivery of vaccine strains. In addition, following nasal delivery, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) was induced in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, as were antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells and antigen-specific T-cell activation in draining lymph nodes, substantiating their potential for safe mucosal delivery of paediatric vaccines.
TI  - [Cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The possibility of using the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. The prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mRNA, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). To prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. High copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in L. plantarum and L. pentosus strains. Several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. Genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from Staphylococcus aureus plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. The vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. But the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. L. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. In addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.
TI  - Identification and nucleotide sequence of genes involved in the synthesis of lactocin 705, a two-peptide bacteriocin from Lactobacillus casei CRL 705.
AB  - The structural gene determinants of lactocin 705, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus casei CRL 705, have been amplified from a plasmid of approximately 35 kb and sequenced. Lactocin 705 is a class IIb bacteriocin, whose activity depends upon the complementation of two peptides (705alpha and 705beta) of 33 amino acid residues each. These peptides are synthesized as precursors with signal sequences of the double-glycine type, which exhibited high identities with the leader peptides of plantaricin S and J from Lactobacillus plantarum, brochocin C from Brochotrix campestris, sakacin P from Lactobacillus sake, and the competence stimulating peptides from Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mitis. However, the two mature bacteriocins 705alpha and 705beta do not show significant similarity to other sequences in the databases.
TI  - Development of a rapid method for the identification of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented italian sausages using a polymerase chain reaction-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - A rapid method for the identification of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented Italian sausages was developed. It is based on the amplification of a small fragment from the 16S rRNA gene followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). Lactobacillus sakei, L. curvatus, L. alimentarius, L. casei, L. plantarum and L. brevis, obtained from International Collections, were used to optimize the method. Thiry-nine strains of Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from naturally fermented sausages and, after traditional identification, were tested by the PCR-TGGE protocol developed. No differences were observed comparing the results obtained, apart from five strains identified as L. curvatus that showed a PCR-TGGE profile identical to L. sakei.
TI  - Identification and characterization of Enterococcus species isolated from forage  crops and their influence on silage fermentation.
AB  - Forty-eight strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from forage crops, and  their identification, characterization and influence on silage fermentation were studied. All isolates were Gram-positive, short-chain-forming, catalase-negative, and facultatively anaerobic cocci that did not produce gas from glucose, only formed L-lactic acid, and were able to grow at pH 9.6%, in 6.5% NaCl, or with 40% bile, but not below pH 4.5. These isolates were commonly isolated from forage crops, and they were divided into four groups (A, B, C, and D) according to sugar fermentation characteristics. Selected strains of FA 5, FA 27, FA 45, and FA 57 were identified as Enterococcus hirae, E. faecalis, E. casseliflavus, and E. mundtii, respectively, on the basis of DNA-DNA homology, Strains FA 5, FA 27, FA 45, and FA 57 and two strains from commercial inoculants, LC 10 (Lactobacillus casei) and LP 15 (L. plantarum), were used as additives to alfalfa and guinea grass silages. Alphalfa and guinea grass silages inoculated with LC 10, LP 15, FA 5 + LC 10, and FA 5 + LP 15-treatments in alfalfa and guinea grass silages had significantly lower pH values, contents of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen, gas production, and dry matter losses compared with the control silage after 60 d of fermentation. However, the E. hirae FA 5, E. faecalis FA 27, E. casseliflavus FA 45, and E. mundtii FA 57-inoculated silages gave similar values to the control in both types of silage. The FA 27 + LC 10 and FA 27 + LP 15-inoculated silages did not differ in fermentation quality from LC 10 and LP 15-inoculated silages alone. The results confirmed that Enterococcus species were not able to improve silage quality.
TI  - Collagen (Cn-I) binding by gut lactobacilli.
AB  - Four gut Lactobacillus strains displaying the features which make them particularly promising for the preparation of probiotic products were investigated together with 5 fresh isolates and one collection strain of Lactobacillus plantarum for their ability to bind type I collagen (Cn-I). Immobilised Cn-I in microtitre plates was bound only by 3 strains of gut lactobacilli from piglets and the collection strain Lactobacillus plantarum LHI 10 from Prague in range of A570nm readings 0.114-0.221. Six strains (isolates from turkeys and a calf) did not bind Cn-I (A570nm < 0.1) in this assay. An influence of cultivation medium on Cn-I binding was significant (P < 0.001) in all four adherent strains. Significantly higher (P < 0.001) binding of Cn-I was observed for Lactobacillus casei L 81 and Lactobacillus plantarum LHI 10 grown on solid medium (MRS agar) than for MRS broth-grown cells, however, Lactobacillus plantarum L 5 and Lactobacillus fermentum L 435 expressed significantly (P < 0.001) higher Cn-I binding during cultivation in MRS broth. The specificity of the binding was confirmed because the Cn-I binding by lactobacilli after their preincubation with this protein was completely abolished. Three selected inhibitors (fucoidan, heparan sulphate and hyaluronic acid) significantly (P < 0.001) reduced Cn-I binding by the Lactobacillus plantarum L 5 strain. Following up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results suggest that the selected piglets lactobacilli are also able to bind Cn-I and therefore should antagonize collagen niche colonization by various enteropathogens when used for probiotic purposes.
TI  - Transport of D-xylose in Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus plantarum: evidence for a mechanism of facilitated diffusion via the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - We have identified and characterized the D-xylose transport system of Lactobacillus pentosus. Uptake of D-xylose was not driven by the proton motive force generated by malolactic fermentation and required D-xylose metabolism. The kinetics of D-xylose transport were indicative of a low-affinity facilitated-diffusion system with an apparent K(m) of 8.5 mM and a V(max) of 23 nmol min(-1) mg of dry weight(-1). In two mutants of L. pentosus defective in the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system, growth on D-xylose was absent due to the lack of D-xylose transport. However, transport of the pentose was not totally abolished in a third mutant, which could be complemented after expression of the L. curvatus manB gene encoding the cytoplasmic EIIB(Man) component of the EII(Man) complex. The EII(Man) complex is also involved in D-xylose transport in L. casei ATCC 393 and L. plantarum 80. These two species could transport and metabolize D-xylose after transformation with plasmids which expressed the D-xylose-catabolizing genes of L. pentosus, xylAB. L. casei and L. plantarum mutants resistant to 2-deoxy-D-glucose were defective in EII(Man) activity and were unable to transport D-xylose when transformed with plasmids containing the xylAB genes. Finally, transport of D-xylose was found to be the rate-limiting step in the growth of L. pentosus and of L. plantarum and L. casei ATCC 393 containing plasmids coding for the D-xylose-catabolic enzymes, since the doubling time of these bacteria on D-xylose was proportional to the level of EII(Man) activity.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). They were identified as L. plantarum (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (1 strain), L. brevis (2 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. casei (1 strain), L. fermentum (1 strain) and L. acidophilus (1 strain). Bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii and L. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. The bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using Enterococcus faecalis as indicator. While catalase treatment, pH changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees C had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase K resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. A reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Brewing spoilage Lactobacilli detected using monoclonal antibodies to bacterial surface antigens.
AB  - A panel of thirteen monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) was assembled that reacts with surface antigens on eight of eleven Lactobacillus brewing spoilage organisms, including one or more of L. brevis, L. buchneri, L. casei-alactosus, L. plantarum, or unspeciated isolate(s). Immunoblotting was done to identify the antigens involved in Mab binding. Antigen stability in situ was tested by protease treatment and by surface antigen extraction of washed bacteria. Protease susceptibility of extracted surface antigens was also examined. In most cases, Lactobacillus surface antigens detected by the Mabs appear to be noncovalently bound proteins readily altered or removed from the bacterium by various environmental conditions. This research identifies brewing conditions that need to be tested to ascertain whether bacterial surface antigen-reactive Mabs can be used for the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of Lactobacillus brewing spoilage organisms.
TI  - Effect of applying lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage crops on fermentation characteristics and aerobic deterioration of silage.
AB  - Two selected strains, Lactobacillus casei FG 1 and Lactobacillus plantarum FG 10  that were isolated from forage crops were used as additives at 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh matter to alfalfa, Italian ryegrass, and sorghum, and their effect on fermentation characteristics and aerobic deterioration of silage was studied. The three silages treated with strains FG 1 or FG 10 were well preserved; had significantly lower pH values, butyric acid, propionic acid, and ammonia N concentrations, gas production, and dry matter losses; and had significantly higher contents of residual water-soluble carbohydrates and lactic acid than did the respective control silages. Yeast counts were high in all treated silages and increased rapidly during aerobic exposure. As a result, treated silages spoiled faster upon aerobic exposure than did the respective control silages. Most yeasts isolated from deteriorated silages showed high tolerance to lactic acid but low tolerance to butyric acid, and they were able to grow at low pH conditions and assimilate lactic acid. The results confirmed that L. casei and L. plantarum improved fermentation quality but did not inhibit the growth of silage yeast or aerobic deterioration of the silage.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria from chili bo, a Malaysian food ingredient.
AB  - Ninety-two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from a Malaysian food ingredient, chili bo, stored for up to 25 days at 28 degreesC with no benzoic acid (product A) or with 7,000 mg of benzoic acid kg-1 (product B). The strains were divided into eight groups by traditional phenotypic tests. A total of 43 strains were selected for comparison of their sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) whole-cell protein patterns with a SDS-PAGE database of LAB. Isolates from product A were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus farciminis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Enterococcus faecalis, and Weissella confusa. Five strains belonging to clusters which could not be allocated to existing species by SDS-PAGE were further identified by 16S rRNA sequence comparison. One strain was distantly related to the Lactobacillus casei/Pediococcus group. Two strains were related to Weissella at the genus or species level. Two other strains did not belong to any previously described 16S rRNA group of LAB and occupied an intermediate position between the L. casei/Pediococcus group and the Weissella group and species of Carnobacterium. The latter two strains belong to the cluster of LAB that predominated in product B. The incidence of new species and subspecies of LAB in chili bo indicate the high probability of isolation of new LAB from certain Southeast Asian foods. None of the isolates exhibited bacteriocin activity against L. plantarum ATCC 14917 and LMG 17682.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. The strains used in this study included Escherichia coli (FT 101), Streptococcus agalactiae (FT 311, FT 313, FT 315), Staphylococcus aureus (FT 192), Yersinia enterocolitica (FT 430), Salmonella infantis (FT 431), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (FT 432), Lactobacillus plantarum (FT234) and Lactobacillus casei (FT 232). Tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. Tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. A combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. It was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. The objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the toxic effects of the mycotoxins. The data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A and that this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 plus l-carnitine.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Lactobacillus community in traditional processing of Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The natural Lactobacillus community involved in traditional Mozzarella cheese production has been investigated. The bacterial associations of whey, curd before stretching and Mozzarella were analyzed using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to follow growth kinetics, and 16S rDNA sequencing to identify the taxonomical position of isolated strains. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the Lactobacillus community was composed of 13 different biotypes and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belong to L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. helveticus and L. casei subsp. casei. In addition, two strains of Weissella hellenica were isolated on selective media for lactobacilli. The four L. casei subsp. casei strains and W. hellenica contained sequences related to the prtP gene coding for proteinase, and the highest proteolytic activity in milk was found in one strain of L. casei subsp.casei.
TI  - Differentiation of Lactobacillus Species by Molecular Typing.
AB  - A total of 64 type, reference, clinical, health food, and stock isolates of microaerophilic Lactobacillus species were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Of particular interest were members of six of the eight species most commonly recovered from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women, namely, Lactobacillus jensenii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum. Six main groupings were identified on the basis of ribotyping. This technique was able to classify fresh isolates to the species level. In the case of the ribotype A grouping for L. rhamnosus, differences between strains were evident by chromosome typing (chromotyping). Many isolates did not possess plasmids. Six L. rhamnosus strains isolated from four different health food products appeared to be identical to L. rhamnosus ATCC 21052. The molecular typing system is useful for identifying and differentiating Lactobacillus isolates. Studies of strains of potential importance to the urogenital flora should include molecular characterization as a means of comparing genetic traits with those of strains whose characteristics associated with colonization and antagonism against pathogens have been defined.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus strains isolated from dryfermented sausages on muscle sarcoplasmic proteins.
AB  - The proteolytic activity of seven strains of Lactobacillus from two species isolated from dry cured sausages was assayed using a soluble muscle extract as a source of proteins, at a temperature of 30 degrees C. The results indicated that the strains of Lactobacillus plantarum tested had the more active proteolytic system, showing the highest amino acid release in the medium after 72 hr of incubation (L. plantarum CRL 681) when the microorganism was in the stationary phase of growth. The strains of L. casei showed a continued hydrolytic activity with a lower amino acids concentration along the studied period. The SDS-PAGE profiles showed that the major changes in sarcoplasmic proteins were produced in the 13 kDa and 36-40 kDa molecular weights region.
TI  - Identification and characterization of homofermentative mesophilic Lactobacillus  strains isolated from artisan starter-free cheeses.
AB  - Fifty-six strains of mesophilic lactobacilli from hand-made cheeses made without  starters have been isolated, identified and characterized. Of these, 21 strains were classified as Lactobacillus plantarum, 18 as Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum, 10 as Lact. curvatus, five as Lact. casei subsp. casei, and two remained unidentified. The numerical classification of these strains, based on 80 different physiological and morphological characteristics, correlated well with the phenotypic classification. Most of the technologically important traits have been examined in these strains, which will allow the selection of some of them to be tested as adjunct cultures in the manufacture of dairy products.
TI  - Effect of NaCl-tolerant lactic acid bacteria and NaCl on the fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of silage.
AB  - NaCl-tolerant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains LC-10 (Lactobacillus casei) and  LP-15 (Lact. plantarum) and NaCl were used as additives to sorghun (Sorghum bicolor). Numbers of LAB were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in all the additive-treated silages than in the control silage at an early stage of ensiling. During the fermentation process, addition of NaCl or LAB effectively inhibited the growth of aerobic bacteria and clostridia, but not yeasts. All the additive-treated silages had significantly (P < 0.05) lower pH, ammonia nitrogen content, dry matter loss and gas production but significantly (P < 0.05) higher lactic acid content and residual water soluble carbohydrates compared with the control silage. The improvement in silage quality was in the order: LAB > NaCl > control. Yeast counts were high in all additive-based silages and they increased during the exposure of the silages to air. As a result, these silages suffered aerobic deterioration, whereas the control silage was stable. The results confirmed that the NaCl or LAB improved fermentation quality but did not prevent aerobic deterioration of the silage.
TI  - Efficient secretion of the model antigen M6-gp41E in Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826.
AB  - Four Lactobacillus strains (Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826, Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4, Lb. casei ATCC 393 and Lb. fermentum KLD) were tested for their ability to produce and secrete heterologous proteins. These strains were first screened with an alpha-amylase reporter under the control of a set of expression or expression/secretion signals from various lactic acid bacteria. With most of the constructions tested, the level of extracellular production was highest in Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826, and lowest in Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4. These two strains were next assayed using a model antigen consisting of the N-terminal part of the M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes fused to the linear epitope ELDKWAS from human immunodeficiency virus gp41 protein. Secretion of this heterologous protein was inefficient in Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4, which accumulated a large intracellular pool of the unprocessed precursor, whereas Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826 was able to secrete the antigen to a level as high as 10 mg l-1.
TI  - [The antagonistic action of lactobacilli on Helicobacter pylori].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 9 strains of the genus Lactobacillus with respect to 25 H. pylori clinical cultures was studied with the use of the original method of ring blocks. The presence of high antagonistic activity of strains L. casei 925, L. plantarum 8 RA-3, L. fermentum BL-96 and L. 90265 was established. The newly developed method of the determination of antagonistic activity with respect to H. pylori, taking into account the biological features of this organism, was found to be convenient for work, precise and giving reproducible results.
TI  - Plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - Bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. During lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host chromosome at the 3' end of a tRNA(Ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (L. Dupont et al., J. Bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). A nonreplicative vector (pMC1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attP site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei (two strains), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Integrative recombination of pMC1 into the chromosomes of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pMC1 attP site. The isolation and sequencing of pMC1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pMC1 integrated into the conserved tRNA(Ser) gene. In the other bacterial species where this tRNA gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic DNA were used. A consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. The comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide CCT at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.
TI  - High level heterologous protein production in Lactococcus and Lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the Lactobacillus brevis S-layer signals.
AB  - A secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a S-layer  protein (SlpA) from Lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. E. coli beta-lactamase (Bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the S-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pGK12. In all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpA signals and all Bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. The Lb. brevis S-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in L. lactis, Lb. brevis and Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. gasseri the slpA promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in Lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. The production of Bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. The highest yield of Bla was obtained with L. lactis and Lb. brevis. Without pH control, substantial degradation of Bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) tested. When growing L. lactis and Lb. brevis under pH control, the Bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. L. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of Bla which to our knowledge represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by LAB so far. The short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) Bla molecules/cell per h. Such a high rate was also observed with Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpA gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of Bla production. The results obtained indicate wide applicability of the Lb. brevis slpA signals for efficient protein production and secretion in LAB.
TI  - Anti-aflatoxigenic activity of Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum 371 isolated from a silage inoculant was found to inhibit aflatoxins B1 and G1 biosynthesis by Aspergillus flavus subsp. parasiticus NRRI. 2999, in liquid medium. The inhibitory activity in the Lactobacillus cell-free supernatant was found to be sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin, but resistant to pepsin. Lab-Lemco tryptone broth (LTB), supplemented with 20% of dialyzed protein concentrate of the supernatant, totally inhibited the production of aflatoxins B1 and G1. When the protein concentrate was digested with trypsin, the production of aflatoxins B1 and G1 was restored. The inhibitory activity of the supernatant was inactivated within 10 min at 100 degrees C. A. flavus grown in the Lactobacillus cell-free supernatant did not produce a mutagenic response in the Salmonella mutagenicity test. However, Lactobacillus casei pseudo plantarum 371 did not have an effect on aflatoxin production and mold growth as measured by ergosterol and plate count, when the organisms were inoculated together on sterile steamed rice.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of lactobacilli in a model goats' milk curd system.
AB  - Mesophyllic lactobacilli cultures propagated in MRS broth were inoculated in goats' milk curd slurries and incubated at 30 degrees C for 10 d. The micro-organisms tested were Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei IFPL 731 and IFPL 99, and Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL 3. Whole cells, cell-free extracts and cell lysates were evaluated for acceleration of proteolysis in the curd slurries. Conversion of water-soluble nitrogen to non-protein nitrogen and amino acid nitrogen, reverse phase-HPLC peak areas and ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic peptides, were all affected by the type of inoculum used as well as the strain under study. The results suggest that the accelerated-ripening model system developed, containing cell lysates, may be suitable as a good and rapid indicator of the contribution of the strains to proteolysis during cheese ripening.
TI  - Application of antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria to control pathogens  in ready-to-use vegetables.
AB  - Five psychrotrophic strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lact. plantarum and Pediococcus spp.) were isolated from 22 samples of commercial salads. These strains were shown to inhibit Aeromonas hydrophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus on MRS agar, in salads and in juice prepared from vegetable salads. Lactobacillus casei IMPCLC34 was most effective in reducing total mesophilic bacteria and the coliform group; Aer. hydrophila, Salm. typhimurium and Staph. aureus disappeared after 6 d of storage, while the counts for L. monocytogenes remained constant. The potential application of antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria as biopreservatives of ready-to-use vegetables is suggested.
TI  - Characterization of lactobacilli by Southern-type hybridization with a Lactobacillus plantarum pyrDFE probe.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, and Lactobacillus paraplantarum  (M.-C. Curk, J.-C. Hubert, and F. Bringel, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 46:595-598, 1996) can hardly be distinguished on the basis of their phenotypes. Unlike L. plantarum and L. paraplantarum, L. pentosus ferments glycerol and xylose but not melezitose. We identified two L. pentosus strains (CNRZ 1538 and CNRZ 1544) which ferment glycerol and melezitose but not xylose. alpha-Methyl-D-mannoside was fermented by 66% of the L. plantarum strains tested but not by L. paraplantarum strains. In this paper we describe a simple method to identify L. plantarum, L. pentosus, and L. paraplantarum. This method is based on nonradioactive Southern-type hybridization between BglI DNA digests of the lactobacilli tested and a DNA probe (L. plantarum pyrDFE genes from strain CCM 1904). A total of 68 lactobacilli were classified into five groups on the basis of the bands detected. Two groups contained L. plantarum strains; one of these groups contained 31 strains, including the type strain, and was characterized by bands at 7, 4, and 1 kb, and the other group contained strain LP 85-2 and was characterized by bands at 5 and 1.1 kb. Only one band (a band at around 7 kb) was detected in the strains belonging to the L. pentosus group, and two bands (at 4 and 1 kb) were found in the strains belonging to the L. paraplantarum group. No hybridization was detected in the last group, which contained Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus coryniformis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Lactobacillus leichmannii strains.
TI  - Evaluation of numerical analysis of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR as a method to differentiate Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus grouped into one protein profile cluster at r > or = 0.70, separate from Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus curvatus. Similar sugar fermentation reactions were recorded for representative strains of L. plantarum and L. pentosus. Representative strains, including the type of each species, were selected from the different protein profile clusters and their genetic relatedness determined by using numerical analysis of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. The type strains of L. plantarum (ATCC 14917T) and L. pentosus (NCFB 363T) displayed different RAPD profiles and grouped into two independent clusters, well separated from L. casei, L. curvatus, and L. sake. Numerical analysis of RAPD-PCR proved a reliable and accurate method to distinguish between strains of L. plantarum and L. pentosus.
TI  - The potential of Lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  - Oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (Gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). The adjuvant function of different Lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. After i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high DTH responses were observed with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In different experimental model systems L. casei and L. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. A series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the L. casei L-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the Lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (Pouwels and Leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. Intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. Lactobacilli synthesizing the fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous priming.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  - A total of 169 Lactobacillus strains from 12 species (Lb. acidophilus, Lb. brevis, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lb. plantarum and Lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 Lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates and a tryptic digest of casein. Within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. Furthermore, differences were observed between the Lactobacillus species and Lc. lactis. Lb. helveticus had by far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. On the other hand, Lb. fermentum and Lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. A more detailed study with highly proteolytic Lactobacillus strains indicated that at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. Compared with Lc. lactis, the Lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.
TI  - Detection of polygalacturonases and pectin esterases in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Of 80 strains of lactic acid bacteria tested, only Lactobacillus casei strains HNK10 and L1-8, Lactobacillus plantarum Lc5 and Lactococcus lactis NN01 produced polygalacturonases (EC 3.2.1.) and/or pectin-esterases (EC 3.1.1.). Crude extracellular extracts of strain L1-8 were able to clarify pectin.
TI  - Expression of Bacillus subtilis levanase gene in Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Two Lactobacillus-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors, harbouring the levanase gene  from Bacillus subtilis under the control of its own promoter (pLPEW1) or behind the E. coli tac promoter (pESIEW2), were constructed. Lactobacillus plantarum showed the same growth characteristics on selective plates and in liquid media containing inulin, after transformation with either pLPEW1 or pESIEW2. L. plantarum transformed with pLPEW1 could be selected on inulin plates, indicating that levanase expression can be used as a food-grade selection system for Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus casei grew faster in inulin-containing medium than L. plantarum after transformation with pESIEW2, but did not grow when harbouring pLPEW1. Inulin-degrading activities of 90 mU/ml were found in culture medium of L. plantarum containing pLPEW1 or pESIEW2, and of 500 mU/ml in medium of L. casei (pESIEW2). Addition of 1 mM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside to the culture medium had no effect on growth and levanase expression in L. plantarum (pESIEW2) and L. casei (pESIEW2) strains. Levanase produced by L. casei (pESIEW2) has a size of 75 kDa and 72 kDa, corresponding to that of unprocessed and mature B. subtilis levanase, respectively, suggesting that the protein produced is recognized and processed by a signal peptidase.
TI  - The lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc species, L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. The lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal pH and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. The cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. In the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). By contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. The presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. No doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. Meanwhile the obtention of a Lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified PL1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of L. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.
TI  - Studies on bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus isolates from selected Nigerian fermented foods.
AB  - Ten bacteriocin-producing (bacteriocinogenic) Lactobacillus isolates obtained from three Nigerian fermented foods namely: kenkey, ogi and wara were tested against the following indicator organisms: Lactobacillus plantarum and food borne pathogens comprising enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas cavice, Salmonella typhimurium, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Staphylococcus aureus. All the bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus were found to inhibit L. plantarum while some inhibited some of the food borne pathogens listed above. The antimicrobial activities of bacteriocins from L. plantarum KKY12 and L. casei OGM12 were caused by proteins detectable in the culture liquids. They are designated Plantacin N and Caseicin A and they have narrow antimicrobial spectra. Plantacin N from L. plantarum KKY12 was active against L. plantarum, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas sobria and Aeromonas cavice whereas Caseicin A from L. casei OGM12 inhibited L. plantarum, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. Caseicin A is stable at 121 degrees C/15 mins, and both are inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. The bacteriocinogenic properties of the local isolates of Lactobacillus can help to reduce hygienic risk and the spoilage of fermented foods.
TI  - Characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented Greek  dry salami.
AB  - A total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. The majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus Weissella (120), which was recently proposed (Collins et al., 1993) to include Leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. Meat streptobacteria were identified as Lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and L. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable and, thus designated L. sake/curvatus. Non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as L. plantarum (34 strains), L. farciminis (10), L. coryniformis (1) and L. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). The majority of the Weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as W. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described W. hellenica (Collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled W. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. The latter group comprised strains that produced D(L)-lactate. The remaining Weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to W. minor (31) and W. halotolerans (3). Other species identified were Enterococcus faecium (10), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), L. brevis (1) and Pediococcus sp. (1). The main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - Divergence in codon usage of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - We have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different Lactobacillus species. Codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. Both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. Codon usage in L. acidophilus is similar to that in L. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. pentosus and L. plantarum. Codon usage in the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from that in L. bulgaricus. Inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. L. bulgaricus shows GC drift, whereas all other species show AT drift. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus rarely use NNG in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. This result may be explained by assuming that L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single tRNA species for translation of family-box codons. Differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. Highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. Codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of Lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. The GC content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. The possible implications of a reduced GC content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.
TI  - Biosynthesis of biotin from dethiobiotin by the biotin auxotroph Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum requires biotin for growth. We show that in the presence  of high levels of the biotin biosynthetic precursor, dethiobiotin, L. plantarum synthesizes biotin and grows in medium with dethiobiotin but without biotin. Lactobacillus casei also grew under similar conditions.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus strains isolated from dry fermented sausages.
AB  - One hundred strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from dry cured sausages were tested for antagonistic activity against a set of test strains. Nine of 52 strains of Lactobacillus casei and three of 48 strains of Lact. plantarun produced inhibition zones against the indicator species. The substance excreted by Lact. casei CRL 705 was active against Lact. plantarum, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. The activity of the antibacterial compound from Lact. casei CRL 705 was destroyed by papain, trypsin and pepsin, but was resistant to heat (100 degrees C for 20 min), lysozyme and catalase. The agent was produced during the growth cycle and when the concentrated and neutralized supernatant fluid was added to a fresh culture of sensitive cells it produced a rapid inactivation. A decrease in optical density (O.D.) over time, indicative of cell lysis, was also observed. These characteristics allowed us to identify the inhibitory compound as a bacteriocin which we termed Lactocin 705.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  - Two-hundred and fifty Lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. Data were processed by the Jaccard (SJ) and Simple Matching (SSM) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Seventeen major clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level which approximately correspond to the SSM-level of 91%. Seven clusters could be identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), Lact. buchneri (4% of patients), Lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and Lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). Unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains. Cluster 1 included the type strains of Lact. crispatus, Lact. acidophilus, Lact. jensenii and Lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lact. agilis and Lact. casei subsp. tolerans. Clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. Unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. No obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. Most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. Exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. Cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
TI  - Nonidentity between plasmid and chromosomal copies of ISS1-like sequences in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis CNRZ270 and their possible role in chromosomal integration of plasmid genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of an insertion sequence (IS) observed during mating experiments using the lactose-protease plasmid, pUCL22, of Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis subsp. lactis CNRZ270, was found to be similar to that of ISS1 from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis ML3. The IS was named ISS1RS. The chromosome of this strain contains several copies of ISS1-like IS as assessed by hybridization. One of these copies was cloned and named ISS1CH. Its sequence differs from that of the plasmid-borne copy, and appears to be more closely related to ISS1N from Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11. This suggests independent introduction of both ISS1 elements. Moreover, the observation of plasmid genes integrated in the CNRZ270 chromosome near ISS1CH suggests that their presence is the result of integration by a Campbell mechanism using both IS homologies. ISS1-like sequences were also found on plasmids of numerous Lc. lactis strains, as well as one out of seven Lactobacillus (Lb.) casei and one out of three Lb. plantarum strains examined.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of two cryptic plasmids from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353 and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014.
AB  - The DNA sequences of a 2.4 kb plasmid (p353-2) from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353  and a 1.9 kb plasmid (p8014-2) from Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014 show 81.5% overall similarity. Both plasmids carry elements (replication protein gene, plus-origin and minus-origin of replication), which are typical of plasmids that replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism of replication (RCR). Direct evidence for an RCR mechanism was obtained by showing the accumulation of single-stranded plasmid intermediates in the presence of rifampicin. A minus-origin of replication was defined for plasmids p353-2 and p8014-2 based on DNA sequence analysis and on its ability to convert single-stranded into double-stranded plasmid DNA. Plasmids pLPE323, pLPE350 and pLPC37 that are derived from the p353-2 or p8014-2 replicon are structurally and segregationally stable in L. pentosus MD353, L. plantarum ATCC 8014 and in Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393. The presence of Escherichia coli or lambda DNA fragments in vectors derived from p353-2 or p8014-2 does not affect the structural stability but results in segregational instability of the vectors. The instability increases with increasing size of the inserted DNA fragment. Since vectors based on these replicons can be efficiently propagated in a wide variety of Lactobacillus species, they are highly suitable for cloning and expression of foreign DNA in Lactobacillus, provided that selective pressure is applied.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the cell-envelope-associated proteinase from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NCDO 151.
AB  - The gene encoding the cell-envelope-associated proteinase of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NCDO 151 (formerly Lactobacillus casei NCDO 151) was cloned and sequenced. The gene was located on the chromosome and encoded a polypeptide of 1902 amino acids. The proteinase is N-terminally cleaved upon maturation. It shows extensive homology to the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 proteinase. Similar to the situation in Lactococcus, a maturation gene was found upstream of the proteinase gene. The cloned proteinase gene was expressed in Lactobacillus plantarum. However, no expression was observed when the gene was cloned in Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - [The intestinal microflora of persons subjected to a radiation lesion].
AB  - The content of large intestine has been studied in persons exposed to radiation injury in consequence of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Power Plant. It is stated that bifidobacteria (10(7)-10(10) cells in 1 g of feces) prevailed (as in healthy people), Bifidobacterium indicum being a dominating species. Amount of lactic-acid bacteria in 1 g of defecations of examined patients was within the range of 10(6)-10(9) cells and in certain persons it reached 10(10) cells (primarily fecal Enterococci). A considerable amount of patients with acute radiation sickness of the 3d degree had in their intestine 10(9)/g of lactic-acid bacteria, Lactobacillus casei and L. plantarum prevailing there. The frequency of yeast isolation from defecations of patients constituted 83%, while the number of cells in 1 g of feces--from 10 to 10(4). Yeast of the Candida genus, mainly Candida parapsilosis, prevailed. The species composition of isolated microorganisms has no substantial differences from microcenosis of healthy people. The content of intestine of persons suffered from radiation is characterized only by greater amount of lactic-acid bacteria and enterococci as compared with healthy adults.
TI  - Penetration of poultry meat byPseudomonas andLactobacillus spp.
AB  - The penetration of poultry muscle strips byPseudomonas putida, P. fragi, Lactobacillus plantarum andL. casei was studied at 37 degrees C. The first three bacteria penetrated along the muscular septa whileLactobacillus casei did not invade the poultry muscle strips at all. The penetration by both pseudomonads occurred throughout the 3 cm muscle strip butL. plantarum showed minor penetration up to 2 cm only.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli and streptococci.
AB  - Of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria commonly used as starter cultures for the dalry industry and ensiling, six (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. acidophilus CH=5, L. plantarum, Streptococcus latis and Strep. taecium) had antibiotic activity. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics. The most sensitive strain of Staphylococcus aureus was used as a target micro-organism for the characterization of the antimicrobial substance. The cultures of Streptococcus faecium and L. plantarum gave the most intense antimicrobial activity. Adding CaCO3 to the medium (to bind accumulated lactic acid) increased the antibiotic activity of the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - D-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of the D-isomer-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family. Cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli of the D-lactate dehydrogenase gene of Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - The gene encoding D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-lactate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28) of Lactobacillus plantarum has been sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli cells with an inducible expression plasmid, in which the 5'-noncoding region of the gene was replaced with the tac promoter. Comparison of the sequence of D-lactate dehydrogenase with L-lactate dehydrogenases, including the L. plantarum L-lactate dehydrogenase, showed no significant homology. In contrast, the D-lactate dehydrogenase is homologous to E. coli D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and Lactobacillus casei D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. This indicates that D-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of a new family of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases recently proposed, being distinct from L-lactate dehydrogenase and L-malate dehydrogenase, and strongly suggests that the new family consists of D-isomer-stereospecific enzymes. In the reductive reaction, the enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity, although pyruvate was the most favorable of all 2-ketocarboxylic acids tested. In particular, hydroxypyruvate is effectively reduced by the enzyme, the reaction rate, and Km value being comparable to those in the case of pyruvate, indicating that the enzyme has not only D-lactate dehydrogenase activity but also D-glycerate dehydrogenase activity. The conserved residues in this family appear to be the residues involved in the substrate binding and the catalytic reaction, and thus to be targets for site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - Incompatibility of Lactobacillus Vectors with Replicons Derived from Small Cryptic Lactobacillus Plasmids and Segregational Instability of the Introduced Vectors.
AB  - Three new Lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic Lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194, and pUC19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE317 and pLPE323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397-401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. The curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far.
TI  - Influence of aflatoxin B1 on gas production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The main characteristic of homofermentative lactic acid bacteria is that they do  not produce gas from glucose and other sugars. However, in these experiments Lactobacillus casei, Lb. plantarum and Streptococcus lactis in broth media with glucose, galactose, lactose and sucrose, and aflatoxin B1 produces acid and also a significant amount of gas. In the control media without aflatoxin, these bacteria did not produce gas. The data suggest that lactic acid bacteria, known until now as homofermentative, become heterofermentative because of the influence of aflatoxin B1. The results of these investigations are of practical value because they may explain the defect of cheese "blowing," which can appear in Trapist cheese vacuum packed in foil. This type of unusual "blowing" occurs approximately one month after cheese manufacture. This defect can be characterized by very large holes and cracks inside the cheese. The flavor is similar to that of young cheese, which can be very undesirable for a ripened, Trapist, aged cheese.
TI  - [Penicillin-binding proteins of various strains of Lactobacillus].
AB  - Sensitivity of different species of Lactobacillus i.e. L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophillus, L. buchneri, L. jugurti and others to penicillins and cephalosporins of various generations was studied. Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of the Lactobacillus species were specified. It was shown that the number of PBPs depended on the Lactobacillus species. L. casei had the least number of PBPs (4) and L. brevis had the highest number of PBPs (11). Competition of 14C-benzylpenicillin with ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime and cefoperazone for binding to separate PBPs in three strains of different Lactobacillus species was investigated.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase activity in some strains of lactobacilli: induction by manganese.
AB  - Dialyzed cell-free extract of lactobacilli was found to contain superoxide dismutase activity by using a test system in which superoxide ion is generated by xanthine oxidase. The specific activities of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus murinus ATCC 35020, Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 358, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014, Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 353, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 9338, Lactobacillus buchneri NCDO 110, and Lactobacillus fermentum CRL 251 were between 0.06 and 0.43 U/mg protein. The presence of superoxide dismutase activity was demonstrated when the strains were grown in media containing Mn2+ ions. Superoxide dismutase of lactobacilli may be an Mn enzyme since it was not inhibited by either cyanide or azide ions. However, the cell-free extract of Lactobacillus murinus ATCC 35020 contains superoxide dismutase activity sensitive to both ions.
TI  - Characterization of a Lactobacillus strain producing white crystals on cheddar cheese.
AB  - From an enrichment culture of white-crystal deposits from aged Cheddar cheese, an atypical Lactobacillus strain was characterized. The new isolate is facultatively heterofermentative, has a G + C content of 40 mol%, and produces D and L isomers of lactic acid. The strain had a limited ability to ferment carbohydrates. It utilized fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannose, and ribose but was negative for esculin, gluconate, citrate, and several other carbon sources. The isolate also had low DNA-DNA homologies with strains of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum. Cheese prepared with milk containing the isolate developed white crystals during curing. Formation of copious D-lactate from unknown substrates during curing probably caused the white-crystal deposits. The strain has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 49178).
TI  - The effect of pH on the sensitivity of species of Lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of Lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, Minocycline, and Spiramycin, at a range of pH from 5.0 to 7.4. Strains of Streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. There were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. The strains tested were sensitive at pH 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/mL): L. casei (6 strains), 10-60; L. plantarum (4 strains), 40; L. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; L. brevis (1 strain), 10; and L. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. The Streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/mL (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/mL (3 strains); and 10-20 micrograms/mL (2 strains). One strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/mL. Chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower pH levels. The following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/mL) at pH 6.5 followed by sensitivity at pH 5.0: L. casei (ATCC 15008), 40,60; L. plantarum (CH 374), 40,100; L. fermentum (CH 324) 10,40; L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356), 10,40; and S. mutans (BM 52), 2,2. All of the strains of Lactobacillus tested with Spiramycin were resistant at pH 5.0. Minocycline was less affected by changes in pH, but at pH 7.4 Lactobacillus strains were more resistant to Minocycline as compared with Spiramycin. Both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. The Lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of Streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.
TI  - [Reciprocal effect of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Lactobacillus on their cytadhesion].
AB  - Reciprocal effect of 4 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 6 Lactobacillus strains on their cytadhesion in mixed populations was studied on a model of formalinized human erythrocytes. The Lactobacillus strains included 2 strains of Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, 2 strains of L. plantarum and 2 strains of L. fermentum. It was shown that adhesion of both the Klebsiella and the Lactobacillus strains changed under their reciprocal effect. The changes were characterized by the strain differences and depended on the quantitative ratio of the microorganisms.
TI  - Cytotoxic activity of lactobacilli isolated from plant and dairy sources.
AB  - Forty four cultures of Lactobacilli isolated from their natural sources such as dahi, raw milk and fermenting rice-pulse doughs etc. along with four standard strains of Lactobacilli were assayed for their cytotoxic activity against three secondary tumour cell lines. Three cultures isolated from dahi samples and identified as Lactobacillus casei D-34, L. casei D-48a, L. plantarum D-70a along with one standard strain L. casei B 1922 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity in the range of 30 to 36%.
TI  - Enhancement of host resistance against Listeria infection by Lactobacillus casei: efficacy of cell wall preparation of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Cell wall, cytoplasm, polysaccharide, and peptidoglycan fractions prepared from Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were examined for their efficacies to enhance resistance of host mice against Listeria monocytogenes infection. Intraperitoneal injections of those cellular fractions of L. casei led to elicitation of inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity and the efficacy was highest in the case of peptidoglycan. Macrophage ratio in the resultant peritoneal exudate cells was also highest in mice given peptidoglycan. Macrophages induced with cell wall fraction of L. casei showed the most potent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-triggered respiratory burst (chemiluminescence and O2- production determined on the basis of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) followed by those elicited with peptidoglycan. All the macrophages induced with cell wall of L. casei (two strains) and L. acidophilus enhanced O2- production in response to PMA but L. plantarum did not enhance O2(-)-producing ability in such a manner. The L. casei-cell wall also enhanced in vitro listericidal activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages, but such an activity was not noted in the case of L. acidophilus-cell wall. When mice were intravenously given the cellular fractions 7 or 13 days before L. monocytogenes infection, cell wall fractions of L. casei caused the most potent protective activity. A weak protective activity was also found in peptidoglycan of L. casei. Therefore, the protective action of L. casei against L. monocytogenes infection in host mice may be attributed to cell wall compounds and partially to the peptidoglycan moiety.
TI  - Plasmid-Associated Bacteriocin Production and Sucrose Fermentation in Pediococcus acidilactici.
AB  - Production of bacteriocin activity designated pediocin PA-1 was associated with the presence of a 6.2-megadalton plasmid in Pediococcus acidilactici PAC1.0. The bacteriocin exhibited activity against P. acidilactici, P. pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. bifermentans, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum. Partial characterization of pediocin PA-1 is described. The molecular weight of pediocin PA-1 was ca. 16,500. Additionally, strain PAC1.0 was found to contain a 23-megadalton plasmid associated with sucrose-fermenting ability.
TI  - [Taxonomic study of epiphyte lactic bacteria in grapes in Galicia].
AB  - A taxonomic analysis of the malolactic microflora present in nine grape samples from different zones of Galicia, was carried out. Nineteen strains were isolated and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (42%), L. brevis (10.6%), L. casei (5.25%), L. hilgardii (5.25%), Streptococcus cremoris (5.25%), Leuconostoc lactis (5.25%), L. oenos (10.6%), and Pediococcus acidilactici (15.8%).
TI  - [Extraintestinal isolation of Salmonella in chickens: epidemiologic study of 3 salmonellosis outbreaks after ingestion of raw eggs].
AB  - A taxonomic analysis of the malolactic microflora present in nine grape samples from different zones of Galicia, was carried out. Nineteen strains were isolated and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (42%), L. brevis (10.6%), L. casei (5.25%), L. hilgardii (5.25%), Streptococcus cremoris (5.25%), Leuconostoc lactis (5.25%), L. oenos (10.6%), and Pediococcus acidilactici (15.8%).
TI  - Lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
AB  - Similar to Streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. For Lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at pHs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. Furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. Noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate. For F. nucleatum suspended at pH 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/L bicarbonate activation. When lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, pH 5.3, lysis was observed only with L. plantarum and S. mutans, but not with L. casei. The latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. In experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for L. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to salivary factors other than lysozyme. F. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral pH, suggesting that both Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.
TI  - Peptidases of Lactobacillus casei and L. plantarum.
AB  - Fractionation of cell-free extracts of Lactobacillus casei NCDO 151 (grown in Man's et al. (1960) broth) by polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis showed the presence of 4 constitutive peptidases. The enzymes appear to be a tripeptidase with a narrow substrate specificity, two true dipeptidases with identical broad-specificity, and a probable carboxypeptidase with broad-specificity. A probable amino peptidase could also be isolated from the cell-free extract by density gradient electrofocusing. Growth of the organism in skim milk resulted in the formation of two inducible dipeptidases. Examination of 5 other strains of L. casei for the presence of the two constitutive dipeptidases and the carboxypeptidase confirmed the results obtained for the species. Some strains, however, had one more peptidase. The peptidases of the strains differed relatively in the activity and substrate specificity from strain to strain. On polyacrylamide gel, the peptidase activity of L. plantarum appeared as one band only, probably of a carboxypeptidase.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of crude cell-free extract of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Crude cell-free extracts of some strains of each L. casei and L. plantarum were assayed for their amino-, imino- and endopeptidase as well as the caseinolytic activity. L-alanine-, L-phenylalanine- and L-leucine-p-nitroanilide but not L-glutamic acid-p-nitroanilide, were hydrolyzed by all the strains indicating an amino-peptidase activity. The activity of proline iminopeptidase was very low compared to that of the aminopeptidase. L. casei could be distinguished from L. plantarum by its high endopeptidase activity against succinyl-phenylalanine- and glutaryl-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide. The caseinolytic activity of cell-free extract of L. casei ATCC 393 was about one seventh the caseinolytic activity of intact cells, suggesting that the bulk of the cellular proteinase activity is located in the cell wall. It appears that a metallo aminopeptidase and a probable cysteine one are involved in the hydrolysis of amino acid-p-nitroanilide, whereas the endopeptidase activity appears to be related to a cysteine enzyme. Incubation of gels with L-leucine-p-nitroanilide after electrophoresis allowed the revealing of 2 zones of aminopeptidase activity in a strain of L. casei and only one in two others, but in L. plantarum it did not allow the revealing of any. The high proteolytic activities of L. casei compared to those of L. plantarum may explain its more frequent occurrence in cheese and its probable role in the ripening of many cheese varieties.
TI  - Proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk with special reference  to the biodegradation of casein fractions.
AB  - Streptococci and lactobacilli were assayed for their proteolytic activity in pasteurised (95 degrees C for 30 min) fresh Friesian cows' skim milk incubated at 30 degrees C for 48 h. Lactobacilli were more proteolytic than the streptococci except S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens. S. faecalis and S. thermophilus followed S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis in the proteolytic activity. Electrophoretic analysis of the precipitated casein revealed K-, pre-beta- and the small slow band of alpha s1-casein to be the most fractions and beta-casein the least fraction susceptible to the biodegradation. S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was the only organism able to degrade beta-casein to 3 fractions within 48 h. S. lactis with its subsp. diacetylactis was characterized by its inability to degrade gamma-casein. Addition of 2.0 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 2.0 mmol Mg2+, 0.5 mmol Mn2+ and 0.1 mmol Fe2+/l of skim milk culture of each L. casei and L. plantarum increased acid formation but decreased proteolysis. 6% NaCl was inhibitory to both. After 60 days at 18 degrees C, a fraction, probably derived from beta-casein, was noticeable. The large intense band of alpha s1-casein appears to be degraded gradually to only small peptides which in turn are transferred immediately into the cells. The hydrolysis of gamma-casein and beta-casein also appears to be inhibited by exogenously supplied NaCl and nutrients, respectively.
TI  - Specific nutritional requirements of Lactobacilli spp. from meat.
AB  - The nutritive requirements of atypical streptobacteria isolated from fresh meat were examined. Niacin and pantothenate were essential for all strains and some strains also required pyridoxal phosphate and riboflavin. Most of them were characterized by their great requirements for aminoacids and their failure to ferment many sugars compared with L. plantarum or L. casei.
TI  - [Enhancement of the phagocytic activity of cells of the mononuclear phagocytosing system by the peroral administration of lactobacilli].
AB  - The phagocytic function of the peritoneal exudate cells after oral and intraperitoneal administration of Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, L. plantarum and L. fermentum was studied on mice C57Bl and inbred rats CDF/F344/Crl. The phagocytic function was estimated by the capacity for absorbing and excreting 14C-labeled typhoid vaccine. Intraperitoneal administration of a mixture of various Lactobacillus strains resulted in two-fold increase of the bacteria absorption and digestion when the Lactobacillus strains were administered 4 days before administration of the test antigen. On their simultaneous administration the phagocytic function of the peritoneal exudate cells lowered. Oral administration of the Lactobacillus strains for 6 and 18 days resulted, respectively, in 1.5- and 3-fold increase of absorption and digestion of the labeled typhoid vaccine. This route of Lactobacillus administration provided more rapid increase of the level of the antibodies to the typhoid antigen. Possible immunomodulating action of Lactobacillus administered orally is discussed.
TI  - [Characteristics of blastolysin preparations in their ability to inhibit hemagglutination caused by bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus].
AB  - Anabol and blastolysin preparations obtained from L. bulgaricus may contain surface structural components of the initial strain with adhesion activity; of these, one is similar in specificity to L. casei adhesin and the other, to L. plantarum adhesin. The antigenic activity of anabol and blastolysin, evaluated in the immunodiffusion test, does not correlate with their capacity for binding the receptors of susceptible bacterial cells, determined in the Lactobacillus-induced hemagglutination inhibition test.
TI  - [Standardization of the direct hemagglutination reaction induced by bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus].
AB  - L. bulgaricus, L. casei var. rhamnosus, and L. plantarum cells grown in agar-containing (but not liquid) thioglycol medium for 3 days have been shown to be capable of inducing mannose-resistant agglutination of human and guinea-pig erythrocytes, while giving a considerably weaker reaction with erythrocytes from animals of other species (ox, sheep, dog, rabbit, rat and mouse). The optimum conditions for the test are presented.
TI  - Induction by Lactobacillus casei of increase in macrophage colony-forming cells and serum colony-stimulating activity in mice.
AB  - The content of macrophage colony-forming cells (M-CFC) and the serum colony-stimulating activity (CSA) were investigated in mice after intravenous administration of Lactobacillus casei YIT9018 (LC9018). In normal BALB/c mice, 500 micrograms of LC9018 increased both femoral and splenic M-CFC; the highest levels were found a few days and a week, respectively, after the administration. LC9018 also induced an increase in splenic M-CFC in C3H/HeJ mice as well as in C3H/HeN mice, unlike lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which was ineffective in C3H/HeJ mice. In Meth A-bearing BALB/c mice, LC9018 (250 micrograms X 5) suppressed the growth of tumor cells and increased femoral and splenic M-CFC to much greater extents than Lactobacillus plantarum YIT0102 (250 micrograms X 5) did. LC9018 induced a rise of serum granulocyte-macrophage CSA in the same way as LPS. Sera taken 6 hr after LPS administration, when transferred to normal mice, induced increases in femoral and splenic M-CFC. However, sera taken 6 hr after LC9018 administration increased neither femoral nor splenic M-CFC. These results indicate that LC9018 modulates myelopoiesis at least at the stage of the proliferation of M-CFC in a different way from LPS, and this ability may be related to its antitumor activity.
TI  - Lactobacillus endocarditis.
AB  - Two cases of endocarditis due to Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei  var. rhamnosus are described. Both patients were successfully treated medically. The response of the two isolates to a range of concentrations of penicillin in an apparatus which continuously monitored growth is reported. The strain of L. casei var. rhamnosus was found to be penicillin tolerant. The use of a combination of a penicillin with gentamicin to treat endocarditis due to penicillin tolerant strains of lactobacillus is discussed. The criteria for selecting oral agents to follow intravenous therapy are assessed also.
TI  - Acute joint inflammation in mice after systemic injection of the cell wall, its peptidoglycan, and chemically defined peptidoglycan subunits from various bacteria.
AB  - The systemic injection of an aqueous suspension of cell wall or its peptidoglycan (PG)-rich sonicate derived from group A streptococcus and Lactobacillus casei induced acute joint lesions in BALB/c, DBA/1J, (BALB/c X DBA/1J)F1, and C3H/He mouse strains, but not in C57BL/6, DBA/2, and AKR strains. Cell walls and their enzymatically degraded PG fragments from other bacteria as well as the synthetic disaccharide dipeptide and Lactobacillus plantarum cell wall-derived disaccharide tripeptide produced similar acute inflammation in susceptible BALB/c mice. Acute swelling and erythema of the ankles and wrists were observed as early as 3 h, reached maximum severity by day 2, and generally subsided by days 4 to 6 after injection. Histological studies showed synovial proliferation, marked infiltration of many mononuclear cells and a few polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the soft tissues, and extensive deposition of fibrinous exudate in the joint space. Antibody response was detectable against the PG fraction. However, anti-PG antibody does not seem to be responsible for the pathogenesis of this disease. On the other hand, experiments on decomplementation by cobra venom factor suggest that complement components are involved in the early phase of this arthritic model.
TI  - Nucleic acids of species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named Lactobacillus species was studied. Nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic reactions. The overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 X 10(6) daltons. Sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 X 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus Bacillus. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees C below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. The genus can be divided into three major groups, each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. Group I (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus sanfrancisco. Group II (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus brevis, and Group III (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
TI  - Presence of Lactobacillus casei in saliva from children and adults using a new medium.
AB  - The aim of this study was to devise a medium for cultivation of L. casei and to compare the presence of L. casei in saliva from children and adults. The new medium was produced by omitting the sugars from Rogosa SL agar medium and supplementing this medium with melezitose. Although all tested strains of lactobacilli grew on the new medium, the facultatively homofermentative lactobacilli, L. casei and L. plantarum, could be identified by a typical colonial morphology. L. casei was the most common species of oral lactobacilli in saliva from children and made up a significantly higher proportion of the salivary lactobacillus flora in children than in adults.
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
TI  - Metabolism of pyruvate and citrate in lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii , L. lactis and L. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. The presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. L. casei and L. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while L. casei also produced diacetyl. L. casei and L. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. L. helveticus and L. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate under the conditions used.
TI  - [Bacteriocin typing of Lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  - Lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. L. acidophilus-L. salivarious, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. buchneri, L. helveticus, L. lactis and L. leichmannii were used in the study. The cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. The method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. It allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. This may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - [Sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus Thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
AB  - Sensitivity of 278 cultures of Thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. It was shown that all cultures of L. Salivarius, L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of L. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. The cultures of L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
TI  - Multiple nutritional requirements of lactobacilli: genetic lesions affecting amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
AB  - Genetic lesions responsible for amino acid requirements in several species of multiple auxotrophic lactobacilli were investigated. Systematic attempts were made to isolate mutants that could grow in the absence of each of the amino acids required by the parental strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. helveticus, and L. acidophilus. After treatment with appropriate mutagens, such mutants could be obtained with respect to many but not all required amino acids. Successful isolation of mutants for a given amino acid means that a minor genetic lesion reparable by single-step mutations affects its biosynthesis; a failure to isolate mutants suggests the involvement of more extensive lesions. Analysis of these results as well as the specific requirements exhibited by the parental strains revealed certain regularities; some of the biosynthetic pathways for individual amino acids were virtually unaffected by more extensive lesions in at least species tested, whereas others were affected by more extensive lesions in at least some species. Both the number and the kind of pathways affected by extensive lesions differed appreciably among different species. Furthermore, the growth response of the parental strains to some putative amino acid precursors revealed a clear correlation between the extent of genetic lesions and the occurrence and location of a genetic block(s) for a given pathway. These findings are discussed in relation to the phylogeny, ecology, and evolution of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Effect of lactobacilli on urinary indican excretion in gnotobiotic rats and in man.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus species on urinary indican excretion in two types of  gnotobiotic rats (GBH-9 and GB-5) and in man was studied. L. salivarius, L. plantarum and L. casei colonized in the cecum and colon of both types of rats at levels of 10(7) to 10(8) per gram of contents following one-dose oral administration and caused a significant reduction in urinary indican excretion, whereas two strains of L. acidophilus which colonized at low levels (10(4) to 10(5)/g) did not reduce indican excretion. Daily feeding of Lactobacillus concentrates caused a further significant reduction in indican excretion which was corrected by tryptophan intake, even in the case of L. acidophilus. There was a clear relationship between fecal lactobacillus counts and urinary indican. A significant reduction of indican secretion was obtained only when the fecal counts of lactobacilli exceeded 10(7).4/g in rats. L. casei also had an effect in man, reducing urinary excretion of indican and p-cresol. Reduction in indican excretion seems to be accompanied by decreasing fecal tryptophanase activity in rats and man. A negative correlation was also obtained between fecal resident lactobacilli and urinary indican in man (r = -0.532, n = 28, p less than 0.01). Subjects with lactobacilli at a level of 10(6)/g or more excreted less indican than those harboring the bacteria at levels below 10(5)/g.
TI  - [Bacteriocin properties of lactobacilli of the subgenus Streptobacterium].
AB  - Morphology of the growth inhibition zones of Lactobacilli indicator strains, as well as cellophane diffusion, thermostability, sensitivity to bacterial proteases, trypsin, chemotrypsin, pepsin, papain, nucleases and lysosyme of 3 bacteriocins produced by L. casei and 2 bacteriocins produced by L. plantarum was studied. By differences in their properties the bacteriocins were divided into 5 types, including 3 types of bacteriocins from L. casei and 2 types of bacteriocins from L. plantarum.
TI  - Factors affecting the quaternary structure of the allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus curvatus as investigated by hybridization and ultracentrifugation.
AB  - The allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenases of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus casei exist in the tetrameric from (molecular weight about 145 000) at pH 5.0--5.5 even in the absence of the effectors Mn2+ and Fru(1,6)P2 (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), but undergo reversible dissociation to monomers (molecular weight about 35 000) at higher pH values or in the presence of urea. In the range between pH 5.5 (tetrameric state) and pH 7.4 (monomeric state) the L. curvatus L-lactate dehydrogenase exists in a dissociation-association equilibrium comprising tetramers, dimers and monomers as indicated by the Sc20,w values and the results of hybridization experiments. The simultaneous addition of both effectors [Mn2+ and Fru(1,6)P2] at pH 7.4, however, resulted in the stabilization of the tetrameric form. The addition of Fru(1,6)P2 alone at pH 7.4 had almost no influence on the quarternary structure, whereas the addition of Mn2+, as well as that of NADH, largely prevented dissociation. The L-lactate dehydrogenase of L. casei showed similar properties, although the enzyme dissociates only at about pH greater than or equal to 7.8. As in the case of the L. curvatus enzyme, Fru(1,6)P2 has no influence on the pH-dependent dissociation of the L. casei enzyme, whereas Mn2+ stabilizes the tetrameric structure. Reconstitution of a mixture of the two dissociated enzymes results in the formation of all statistically possible, enzymatically active hybrids. No hybridization between the allosteric enzymes from L. casei and L. curvatus and the non-allosteric ones of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus was observed.
TI  - The microbial flora of Awshari cheese with special reference to Lactobacilli.
AB  - Thirty-seven samples of Awshari cheese and 13 of Biza were examined microbiologically. Penicillia occurred in 2 samples of cheese and yeasts in 21, 3 of which contained Saccharomyces lactis. In 8 samples studied for the constitutive microflora, lactobacilli and streptococci were the most prevalent, with L. casei being the only Lactobacillus species isolated. Penicillia and yeasts occurred in all the samples of Biza, with Saccharomyces lactis being encountered in 5 out of 6 samples examined for the type of yeasts. The microbial flora consisted primarily of lactobacilli. Out of 98 lactobacilli isolated from 10 samples 55 were identified as betabacteria: 41 were attached to L. brevis, 13 L. buchneri and 1 L. pasteurianus. The remaining 43 isolates were streptobacteria: 21 belonged to L. coryniformis, 5 L. casei ssp pseudoplantarum, 3 ssp casei and 1 ssp alactosus, 2 L. plantarum ssp plantarum and 1 ssp arabinosus, 1 L. xylosus, 5 motile streptobacteria and 4 unidentifiable.
TI  - Reassembly of the regularly arranged subunits in the cell wall os Lactobacillus brevis and their reattachment to cell walls.
AB  - The reassembly of tetragonally arranged subunits in the cell wall of Lactobacillus brevis and the reattachment of the subunits to cell wall fragments were investigated by electron microscopy. The subunits dissociated from the cell wall with guanidine hydrochloride (GHCl) reassembled into the same regular array as seen in native cell wall after dialysis against neutral buffer even in the absence of specific cations. The subunits could also reattach to the cell wall fragments from which they had been removed by treatment with GHCl, sodium dodecyl sulfate or cold trichloroacetic acid but not to those treated with hot formamide. Heterologous reattachment of the subunits occurred on cell wall fragments obtained from L. fermentum but not on those from L plantarum or L. casei subsp. casei. On the basis of these observations and chemical analyses of the cell wall fragments, the subunits of L. brevis appeared to be bound by hydrogen bonds to a neutral polysaccharide moiety in the cell wall but not to peptidoglycan or teichoic acid.
TI  - [The microflora of sour dough. IV. Communication: bacterial composition of sourdough starters genus Lactobacillus beijerinck (author's transl)].
AB  - The bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the genus Beijerinck. According to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: Thermobacterium (L. acidophilus), Streptobacterium (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. farciminis, L. alimentarius) and Betabacterium (L. brevis, L. brevis var. lindneri, L buchneri, L. fermentum, L. fructi vorans). In the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. In starter preparation "A" only the varieties L. fructi vorans and L. fermentum were present. Preparation "B" contained a great variety of microorganisms with L. brevis and L. brevis L. lindneri predominating. In starter "C" L. brevis, L. plantarum and L. alimentarius predominated.
TI  - On the relationship between glycerophosphoglycolipids and lipoteichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria. II. Structures of glycerophosphoglycolipids.
AB  - 1. Eight glycerophosphoglycolipids were isolated from six Gram-positive bacteria. Besides sn-glycero-1-phospho-beta-gentiobiosyldiacylglycerol (i) and sn-glycero-1-phospho-alpha-kojibiosyldiacylglycerol (ii), three novel structures have been established: 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-O-acyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (iii), 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]glycerol (iv), and 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-O-acyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]glycerol (v). 2. Compound i was isolated from Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, compound ii from a group B Streptococcus, compounds ii and iii from Streptococcus lactis, compounds iv and v from Lactobacillus casei. Lactobacillus plantarum contained besides compounds iv and v a glycerophosphate derivative of 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[alpha-D-galactopyranosyl (1 leads to 2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]glycerol. 3. Identical structural features of the described glycerophosphoglycolipids and the corresponding lipoteichoic acids are discussed.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  - Against Enterobacter aerogenes 13048, Serratia marcescens 13880, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Escherichia coli 9723, Lactobacillus casei 7469, Lactobacillus plantarum 8014, Leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and Streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. Under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. In addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at pH 7, as compared with that of amphotericin B, at 2 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Comparative studies of lactate dehydrogenases in lactic acid bacteria. Amino-acid composition of an active-site region and chemical properties of the L-lactate dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The molecular weight, the amino acid composition and the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acids of two allosteric (Lactobacillus casei, L. curvatus) and two non-allosteric (L. plantarum, L. acidophilus) L-lactate dehydrogenases, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, were determined. The amino acid composition of the only tryptic peptide unequivocally common to the fingerprints of the 4 enzymes is virtually identical with that of the arginine peptide, called Arg6 of the the substratebinding site of the L-lactate dehydrogenase dehydrogenase of several animals. However, the 'essential' cysteine residue 165 is replaced by threonine, as it is in the L-lactate dehydrogenase of lobster. In addition, the 4 bacterial peptides differ by one or two changes in single amino acid residues from each other as well as from those of animals. The data indicate that not only the animal L-lactate dehydrogenases, but also the allosteric and lactate dehydrogenases from bacterial sources may have evolved from a common gene.
TI  - [Lactobacilli of freshwater fishes].
AB  - Normal microflora in the intestinal tract of fishes inhabiting fresh-water reservoirs includes lactic bacteria. The number of the bacteria depends on the animal species, the composition of food, the age, and the season. The highest number of these microorganisms (hundreds of millions per gram of the intestinal content) is found in carps. Enterococci are most often encountered in fishes inhabiting ponds: Streptococcus faecalis Andrewes a. Horder, Str. faecium Orla-Jensen, Str. bovis Orla-Jensen. Lactobacilli are more typical of fishes in water reserviors: Lactobacillus plantarum (Orla-Jensen) Bergey et al., L. casei (Orla-Jensen) Hansen a. Lessel, L. casei var. casei, L. casei var. rhamnosus, L. Casei var. alactosus, L. leichmannii (Henneberg) Bergey et al., L. acidophillus (Moro) Hansen a. Mocquot, L. Fermenti Beijerinck, L. cellobiosus Rogosa et al., L. Buchneri (Henneberg) Bergey et al. The content of lactic bacteria varies in water reservoirs; their highest content is found in ooze (tens of thousands per gram).
TI  - [Bacteriocin typing of lactobacilli of the Streptobacterium subgenus].
AB  - Sensitivity of 144 L. casei cultures and 23 L. plantarum cultures to the action of 39 bacteriocins produced by lactobacillae of different species was studied by the method of delayed antagonism. By the bacteriocin sensitivity the L. casei cultures were subdivided into 37 and L. plantarum cultures--into 7 bacteriocin types. The method of bacteriocin typing permitted differentiation of the L. casei and L. plantarum cultures, which had the same biochemical and physiological properties, as a number of bacteriocin types.
TI  - Purification, properties and immunological relationship of L (+)-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-activated L-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) from Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 has been purified to homogenity by including affinity chromatography (cibacronblue-Sephadex-G-200) and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into the purification procedures. The enzyme has an Mr of 132000-135000 with a subunit Mr of 34000. The pH optimum was found to be 5.4 insodium acetate buffer. Tris/maleate and citrate/phosphate buffers inhibited enzyme activity at this pH. The enzyme was completely inactivated by a temperature increase from 60 degrees C to 70 degrees C. Pyruvate saturation curves were sigmoidal in the absence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of 20 muM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate a Km of 1.0 mM for pyruvate was obtained, whereas fructose 1,6-bisphosphate had no effect on the Km of 0.01 mM for NADH. The use of pyruvate analogues revealed two types of pyruvate binding sites, a catalytic and an effector site. The enzyme from L. casei appears to be subject to strict metabolic control, since ADP, ATP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate are strong inhibitors. Immunodiffusion experiments with a rabbit antiserum to L. casei lactate dehydrogenase revealed that L. casei ATCC 393 L (+)-lactate dehydrogenase is probably not immunologically related to group D and group N streptococci. Of 24 lactic acid bacterial strains tested only 5 strains did cross-react: L. casei ATCC 393 = L. casei var. rhamnosus ATCC 7469 - L. casei var. alactosus NCDO 680 greater than L. casei UQM 95 greater than L. plantarum ATCC 14917.
TI  - [Sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus Streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
AB  - Sensitivity of 167 cultures of Lactobacilli of Streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. jugurti, L. salivarius, L. lactis, L. helveticus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermenti, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied. It was found that the cultures of L. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of L. casei and all cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by Lactobacilli of different species.
TI  - [Decomposition of grass-fructosanes by lactobacilli from silage (author's transl)].
AB  - Lactobacilli isolated from grass silage were shown to belong to Lb. plantarum, Lb. casei and Lb. brevis. In studies on the degradation of fructosanes significant differences among the three species were found. While all strains of L. casei were able to degrade fructosanes from Dactylis glomerata or Phleum pratense regardless of the degree of polymerization, no nember of Lb. plantarum or Lb. brevis could attack these polysaccharides.
TI  - [Bacteriocinogeny in lactobacilli of the subgenus Streptobacterium].
AB  - Bacteriocinogenic properties of 145 strains of L. casei and 23 strains of L. plantarum were studied by the method of delayed antagonism. The capacity for producing bacteriocins was observed in 2 per cent of L. casei and 26 per cent of L. plantarum. The bacteriocins of L. casei and L. plantarum were preliminarily divided into 3 and 2 types respectively by their activity against lactobacilli of different species and the character of the growth inhibition zones of the indicator strain.
TI  - [The fecal flora of man. III. Communication: The composition of Lactobacillus flora of different age groups (author's transl)].
AB  - From fecal flora of 66 infants aged 3 to 220 days, 29 children aged 4 to 6 years, 42 adults aged 20 to 64 years and 21 senile persons aged 65 to 86 years, the Lactobacillus flora was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. In the feces of babies only the resident lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. fermenti) were found, while in the feces of children, adults and senile persons the resident lactobacilli as well as the transient lactobacilli (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. lactis) were found simultaneously. Within the Lactobacillus species L. acidophilus type I, L. fermenti type IVa and L. salivarius type Ia were most frequently found in the feces of all age groups. In addition, L. acidophilus type X was also often found in the feces of senile persons. In connection with the numbers of species or types of lactobacilli in one fecal specimen, one or two species or types were demonstrated in 94,5% of positive cases of infants. With increasing age the numbers increased, especially more than three species or types were demonstrated in 85% of positive cases. In infants in 3 different clinics, clinic-specificities were demonstrated in relation to the species or types of lactobacilli isolated: in each clinic clearly certain species or types of lactobacilli were present. The results indicate that the composition of the Lactobacillus flora in the feces is influenced by lactobacilli orally ingested.

TI  - Lactobacilli on plants.
AB  - The distribution, enumeration, and identification of lactobacilli on vegetable plants were studied in an area described geographically as being subtropical and moist. The lactobacilli were obtained, by means of quantitative enrichment procedures in Rogosa's SL broth, from 35.3% of all samples incubated at 32 C, and from 15.4% of the samples incubated at 45 C. Less than 10 lactobacilli/g of plant material were enumerated in 54% of all positive samples. The lactobacilli were found much less frequently and in lower numbers than were streptococci or Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The most frequently isolated lactobacillus was very simular to, but not identical with, Lactobacillus fermenti. It was aerogenic, grew well at both 15 and 45 C, fermented arabinose, lactose, and sucrose, and liberated ammonia from arginine. Of the identified species, L. plantarum, L. fermenti, and L. brevis were the most frequently isolated, whereas L. casei, L. viridescens, L. cellobiosus, L. salivarius, and L. buchneri were obtained from small numbers of samples. The widespread but sporadic distribution of lactobacilli in low numbers seems to indicate that these organisms do not normally thrive on plant surfaces. A ternary cycle, beginning with intestinal waste, followed by mechanical distribution to and among plants, and return to the host via the oral cavity, is suggested.
TI  - Metabolism of biotin and analogues of biotin by microorganisms. IV. Degradation of biotin, oxybiotin, and desthiobiotin by Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Birnbaum, Jerome (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio), and Herman C. Lichstein. Metabolism of biotin and analogues of biotin by microorganisms. IV. Degradation of biotin, oxybiotin, and desthiobiotin by Lactobacillus casei. J. Bacteriol. 92:925-930. 1966.-Lactobacillus casei degrades biotin when it is present in excess to products not utilizable for growth by L. plantarum or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Degrading activity was initiated in the early stationary phase and was controlled by the pH of the medium. Nonproliferating cells, grown previously in excess biotin for 40 hr, metabolized oxybiotin and desthiobiotin as well as biotin. Cells grown in low biotin, or in excess biotin for 20 hr, did not degrade either analogue. Oxybiotin was 50% as active as biotin for growth, whereas desthiobiotin acted as a competitive inhibitor. Cells grown in excess biotin for 40 hr, but not 20 hr, overcame the inhibitory effect of desthiobiotin, when subcultured to media containing a normally inhibitory concentration of the analogue. Moreover, the level of desthiobiotin dropped rapidly during the first 4 to 6 hr before growth ensued. The data indicate that growth in excess biotin enables L. casei to degrade desthiobiotin and, thereby, to overcome the inhibitory effect of the analogue.
TI  - Folic acid involvement in cyclopropane fatty acid synthesis in lactobacilli.
AB  - Henderson, Thomas O. (North Carolina State University, Raleigh), John J. McNeill, and S. B. Tove. Folic acid involvement in cyclopropane fatty acid synthesis in lactobacilli. J. Bacteriol. 90:1283-1287. 1965.-Evidence for the involvement of folic acid in the synthesis of lactobacillic acid (11,12-methyleneoctadecanoic acid) was obtained with Lactobacillus plantarum and L. casei. L. plantarum, in the presence of aminopterin, incorporated 25% less radioactivity from methionine-methyl-C(14) into long-chain fatty acids than did control cultures, whereas the incorporation of acetate-1-C(14), representing overall fatty acid synthesis, was the same in both conditions. Control cultures of L. plantarum contained 3 to 4.5 times more lactobacillic acid than did aminopterin-grown cultures. Similarly, L. casei, in the presence of folic acid, synthesized six times more lactobacillic acid than did folic-deficient cultures. The results of this study indicate that coenzymes of the folic acid group are involved in the synthesis of lactobacillic acid in these organisms.
TI  - NATURE OF THE LIPIDS OF SOME LACTIC ACID BACTERIA.
AB  - Ikawa, Miyoshi (University of California, Berkeley). Nature of the lipids of some lactic acid bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 85:772-781. 1963.-Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus cerevisiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were grown on a lipid-free medium, and the amounts of acetone-soluble lipids, acetone-insoluble phospholipids, and unextracted or bound lipid in the cells were estimated. Neutral glycerides appeared to be absent, or present only in traces, in L. casei and S. faecalis. L. plantarum, L. mesenteroides, and P. cerevisiae, in addition to containing glycerides, appeared to contain glycolipids of glucose and galactose. Glycerol was present in the phospholipid fraction of all the organisms, and, in addition, galactose was present in L. mesenteroides. Paper chromatography of hydrolysates of the phospholipid fractions showed the absence of the usual phospholipid nitrogen bases, serine, ethanolamine, and choline, in these organisms. Microbiological assays of lyophilized unextracted cells for myo-inositol and choline also showed that lipids containing these components occurred in very small amounts at most. The principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the phospholipid fraction of L. casei, L. plantarum, P. cerevisiae, and S. faecalis was lysine, which seemed to be exclusively of the l configuration. The principal ninhydrin-reacting substance in the L. mesenteroides phospholipid fraction was d-alanine. These amino acids appeared to be bound in components of the phospholipid fraction and not free.
