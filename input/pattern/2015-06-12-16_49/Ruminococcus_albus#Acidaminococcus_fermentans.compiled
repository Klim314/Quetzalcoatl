TI  - Rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  - The maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus prevotii, 3% in Ruminococcus albus, 4% in Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptococcus niger and Megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in Peptococcus magnus. The biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
