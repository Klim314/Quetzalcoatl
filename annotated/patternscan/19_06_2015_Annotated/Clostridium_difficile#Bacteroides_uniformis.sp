TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == detection of bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin gene by pcr.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis constitutes about 1% of the bacterial flora in intestines of normal humans. enterotoxigenic strains of b. fragilis have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. the enterotoxin produced by these isolates induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal loops and an in vitro cytotoxic response in ht-29 cells. we developed a nested pcr to detect the enterotoxin gene of b. fragilis in stool specimens. after dna extraction, a 367-bp fragment was amplified with two outer primers. the amplicon from this reaction was subjected to a second round of amplification with a set of internal  primers. with these inner primers, a 290-bp dna fragment was obtained which was confirmed as part of the b. fragilis enterotoxin gene by southern blotting with a nonradioactive internal probe and a chemiluminescence system. by this approach, b. fragilis enterotoxin gene sequences were detected in eight known enterotoxigenic human isolates and nine enterotoxigenic horse isolates. no amplification products were obtained from dna extracted from 28 nonenterotoxigenic b. fragilis isolates or b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, b. ovatus, escherichia coli, or clostridium difficile. the sensitivity of this assay allowed us to detect as little as 1 pg of enterotoxin dna sequences or 100 to 1,000 cells of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis/g of stool. enterotoxin production of all isolates was confirmed in vitro in ht-29 cells. a 100% correlation was obtained between enterotoxin detection by cytotoxin assay and the nested pcr assay. this rapid and sensitive assay can be used to identify enterotoxigenic b. fragilis and may be used clinically to determine the role of b. fragilis in diarrheal diseases.

TI  == in vitro activity of flomoxef compared to moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and  clindamycin against anaerobes.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of flomoxef (6315-s), moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against anaerobes 197 clinical isolates (27 bacteroides fragilis, 42 b. thetaiotaomicron, 10 b. vulgatus, 7 b. ovatus, 6 b. uniformis, 6 b. distasonis, 7 bacteroides melaninogenicus group, 11 bacteroides oralis group, 21 clostridium difficile, 7 c. perfringens, 3 c. sporogenes, 3 clostridium spp., 33 propionibacterium acnes, 14 peptococcaceae) were studied by  means of agar dilution tests. the mic90 of b. fragilis was less than 2 micrograms/ml for flomoxef, less than 4 micrograms/ml for moxalactam, less than 16 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin, less than 128 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime and less than 2 micrograms/ml for clindamycin. the respective mic90's of b. thetaiotaomicron were less than 64, less than 128, less than 32, less than 256 and 8 micrograms/ml. strains of the other bacteroides species and groups were more susceptible to flomoxef and the other antibiotics than b. thetaiotaomicron.  against clostridium difficile flomoxef (mic90 less than 4 micrograms/ml) proved to be superior to the other agents tested. most of the clostridium strains other  than c. difficile were also susceptible to flomoxef; anaerobic grampositive cocci and propionibacterium acnes were very sensitive (mic90's less than 1 and less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml, respectively). its anti-anaerobic activity, together with its efficacy against aerobes, should make flomoxef a useful adjunct to the arsenal of modern antibiotic therapy.

TI  == variations in the anaerobic faecal flora of ten healthy human volunteers with special reference to the bacteroides fragilis-group and clostridium difficile.
AB  == ninety nine stool specimens of ten healthy human volunteers were collected over a one year period, and processed anaerobically. the individual variations in intestinal colonization with bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis-group were detected, using the bacteroides bile esculin medium and an identification scheme  for bile-resistant bacteroides species. clostridium difficile agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxtin was used to detect the incidence of c. difficile in this group. the species of the b. fragilis-group most often detected were: b. vulgatus (in 31 samples from ten persons), b. uniformis (22/9), b. fragilis (19/7). c. difficile was never detected in this group. the mean total anaerobic cultural counts (log) of the ten volunteers varied between 9.94 and 10.91. this shows that interindividual variations in anaerobic cultural counts of about one log are common. in spite of these moderate interindividual variations, intraindividual variations in time of up to three log were detected. the mean bacteroides cultural counts showed a variation between 8.83 and 10.24. the mean dmccs of the ten volunteers were between 10.22 and 10.73. we conclude that at least a three to four log difference from the control samples will be required to establish a significant change in anaerobic cultural count due to antibiotic treatment.
