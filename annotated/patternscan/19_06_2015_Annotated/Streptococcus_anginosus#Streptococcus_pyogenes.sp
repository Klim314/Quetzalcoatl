TI  == surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis). newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 33,688 staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (vgs), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) were included in this cross-susceptibility (dal versus vancomycin [van]) analysis as well as 4576  coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). isolates were collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program for the united states (usa) and europe (2011-2013). susceptibility testing followed clsi (m07-a9 and m100-s24) methods. usa food and drug administration (dal) and clsi (van) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between dal and van susceptibility results. a categorical agreement  (ca; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between dal and van when testing s.  aureus. only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against  van-susceptible isolates that displayed a dal-nonsusceptible (mic, 0.25 or 0.5mug/ml) phenotype. when susceptible mic correlations were analyzed against indicated bhs species (streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes), an overall ca rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. complete (100.0%) ca was documented  for s. pyogenes, as well as against all vgs isolates, including the indicated streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). in conclusion, high susceptible ca rates between dal and van were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in absssi. van-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by dal (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/ml.

TI  == streptolysin s of streptococcus anginosus exhibits broad-range hemolytic activity.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is a commensal of mucous membranes and an emerging human  pathogen. some strains, including the type strain, display a prominent beta-hemolytic phenotype. a gene cluster (sag), encoding a variant of streptolysin s (sls) has recently been identified as the genetic background for beta-hemolysin production in s. anginosus. in this study, we further characterized the hemolytic and cytolytic activity of the s. anginosus hemolysin  in comparison with other streptococcal hemolysins. the results indicate that sls  of s. anginosus is a broad-range hemolysin able to lyse erythrocytes of different species, including horse, bovine, rabbit and even chicken. the hemolytic activity is temperature dependent, and a down-regulation of the hemolysin expression is induced in the presence of high glucose levels. survival assays indicate that in  contrast to other streptococcal species, s. anginosus does not require sls for survival in the presence of human granulocytes. cross-complementation studies using the sagb and sagd genes of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis demonstrated functional similarities to the s. anginosus sls. nevertheless, distinct differences to other streptolysin s variants were noted and provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms of sls pathogen host interactions.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in european and us hospitals (2010-13).
AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == chromosomal islands of streptococcus pyogenes and related streptococci: molecular switches for survival and virulence.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a significant pathogen of humans, annually causing over 700,000,000 infections and 500,000 deaths. virulence in s. pyogenes is closely linked to mobile genetic elements like phages and chromosomal islands (ci). s. pyogenes phage-like chromosomal islands (spyci) confer a complex mutator phenotype on their host. spyci integrate into the 5' end of dna mismatch repair (mmr) gene mutl, which also disrupts downstream operon genes lmrp, ruva, and tag. during early logarithmic growth, spyci excise from the bacterial chromosome and replicate as episomes, relieving the mutator phenotype. as growth slows and the cells enter stationary phase, spyci reintegrate into the chromosome, again silencing the mmr operon. this system creates a unique growth-dependent and reversible mutator phenotype. additional ci using the identical attachment site in mutl have been identified in related species, including streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus parauberis, and streptococcus canis. these ci have small genomes, which range from 13 to 20 kb, conserved integrase and dna replication genes, and no identifiable genes encoding capsid proteins. spyci may  employ a helper phage for packaging and dissemination in a fashion similar to the staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (sapi). outside of the core replication and integration genes, spyci and related ci show considerable diversity with the presence of many indels that may contribute to the host cell phenotype or fitness. spyci are a subset of a larger family of streptococcal ci who potentially regulate the expression of other host genes. the biological and phylogenetic analysis of streptococcal chromosomal islands provides important clues as to how these chromosomal islands help s. pyogenes and other streptococcal species persist in human populations in spite of antibiotic therapy and immune challenges.

TI  == molecular analysis of streptococcus anginosus-derived saga peptides.
AB  == background: saga1 and saga2 molecules produced from beta-hemolytic streptococcus  anginosus subsp. anginosus are composed of a leader peptide and a propeptide, and their mature form has hemolytic activity as a well-known streptococcal peptide toxin, streptolysin. the function of these saga molecules is thought to be dependent on intra-molecular heterocycle formation. in this study, we examined the heterocycle-involved molecular features of saga1, saga2, and s. pyogenes saga (spysaga), focusing on their heterocycle formation. materials and methods: molecular models of saga1, saga2, and spysaga were constructed using a molecular  modeling technique. molecular dynamics and molecular mechanic analyses of the modeled saga molecules were performed to obtain their energy profiles. results: total energy of the modeled saga1, saga2, and spysaga decreased with heterocycle  formation, and the border between the leader peptide and propeptide was clearly observed after heterocycle formation. conclusion: the flexibility of saga molecules was changed by intramolecular heterocycle formation, and their function (e.g. hemolytic activity) seems to be regulated by structural transition with heterocycle formation.

TI  == microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients.
AB  == noma (cancrum oris) is a gangrenous disease of unknown etiology affecting the maxillo-facial region of young children in extremely limited resource countries.  in an attempt to better understand the microbiological events occurring during this disease, we used phylogenetic and low-density microarrays targeting the 16s  rrna gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing  gingivitis (ang) lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. our observations raise doubts about fusobacterium necrophorum, a previously suspected causative agent of noma, as this species was not associated with noma lesions. various oral pathogens were more abundant in noma lesions, notably atopobium spp., prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus anginosus. on the other hand, pathogens associated with periodontal diseases such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas spp. and fusobacteriales were more abundant in healthy controls. importantly, the overall loss of bacterial diversity observed in noma samples as well as its homology to that of ang microbiota supports the hypothesis that ang might be the  immediate step preceding noma.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == the epidemiology, antibiotic resistance and post-discharge course of peritonsillar abscesses in london, ontario.
AB  == background: peritonsillar abscesses (pta) are a common complication of tonsillitis. recent global epidemiological data regarding ptas have demonstrated  increasing antimicrobial resistance patterns. no similar studies have been conducted in canada and no canadian study has examined the post-discharge course  of treated patients. methods: a prospective observational study of the epidemiology, antibiotic resistance and post-discharge course of patients presenting with a peritonsillar abscess to the emergency department in london, ontario over one year. a follow-up telephone survey was conducted 2-3 weeks after abscess drainage. results: 60 patients were diagnosed with an abscess, giving an  incidence of 12/100,000. 46 patients were enrolled in the study; the average duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 6 days, with 51% treated with antibiotics prior to presentation. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus anginosus were present in 56% of isolates and of those, 7/23 (32%) of specimens demonstrated resistance to clindamycin. eight patients were treated with clindamycin and had a culture that was resistant, yet only one had recurrence. telephone follow-up was possible for 38 patients: 51% of patients reported a return to solid food within 2 days, and 75% reported no pain by 5 days. resolution of trismus took a week or longer for 51%. interpretation: clindamycin  resistance was identified in a third of streptococcus isolates, which should be taken into account when prescribing antibiotics. routine culture appears unnecessary as patients recover quickly from outpatient drainage and empiric therapy, with less pain than expected, but trismus takes time to resolve.

TI  == identification of beta-haemolysin-encoding genes in streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is an emerging pathogen, but little is known about its virulence factors. to detect the genes responsible for beta-haemolysis we performed genomic mutagenesis of the beta-haemolytic s. anginosus type strain atcc 12395 using the vector pghost9:iss1. integration site analysis of 15 non-haemolytic mutants identified a gene cluster with high homology to the genes  of the streptolysin s (sls) encoding sag gene cluster of s. pyogenes. the gene cluster harbours 10 open reading frames displaying significant similarities to the s. pyogenes genes saga-sagi, with the identities on protein level ranging from 38 to 87%. complementation assays of s. anginosus sagb and sagd integration  mutants with the respective genes confirmed their importance for beta-haemolysin  production and suggest the presence of post-translational modifications in s. anginosus sls similar to sls of s. pyogenes. characterization of the s. anginosus haemolysin in comparison to the s. pyogenes sls showed that the haemolysin is surface bound, but in contrast to s. pyogenes neither fetal calf serum nor rna was able to stabilize the haemolysin of s. anginosus in culture supernatants. inhibition of beta-haemolysis by polyethylene glycol of different sizes was carried out, giving no evidence of a pore-forming haemolytic mechanism. analysis  of a whole genome shotgun sequence of streptococcus constellatus, a closely related streptococcal species that belongs to the s. anginosus group, revealed a  similar sag gene cluster. employing a genomic mutagenesis strategy we were able to determine an sls encoding gene cluster in s. anginosus and demonstrate its importance for beta-haemolysin production in s. anginosus.

TI  == impact of identification of streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis from throat cultures in an adult population.
AB  == streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (sdse) are isolated from the throat of patients with pharyngitis, although the clinical significance remains debated. we sought to determine the incidence and association with pharyngitis of sdse in an adult veteran population. organisms were phenotypically identified to  subspecies and lancefield group, with selective 16s rrna gene sequencing. from 833 throat cultures, the overall frequency of sdse was 3.4% (64% group c and 36%  group g) as compared to 8.6% for s. pyogenes (gas). sdse was described as a large colony in only 29% of the original culture evaluations by bench technologists, and clinical symptoms were similar for gas and sdse. laboratory algorithms that are limited to identification of only gas or are based on lancefield group or visual identification of "large-colony type" beta hemolytic lancefield group c and g streptococci may be missing or misidentifying sdse along with anginosus group streptococci.

TI  == novel twin streptolysin s-like peptides encoded in the sag operon homologue of beta-hemolytic streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is a member of the anginosus group streptococci, which form part of the normal human oral flora. in contrast to the pyogenic group streptococci, our knowledge of the virulence factors of the anginosus group streptococci, including s. anginosus, is not sufficient to allow a clear understanding of the basis of their pathogenicity. generally, hemolysins are thought to be important virulence factors in streptococcal infections. in the present study, a sag operon homologue was shown to be responsible for beta-hemolysis in s. anginosus strains by random gene knockout. interestingly, contrary to pyogenic group streptococci, beta-hemolytic s. anginosus was shown to have two tandem saga homologues, encoding streptolysin s (sls)-like peptides, in  the sag operon homologue. gene deletion and complementation experiments revealed  that both genes were functional, and these sls-like peptides were essential for beta-hemolysis in beta-hemolytic s. anginosus. furthermore, the amino acid sequence of these sls-like peptides differed from that of the typical sls of s. pyogenes, especially in their propeptide domain, and an amino acid residue indicated to be important for the cytolytic activity of sls in s. pyogenes was deleted in both s. anginosus homologues. these data suggest that sls-like peptides encoded by two saga homologues in beta-hemolytic s. anginosus may be potential virulence factors with a different structure essential for hemolytic activity and/or the maturation process compared to the typical sls present in pyogenic group streptococci.

TI  == [problems with identification of beta-hemolytic streptococcus resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis].
AB  == introduction: the genus streptococcus comprises a number of species characterized by a differential pathogenic potential. these bacteria can be considered as members of microbial physiological flora but they can also cause mild infections  or severe, life threatening conditions. the majority of infections of streptococcal etiology are caused by beta-hemolysing species. the predominant causative agent of bacterial pharyngitis is streptococcus pyogenes. this species  usually doesn't give rise to any identification difficulties due to the introduction the well determined diagnostic schemes. problems concerning laboratory identification can be, however, associated with other species of beta-hemolysing streptococci isolated from patients with pharyngitis. these streptococci can demonstrate features similar to those of s. pyogenes and share the group antygen a, such as some strains of streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the determination of sensitivity to bacitracin, which is a feature typical of s. pyogenes, is the basic test useful for its preliminary identification. nevertheless, the identification of some strains by this test can give rise to incompatibility. the aim of the study  was characterisation of beta-hemolysing streptococci resistant to bacitracin isolated from patients with pharyngitis. the examined bacterial strains caused identification problems by the use of routine diagnostic methods. methods: the material included 14 streptococcal strains resistant to bacitracin which were isolated from adult patients suffering from pharyngitis. the bacteria were cultured on media dedicated for the species. the following routine diagnostic tests were used for the bacterial identification: sensitivity to bacitracin (0.04 u/disc), camp test, determination of the group antigens a, b, c, d, f and g (slidex strepto-kit), and determination of biochemical features by the api 20 strep test (biomerieux). the sensitivity of streptococcal isolates to antibiotics (penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, vancomycin, ofloxacin) and  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, was determined by the disc diffusion method on the mueller-hinton agar with 5% sheep blood (the inoculum-0.5 mcfarland). results: among the 14 isolates resistant to bacitracin, 6 isolates of s. pyogenes, 6 isolates of s. constellatus, and 2 isolates of s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis were identified. all isolates were sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin. one isolate ofs. pyogenes demonstrated constitutive mlsb resistance mechanism. seven  isolates were resistant to tetracycline: s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (3 isolates), s. constellatus (3), and s. pyogenes (1). the number of isolates resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was as follows: s. pyogenes (6) and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (1), whereas four isolates were resistant to ofloxacin. conclusions: the bacitracin test cannot be used as the only test for the laboratory identification of s. pyogenes even if it is combined with the determination of the lancefield group antigen due to the existence of bacitracin  resistant s. pyogenes strains. therefore, it is necessary to perform biochemical  commercial tests in addition to routine phenotypic tests. isolation of beta-hemolysing streptococci other than s. pyogenes from patients with pharyngitis confirms their role in the etiology of this infection. taken into account the significance of determination of sensitivity to bacitracin for the preliminary identification of s. pyogenes, it is necessary to standardize this test, which will make obtaining of the comparability of results possible.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == acute glomerulonephritis associated with streptococcus pyogenes with concomitant  spread of streptococcus constellatus in four rural families.
AB  == we studied history, renal histopathology and microbiology of an epidemic of acute glomerulonephritis associated with throat infections and uncommon culture results in four neighbour families. a 40-year-old man (index patient) was referred to a university hospital for dialysis and kidney biopsy due to a suspected acute glomerulonephritis. an acute tonsillitis had preceded the condition. penicillin treatment had been started four days before the discovery of renal failure. throat swabs were positive for beta-hemolytic streptococci, group c (gcs). gcs were also found in throat cultures from his wife and two of their children. the bacteria were typed as streptococcus constellatus. a third child had s. constellatus expressing lancefield antigen group g. a neighbour and two of his children fell ill the following week with renal involvement. throat swabs from both these children were positive for s. constellatus. his third child had erythema multiforme and s. constellatus in the throat while a fourth child had beta-hemolytic streptococci group a; streptococcus pyogenes. kidney biopsies on the index patient and his neighbour showed an acute diffuse prolipherative glomerulonephritis compatible with acute post-streptococcal nephritis and microbiological analysis of renal tissue revealed in both cases s. pyogenes and s. constellatus. the families had had much contact and had consumed unpasteurized milk from our index patient's farm. in four of seven persons in two additional neighbouring families s. constellatus was found in throat swabs during the same month while two persons carried streptococcus anginosus expressing the lancefield c antigen. in conclusion spread of s. constellatus coincided with the occurrence  of four cases of acute glomerulonephritis. the two biopsied patients had both s.  pyogenes and s. constellatus present in renal tissue. the epidemic either suggested that the outbreak of glomerulonephritis was due to s. pyogenes but coincided with the transmission and colonization of s. constellatus or that the s. constellatus strains were highly pathogenic or nephritogenic and that this organism can be transmitted in such cases.

AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == the purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal g. vaginalis  in both genders. from a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with  a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. at least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). s. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. g. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == cross-reactivity between human sialyl lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.

TI  == immunodominant antigens of streptococcus equisimilis shared by other beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  == three immunodominant antigens of streptococcus equisimilis (lancefield group c) with approximate mol. wts of 46, 66 and 105 kda were recognised by human serum igg and iga immunoblotting. these antigens were identified consistently by various human sera but immunoblots with iga (heavy chain) and secretory iga (j chain) from human respiratory secretions gave more variable results. antigens with similar migration rates were demonstrated in s.pyogenes, large colony human  biotype group g streptococci, and streptococci of groups c and g from the "s. anginosus-milleri group". polyclonal antibody which was eluted from immunoblot substrates that contained the s. equisimilis 66-kda antigen reacted with the 60-kda antigen of s. pyogenes. both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-vimentin antibodies identified the 46-kda and 66-kda antigens of s. equisimilis. the homology of these antigens among beta-haemolytic streptococci has the potential to complicate both a strategy for the utilisation of immunoblotting for diagnostic purposes and the understanding of how such antigens may be involved in the pathogenesis of post-infectious sequelae.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == role of group c beta-hemolytic streptococci in pharyngitis: epidemiologic study of clinical features associated with isolation of group c streptococci.
AB  == all lancefield group c beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated over 12 months from college students with clinical pharyngitis and age-matched healthy controls were  identified. clinical features of upper respiratory tract infection and pyogenic pharyngitis as well as colony counts were tabulated for each patient according to throat culture results. of 1,480 patients, lancefield group c streptococcus equisimilis was isolated from 45 (3%) patients and streptococcus anginosus ("streptococcus milleri") was isolated from 164 (11.1%) patients. patients from whom s. equisimilis was isolated had clinical features more suggestive of pyogenic infection than did patients from whom s. anginosus was isolated. colony  counts on primary throat culture plates from patients from whom s. equisimilis and streptococcus pyogenes were isolated were higher than those from patients from whom s. anginosus was isolated. this study presents epidemiologic evidence supporting a role for s. equisimilis in causing pharyngeal infection and for s. anginosus as representing part of the normal oropharyngeal flora.

TI  == bactericidal titers of loracarbef (ly 163892) in serum and killing rates in volunteers receiving 400 versus 200 milligrams.
AB  == in a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (ly 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. mean +/- standard error of the  mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). other species (branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus anginosus, staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/mic ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the mic. our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == surface-associated properties of streptococcus milleri group strains and their potential relation to pathogenesis.
AB  == thirty strains from the streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (smg) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes. the smg strains were heterogeneous in all tests. most (18) belonged to one of the lancefield groups with group f predominating. adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). compared with strains of s. sanguis, smg strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. they differed from the type strain of s. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for s. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than  0.001). the ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. the amount of fibronectin bound by smg strains  correlated with their ability to adhere to sha (p less than 0.001). the hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. a minority of strains possessed  a net positive cell-surface charge. neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to sha. strains of smg co-aggregated weakly with strains of veillonella parvula, v. dispar, actinomyces  viscosus and a. naeslundii.
