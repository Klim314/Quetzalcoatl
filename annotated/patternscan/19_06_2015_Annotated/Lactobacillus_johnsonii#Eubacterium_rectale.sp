TI  == ecophysiology of the developing total bacterial and lactobacillus communities in  the terminal small intestine of weaning piglets.
AB  == weaning of the pig is generally regarded as a stressful event which could lead to clinical implications because of the changes in the intestinal ecosystem. the functional properties of microbiota inhabiting the pig's small intestine (si), including lactobacilli which are assumed to exert health-promoting properties, are yet poorly described. thus, we determined the ecophysiology of bacterial groups and within genus lactobacillus in the si of weaning piglets and the impact of dietary changes. the si contents of 20 piglets, 4 killed at weaning (only sow  milk and no creep feed) and 4 killed at 1, 2, 5, and 11 days post weaning (pw; cereal-based diet) were examined for bacterial cell count and bacterial metabolites by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). lactobacilli were the predominant group in the si except at 1 day pw because of a marked reduction in their number. on day 11 pw, bifidobacteria and e. coli were not detected, and enterobacteriaceae and members of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale cluster were only found occasionally. l. sobrius/l. amylovorus became dominant species whereas the abundance of l. salivarius and l. gasseri/johnsonii declined. concentration of lactic acid increased pw whereas ph, volatile fatty acids, and ammonia decreased. carbohydrate utilization of 76 lactobacillus spp. isolates was studied revealing a shift from lactose and galactose to starch, cellobiose, and xylose, suggesting that the bacteria colonizing the si of piglets adapt to the newly introduced nutrients during the early weaning period. identification of isolates based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence data and comparison with fermentation data furthermore suggested adaptation processes below the species level. the results of our study will help to understand intestinal bacterial ecophysiology and to develop nutritional regimes to prevent or counteract complications during the weaning transition.

TI  == modulation of the fecal microbiota by the intake of a lactobacillus johnsonii la1-containing product in human volunteers.
AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (la1) is a probiotic strain capable of stimulating the immune system of the host and interfering with gastrointestinal pathogens. this study evaluates how the ingestion of different amounts of la1 influences the main bacterial populations of the fecal microbiota. eight asymptomatic volunteers participated in the study. after a basal period, they ingested daily 100 ml of a  product containing 10(8) cfu ml(-1) of la1 during the first week, 200 ml during the second week and 500 ml during the third week. fecal samples were obtained at  the end of each period and subsequently during 7 weeks. lactobacilli were determined by culture on mrs agar and la1 colonies were confirmed by eric-pcr. the main populations of fecal bacteria were identified by fish and flow cytometry. at baseline, 37.7% of the total fluorescent bacteria were eubacterium  rectale, 18.3% fusobacterium prausnitzii, 13.2% bacteroides, 8.6% atopobium, 2.30%, clostridium histolyticum, 2.05% bifidobacterium and 0.95% lactobacillus. fecal excretion of la1 increased during the intake period and decreased during the post-ingestion period, so that no la1 was observed in the stools of the volunteers seven weeks after the intake product has been finished. la1 intake increased the populations of c. histolyticum (p=0.049), lactobacillus (p=0.056) and bifidobacterium (p=0.067), and decreased those of f. prausnitzii (p=0.005) while it did not affect bacteroides, e. rectale and atopobium populations. these  bacterial populations returned to their baseline levels during the post-ingestion period. the regular intake of a la1-containing product beneficially affects the homeostasis of the human fecal microbiota, probably contributing to the health-promoting effects of this probiotic.
