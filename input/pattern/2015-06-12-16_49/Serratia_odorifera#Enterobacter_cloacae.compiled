TI  - Fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community setting in Casablanca.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of community-acquired infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) has been increasingly recognized in recent years. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community in Casablanca, Morocco. METHODS: During 6 months (2013), 93 fecal samples were examined for ESBL-PE. Isolates expressing an ESBL phenotype were investigated for the presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Conjugation experiments were done to determine the mobility of ESBL genes. RESULTS: The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL-PE was 4.3% (4/93; 95% CI, 0.2-8.4). Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), and Serratia odorifera (n = 1) were the ESBL-producing species. Four (66.7%) of these isolates were multidrug-resistant. The blaSHV-12 (n = 5) was the most frequent ESBL gene detected, followed by blaCTX-M-15 (n = 3).The non-ESBL gene detected was blaTEM-1 (n = 5). One isolate harbored the qnrB1 variant. RESULTS of conjugation experiments indicated that blaSHV-12 + blaTEM-1 + qnrB1 and blaCTX-M-15 + blaTEM-1 genes were co-transferred and that these genes were carried by a conjugative plasmid of high molecular weight (125 kb). CONCLUSION: Our results show the importance of the intestinal tract as a reservoir for ESBL-PE in the community in Morocco.
TI  - The Disinfecting Potential of Contact Lens Soutions used by Sultan Qaboos University Students.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the disinfecting potential of some contact lens solutions used by some university students in Oman. METHODS: This work was carried out from January to June 2010 in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University, Oman. Fifty disinfecting solutions, in which contact lenses were disinfected according to the manufacturers' instructions, were collected from the students and plated on various microbiological culture media. Bacterial isolates were identified by API-20E, API-20NE and Phoenix automated systems while fungi were identified by their cultural characteristics and biochemistry. RESULTS: From 98 isolates, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 23.5%; Penicillium, 13%; Candida species, 9.2%; coagulase negative staphylococci, 9.2%; Serratia marcescens, 6.1%; Bacillus, 5.1%; Aspergillus flavus, 5.1%; Serratia liquefaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Aspergillus niger, 4.1% each; Chryseomonas luteola and Chryseomonas indologenes, 3.1% each; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia odorifera, 2.0% each; Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1% each. Most isolates (65%) came from polyhexanide containing solutions. CONCLUSION: Contact lens disinfecting solutions with the same formulations, but manufactured by different companies, possessed different disinfecting potentials.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon: public health implications.
AB  - Increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. Unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. Microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. Fish is a major source of protein in Cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. In this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of fish from the Limbe and Tiko beaches in South West Cameroon from May to October 2007. We isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. Data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. Eleven bacterial species were identified, including Escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), Citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), Proteus vulgaris (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), Klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), Klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), Serratia marcescens (4.8%), Serratia odorifera (4.8%), Hafnia alvei (4.4%) and Proteus penneri (2.9%). More contaminated fish were found at Limbe beach than at Tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). When ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). Ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. Almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. The results of our study demonstrate that fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.
TI  - Monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Protected Denomination of Origin Portuguese semihard cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. Standard plate counts (log CFU per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. Species identified within this family encompassed Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Escherichia coli; Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella terrigena, and Serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. No Salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. Viable counts of Micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. Species identified within this family encompassed Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and Staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). Accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and pH. Statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of Micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and moisture content than between viable numbers and pH. The results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the indicators total mesophile and Enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100- and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. However, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4 months of ripening), Sao Jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus, as well as absence of Salmonella.
TI  - [Utility of pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase detection for typing Enterobacteriaceae and  non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - Detection of pyrrolidonyl-aryl-amidase activity (PYR) is an important tool to identify gram-positive cocci, such as staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, and other related genera. However, only few studies evaluating its usefulness with gram-negative rods have been published. Thus, a prospective study including 542 and 215 unique clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative gram-negative rods, respectively, was undertaken. Strains were identified by conventional methods. PYR test was performed using a commercial kit, according to the manufacturer recommendations. Positive results were uniformly obtained for the PYR test with the following species: Citrobacter spp, Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans group, Serratia marcescens and S. odorifera. On the other hand, negative results were uniformly displayed by E. coli (including inactive E. coli), Protease group, Salmonellia spp, Shigella spp, Acinetobacter spp, Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia and Flavobacterium spp. Variable results were shown in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) malthophilia, Kluyvera cryocrescens, and Enterobacter cloacae. PYR test proved to be a reliable and simple tool to rapidly distinguish certain species belonging to Enterobacteriaceae (ie. Citrobacter freundii from Salmonella spp, and inactive E. coli from K. ozaenae). Further studies, including a wide diversity of species, are required to assess usefulness of the PYR test for the identification of non-fermentative gram-negative rods.
TI  - Evaluation of RapID onE system for identification of 379 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  - The ability of the RapID onE system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Norcross, Ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. Kits were inoculated with no. 2 McFarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C. Overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas and non-Shigella sonnei Shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional tests. For four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included one Serratia liquefaciens (Serratia marcescens or Serratia liquefaciens), one Serratia rubidaea (Serratia rubidaea or Serratia odorifera), one Salmonella typhi (Leminorella richardii or Salmonella sp.) and one Yersinia enterocolitica (Yersinia frederiksenii, Yersinia intermedia, or Yersinia enterocolitica). Twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these comprised one Citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three Enterobacter hormaechei (not in the RapID onE database; two Enterobacter amnigenus, one Enterobacter sp.), one Serratia liquefaciens (Enterobacter cloacae), one Serratia rubidaea (no identification), four Serratia fonticola (not in RapID onE database; two Enterobacter aerogenes, one Serratia marcescens, one not identified), one Proteus mirabilis (Proteus penneri), and one Proteus vulgaris (Providencia rustigianii). If the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. The RapID onE system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
