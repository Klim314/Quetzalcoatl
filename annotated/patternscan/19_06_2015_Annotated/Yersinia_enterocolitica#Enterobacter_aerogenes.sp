TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in  combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml)  and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to  reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.

TI  == hypoxia-independent activation of hif-1 by enterobacteriaceae and their siderophores.
AB  == background & aims: hypoxia inducible factor-1 (hif-1) is the key transcriptional  regulator during adaptation to hypoxia. recent studies provide evidence for hif-1 activation during bacterial infections. however, molecular details of how bacteria activate hif-1 remain unclear. here, we pursued the role of bacterial siderophores in hif-1 activation during infection with enterobacteriaceae. methods: in vivo, hif-1 activation and hif-1-dependent gene induction in peyer's  patches were analyzed after orogastric infection with yersinia enterocolitica. the course of an orogastric y enterocolitica infection was determined using mice  with a deletion of hif-1alpha in the intestine. in vitro, the mechanism of hif-1  activation was analyzed in infections with y enterocolitica, salmonella enterica  subsp enterica, and enterobacter aerogenes. results: infection of mice with y enterocolitica led to functional activation of hif-1 in peyer's patches. because  mice with deletion of hif-1alpha in the intestinal epithelium showed a significantly higher susceptibility to orogastric y enterocolitica infections, bacterial hif-1 activation appears to represent a host defense mechanism. additional studies with y enterocolitica, s enterica subsp enterica, or e aerogenes, and, moreover, application of their siderophores (yersiniabactin, salmochelin, aerobactin) caused a robust, dose-dependent hif-1 response in human  epithelia and endothelia, independent of cellular hypoxia. hif-1 activation occurs most likely because of inhibition of prolylhydroxylase activity and is abolished upon infection with siderophore uptake deficient bacteria. conclusions: taken together, this study reveals what we believe to be a previously unrecognized role of bacterial siderophores for hypoxia-independent activation of hif-1 during infection with human pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activity of the centipeda minima (asteraceae).
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the centipeda minima l. (asteraceae) extract was evaluated against seven microorganisms using the disc diffusion method. the extract showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against all the tested  bacterial strains, especially enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. the chemical composition of the extract obtained from centipeda minima was analysed by gc-ms. twentythree compounds, constituting about 84.75 % of the total extract, were identified. the  main constituents were palmitic acid (7.47%), (z,z)-9-,12-octadecatrienoic acid (6.52%), (z,z,z)-9-,12-octadecatrienoic acid (7.01%), phytol (7.01%), naptho[2.3-b]furan-2-(3h)-on (6.21%), 1-(1,2,3,4,7,7a-hexahydro-1,4,4,5-tetramethyl-1,3a-ethano-3ah-inden-6-yl)etanon (7.95%), 1,3,5-tri-tertbutyl- benzene (4.52%), (3z)-2-methyl-3-octen-2-ol (5.95%) and artemisia ketone (4.98%). the extract was also tested against brine shrimp for toxicity. there was no significant toxicity as it only recorded a lc50 value  of 4.92 mg/ml. the study shows that the extract is a good antimicrobial agent with potential applications in public health against diseases.

TI  == the inner-core lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic waae gene: function and genetic distribution among some enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == to determine the function of the waae gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  lps of klebsiella pneumoniae, a waae non-polar mutant has been constructed. data  obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of lps samples obtained from the  wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waae gene is involved in substitution of alpha-l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose i  (l,d-heppi) at the o-4 position by a beta-d-glucopyranose (beta-d-glcp) residue.  in addition, dna amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waae homologues located between the waaa and coad genes are present in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi (k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes of unknown lps-core structures. complementation studies using non-polar waae mutants prove that all the waae homologues perform the same  function. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, ser. marcescens and p. mirabilis non-polar  waae mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. in addition, the ser. marcescens and p. murabilis waae mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. all these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waae gene independently of its origin. an easy dna amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi] in the inner-core lps of enterobacteriaceae members with unknown lps-core structures.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == phylogenetic relationships of salmonella based on dna sequence comparison of atpd encoding the beta subunit of atp synthase.
AB  == dna sequences covering 57% of atpd encoding the beta subunit of atp synthase were determined for 16 strains of salmonella enterica, two strains of s. bongori, and  one strain each of citrobacter freundii and yersinia enterocolitica, and comparison was made with the published escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes sequences. the phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood analysis showed separation of the subspecies of s. enterica except for two serotypes of subspecies ii which were unsupported by a common node. the two serotypes of s. bongori were separated from s. enterica and related to the serotypes of subspecies ii. a tight relationship was found between s. enterica subspecies iiia consisting of monophasic serotypes and subspecies iiib consisting of diphasic serotypes. this is in conflict with results obtained for most other housekeeping  genes and the 23s rrna gene separating mono- from diphasic subspecies.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
