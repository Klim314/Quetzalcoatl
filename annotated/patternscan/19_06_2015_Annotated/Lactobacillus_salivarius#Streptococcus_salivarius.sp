TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB  == background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between  breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus  bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%)  and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius,  and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.

TI  == microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  == awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. in this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. monocultures of klebsiella oxytoca and lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas streptococcus mitis and s. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. yet, neither s. oralis or s. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from k. oxytoca on wound healing. other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. further mechanistic experiments with k. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. these results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.

TI  == oral lactic acid bacteria related to the occurrence and/or progression of dental  caries in japanese preschool children.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab), especially those classified into the genus lactobacillus, is associated with the progression of dental caries in preschool children. nevertheless, the kinds of species of lab and the characteristics that are important for dental caries have been unclear. the aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the distribution of oral lab among japanese preschool children with various prevalence levels of caries; and (2) to reveal the characteristics of these isolated lab species. seventy-four japanese preschool children were examined for  caries scores and caries progression, and their dental cavity samples were collected for lab isolation and identification. the saliva-induced agglutination  rate and the resistance to acidic environments of the identified strains were measured. statistical analysis showed that preschool children carrying lactobacillus (l.) salivarius or streptococcus mutans have a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries, the growth ability in acidic environments correlates with the caries scores of individuals with l. salivarius, and the caries scores exhibit positive correlation with saliva-induced agglutination in l. salivarius.  these results show that specific lactobacillus species are associated with dental caries based on the level of carious lesion severity. the present study suggests  that these specific lactobacillus species, especially those with easily agglutinated properties and acid resistance, affect the dental caries scores of preschool children, and that these properties may provide useful information for  research into the prevention of dental caries.

TI  == effect of probiotic containing ice-cream on salivary mutans streptococci (sms) levels in children of 6-12 years of age: a randomized controlled double blind study with six-months follow up.
AB  == introduction: to evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5. materials and methods: a double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft). they were randomly divided into two equal groups. saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline  data. for the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as a and b. saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. results: on statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). there was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. after six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. conclusion: probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. the dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial properties of three mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine against oral microbial plaques: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the mouth provides an environment that allows the colonization and growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, especially bacteria. one of the most  effective ways to reduce oral microorganisms is using mouthwashes. objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes (manufacture by livar, behsa, boht) on common oral microorganisms. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, isolated colonies  of four bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguinis, s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei, were prepared for an antimicrobial mouth rinse test. the tube dilution method was used for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). results: the  mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.14, 0.48 and 1000 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. mutans, respectively. the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.23, 1.9 and 2000 micrograms/ml for s. mutans, respectively. the mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.073, 0.48 and 250 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. sanguinis, respectively.  the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.14, 1.9 and 1000 micrograms/ml for  s. sanguinis, respectively. conclusions: the kin gingival chlorhexidine mouthwash has a greater effect than behsa and boht mouthwashes on oral microorganisms and is recommended to be used for plaque chemical inhibition.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == antifouling coatings for dental implants: polyethylene glycol-like coatings on titanium by plasma polymerization.
AB  == titanium dental implants are commonly used for the replacement of lost teeth, but they present a considerable number of failures due to the infection on surrounding tissues. the aim of this paper is the development of a polyethylene glycol-like (peg-like) coating on the titanium surface by plasma polymerization to obtain a novel improved surface with suitable low bacterial adhesion and adequate cell response. surface analysis data of these coatings are presented, in particular, water contact angle, surface roughness, and film chemistry, demonstrating the presence of a peg-like coating. streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius bacterial adhesion assays showed a decreased adhesion on the plasma polymerized samples, while cell adhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts on the treated surfaces was similar to control surfaces. thus, the peg-like antifouling coating obtained by plasma polymerization on ti confers this biomaterial's highly suitable properties for dental applications, as they reduce  the possibility of infection while allowing the tissue integration around the implant.

TI  == antibacterial properties of hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces: a comparison  study between silanization and surface initiated polymerization.
AB  == dental implant failure can be associated with infections that develop into peri-implantitis. in order to reduce biofilm formation, several strategies focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been studied. to covalently immobilize these molecules onto metallic substrates, several techniques have been developed, including silanization and polymer brush prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp), with varied peptide binding yield and antibacterial performance. the aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of these methods to immobilize the lactoferrin-derived hlf1-11 antibacterial peptide onto titanium, and evaluate their antibacterial activity in vitro. smooth titanium samples were coated with hlf1-11 peptide under three different conditions: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (aptes), and polymer brush based coatings with two different silanes. peptide presence was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the mechanical stability of the coatings was studied under ultrasonication. the ldh assays confirmed that hffs viability and proliferation were no affected by the treatments. the in vitro antibacterial properties of the  modified surfaces were tested with two oral strains (streptococcus sanguinis and  lactobacillus salivarius) showing an outstanding reduction. a higher decrease in  bacterial attachment was noticed when samples were modified by atrp methods compared to silanization. this effect is likely due to the capacity to immobilize more peptide on the surfaces using polymer brushes and the nonfouling nature of polymer pdma segment.

TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == the probiotic vsl#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for crohn's disease.
AB  == background & aims: probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of crohn's disease after surgery. we  investigated the ability of vsl#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of vsl#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of lactobacillus, 3 strains of bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence  at day 90 received vsl#3 until day 365. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. results: at day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between vsl#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, p = .19). the proportions  of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 from days 90 through 365) (p = .09). aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early vsl#3 group and  42.1% in the late vsl#3 group. patients receiving vsl#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (p < .05). crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. conclusions: there were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received vsl#3 and patients who received placebo. lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early vsl#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for  prevention of crohn's disease recurrence. clinical trials.gov number: nct00175292.

TI  == cariogenic bacteria and dental health status in adolescents: the role of oral health behaviours.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the association between dental health status and levels of cariogenic bacteria in teenagers and the influence of behaviours and socio-demographic background on levels of bacteria. materials and methods: study  design: a cross-sectional population-based sample of 13-year-old adolescents (112 females and 78 males, total 190) was examined. the number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs), plaque and hygiene index were recorded according to the who criteria. the saliva samples were collected in a sterile container and then analysed by culture on mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar for mutans streptococci and on man rogosa sharp (mrs) agar for lactobacilli. the levels of bacteria were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per millilitre of saliva (cfu/ml). associations between levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and dental health were estimated by odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) using unconditional logistic regression. results: no mutans streptococci were detected in 53.2% of the adolescents but 22.6% presented >/= 10(3) cfu/ml. for lactobacilli, these values were, respectively 43.7% and 34.7%. after adjustment for gender and social class, the or (95% ci) for dmfs >5  was 8.66 (3.57-21.02) if mutans streptococci >/= 10(3) cfu and 2.11 (0.96-4.64) if lactobacilli >/= 10(3) cfu. conclusion: this data allow us to conclude that hygiene habits and dental visits are not associated with high levels of cariogenic bacteria, but high scores of dmfs were found in adolescents with high  levels of mutans streptococci and lower parents' education.

TI  == treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of lactobacillus  salivarius ls01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  == goals: to evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by streptococcus thermophilus st10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (ad). background: previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in ad symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain l. salivarius ls01. s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. study: a prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum  could improve the activity of l. salivarius ls01 administered at high doses to adults with ad. twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. scoring atopic dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. results: a significant improvement in scorad index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. a slight decrease in fecal s. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. conclusions: data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for l. salivarius ls01 in the treatment of ad. the addition of tara gum and s. thermophilus st10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.

TI  == functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. foodborne lab have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (ar) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. we have previously reported isolation of ar lab from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while ar genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by pcr amplification, thus pointing at the need for  more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. we turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial dna extracted directly from the food matrix. to maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total dna extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus genomes. we report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer ar phenotype to recipient bacteria. we also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. survival of e. coli o157:h7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain e. coli o157:h7 cocktail (7 log(10) cfu/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% nacl brine at 10 and 21 masculinec for 28 d. nacl concentration, water activity (a(w)), ph,  and numbers of e. coli o157:h7 and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were determined in  cheese and brine. e. coli o157:h7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculinec regardless of the presence of starter lab, although the latter significantly enhanced e. coli o157:h7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculinec. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) cfu/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% nacl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter lab and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of starter lab at 10 masculinec. the pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. the salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the nacl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. values of ph and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus salivarius on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == dental caries arises from an imbalance of metabolic activities in dental biofilms developed primarily by streptococcus mutans. this study was conducted to isolate  potential oral probiotics with antagonistic activities against s. mutans biofilm  formation from lactobacillus salivarius, frequently found in human saliva. we analysed 64 l. salivarius strains and found that two, k35 and k43, significantly  inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation with inhibitory activities more pronounced  than those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), a prototypical probiotic that shows anti-caries activity. scanning electron microscopy showed that co-culture of s. mutans with k35 or k43 resulted in significantly reduced amounts of attached bacteria and network-like structures, typically comprising exopolysaccharides. spot assay for s. mutans indicated that k35 and k43 strains possessed a stronger bactericidal activity against s. mutans than lgg. moreover,  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases, gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd was reduced when s. mutans were co-cultured with k35 or k43. however, lgg activated the expression of gtfb and gtfc, but did not influence the expression of gtfd in the co-culture. a  transwell-based biofilm assay indicated that these lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation in a contact-independent manner. in conclusion, we identified two l. salivarius strains with inhibitory activities on the growth and expression of s. mutans virulence genes to reduce its biofilm formation. this is  not a general characteristic of the species, so presents a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.

TI  == propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  == varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. in dentistry they are used to prevent caries. in this study we developed  a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria.  to a chitosan polymeric base (chv) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: pv1 (5%), pv2 (10%), and pv3 (15%). antimicrobial activity was carried out against streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguinis (sg), streptococcus salivarius (ss), and lactobacillus casei (lc) through agar diffusion method. the three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. cytotoxicity assay was done by mtt method. data were analyzed by one-way anova and bonferroni  test. none of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while chv allowed cellular proliferation (120%). sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu l of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. according to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was pv3 (8 weeks). varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).

TI  == silver deposition on titanium surface by electrochemical anodizing process reduces bacterial adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial properties of silver-doped titanium surfaces prepared with a novel electrochemical anodizing process. material and methods: titanium samples were anodized with a pulsed process in a solution of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulphate at room temperature with stirring. samples were processed with different electrolyte concentrations and treatment cycles to improve silver deposition. physicochemical properties were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, white-light interferometry, and scanning electron microscopy. cellular cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts was studied with lactate dehydrogenase assays. the in vitro effect of treated surfaces on two oral bacteria strains (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) was studied with viable bacterial adhesion measurements and growth curve assays. nonparametric statistical kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney u-tests were used for multiple and paired comparisons, respectively. post hoc spearman's correlation tests were calculated to check the dependence between bacteria adhesion and surface properties. results: x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of silver on treated samples and showed that treatments with higher silver nitrate concentration and more cycles increased the silver deposition on titanium surface. no negative effects in fibroblast cell viability were detected  and a significant reduction on bacterial adhesion in vitro was achieved in silver-treated samples compared with control titanium. conclusions: silver deposition on titanium with a novel electrochemical anodizing process produced surfaces with significant antibacterial properties in vitro without negative effects on cell viability.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == covalent immobilization of hlf1-11 peptide on a titanium surface reduces bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
AB  == bacterial infection represents a major cause of implant failure in dentistry. a common approach to overcoming this issue and treating peri-implant infection consists in the use of antibiotics. however, the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses serious concerns to this strategy. a promising alternative is the  use of antimicrobial peptides due to their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and reduced bacterial resistance responses. the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the human lactoferrin-derived peptide hlf1-11 anchored to titanium surfaces. to this end, titanium samples were functionalized with the hlf1-11 peptide either by silanization methods or physical adsorption. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful covalent attachment of the hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces. lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that hlf1-11 peptide did not affect fibroblast viability. an outstanding reduction in the adhesion and early stages of biofilm formation of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius was observed on the biofunctionalized surfaces compared to control non-treated samples. furthermore, samples coated with the hlf1-11 peptide inhibited the early stages of bacterial growth. thus, this strategy holds great potential to develop antimicrobial biomaterials for dental applications.

TI  == biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (pds ii(r)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (met) or ciprofloxacin (cip) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. materials and methods: fibrous matrices were processed from pds polymer solution by electrospinning. antibiotic-containing pds solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% met, 25 wt.% met, 5 wt.% cip, and 25 wt.% cip. pure pds was used as a control. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) was done to evaluate met and cip release. dual-species biofilms formed by lactobacillus casei (lc) and streptococcus salivarius (ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. after 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) using agar diffusion assay. results: a three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. pure pds showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% met (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% met (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% cip (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% cip (765 +/- 288 nm). hplc demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. no inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. meanwhile, cip-containing matrices inhibited growth of fn and aa. conclusion: cip-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. clinical relevance: based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  == introduction: the aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. methods: actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. the mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. after incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ch), 2% chlorhexidine solution (chx), and 50 mug/ml hbd3 solution. a commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture  of biofilms. the percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. results: three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (p < .001). the hbd3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (p < .05). the ch and chx groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (p <  .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p > .05). conclusions: hbd3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either ch or chx.

TI  == viability of probiotic lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. to exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) cfu/g or ml throughout its shelf life. one of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. the objective of this study was to  investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. yoghurts with l. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus),  added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. yoghurt without  probiotic added was produced as a control. the products were stored at 4 degrees  c and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. in these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters ph and acidity were analyzed. the results were evaluated using analysis of variance and tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. l. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) cfu / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. when the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of l. casei except for the first day of storage.

TI  == body fluid identification by integrated analysis of dna methylation and body fluid-specific microbial dna.
AB  == identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. previous studies have reported that dna methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tdmrs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial dna can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. in the present study, a method for detecting bacterial dna was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. the developed multiplex pcr was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by  including amplicons for the 16s ribosomal rna gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the usp49, dact1, and pfn3 tdmrs and by hypermethylation at l81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria,  veillonella atypica and/or streptococcus salivarius. additionally, vaginal fluid  and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the pfn3 tdmr and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and/or lactobacillus gasseri. because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of dna for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid  in one pcr reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == influence of the probiotic streptococcus salivarius strain m18 on indices of dental health in children: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == the prevalence of dental caries continues to increase, and novel strategies to reverse this trend appear necessary. the probiotic streptococcus salivarius strain m18 offers the potential to confer oral health benefits as it produces bacteriocins targeting the important cariogenic species streptococcus mutans, as  well as the enzymes dextranase and urease, which could help reduce dental plaque  accumulation and acidification, respectively. in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 100 dental caries-active children, treatment with m18 was administered for 3 months and the participants were assessed for changes to their plaque score and gingival and soft-tissue health and to their salivary levels of s. salivarius, s. mutans, lactobacilli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and candida species. at treatment end, the plaque scores were significantly (p =  0.05) lower for children in the m18-treated group, especially in subjects having  high initial plaque scores. the absence of any significant adverse events supported the safety of the probiotic treatment. cell-culture analyses of sequential saliva samples showed no differences between the probiotic and placebo groups in counts of the specifically enumerated oral micro-organisms, with the exception of the subgroup of the m18-treated children who appeared to have been colonized most effectively with m18. this subgroup exhibited reduced s. mutans counts, indicating that the anti-caries activity of m18 probiotic treatments may  be enhanced if the efficiency of colonization is increased. it was concluded that s. salivarius m18 can provide oral health benefits when taken regularly.

AB  == background: several studies have suggested that probiotics (prob) and/or prebiotics (preb) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. we aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with prob and preb could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (aom). methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from november 2007 to april 2009, 37 pediatricians in france enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of aom who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with prob (streptococcus thermophilus ncc 2496, streptococcus salivarius dsm 13084, lactobacillus rhamnosus lpr cgmcc 1.3724) and preb (raftilose/raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). during 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of aom episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by  the poisson model (incidence rate ratio [irr]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% ci]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. results: we enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). all children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. in total, 486 aom episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. the treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of aom (irr 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (irr 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (irr = 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2). treatment was not associated with recurrent aom (odds ratio 1.0, 95% ci: 0.5-1.7). with regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. conclusion: the prob and preb included in follow-up formula given to children at  7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of aom, recurrent aom, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.

TI  == in-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  == objective: dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. materials and methods: saponins were extracted from bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium and purified. antimicrobial properties of these saponins against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of madhuca longifolia saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, streptococcus mitis and staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and bauhinia purpurea saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. conclusion: the strong antimicrobial activity of madhuca longifolia and bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. hence, these extracted saponins may be used in  food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == reduced salivary flow and colonization by mutans streptococci in children with down syndrome.
AB  == objectives: although individuals with down syndrome have considerable oral disease, the prevalence of dental caries in this group is low. the present study  aimed to compare known risk factors for dental caries development in children with down syndrome and a matched population (siblings). in both populations, the  number of acidogenic microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species, and the paraffin-stimulated ph, flow rate and iga concentration in whole saliva were evaluated and compared. method: saliva was collected, and the caries index was evaluated in 45 sibling pairs aged between 6  and 18 years old. the salivary iga concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species were quantified on mitis salivarius agar containing bacitracin and 20% sucrose, rogosa agar supplemented with glacial acetic acid and sabouraud agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, respectively. results: down syndrome children  had a higher caries-free rate (p<0.05) and lower salivary mutans streptococci counts (p<0.03) compared to their siblings. similar numbers of lactobacilli and candida species were found in both groups. salivary flow rates were 36% lower in  down syndrome children compared to their siblings (p<0.05). the salivary ph did not differ between down syndrome children and controls. the down syndrome children had an iga secretion rate 29% lower than that of their siblings, but this difference was not statistically significant. conclusions: in conclusion, the lower number of mutans streptococci in the saliva may be one of the factors contributing to the lower caries rate observed in down syndrome children, despite evidence of hyposalivation.

TI  == purification and genetic characterisation of the novel bacteriocin ls2 produced by the human oral strain lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral strain with probiotic characteristics and a broad inhibitory spectrum both against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. here we present the bacteriocin ls2, an extremely ph- and heat-stable peptide with antilisterial activity. ls2 is a novel member of the class iid bacteriocins, unique among all currently characterised bacteriocins. it is somewhat similar to putative bacteriocins from several oral streptococci, including the cariogenic streptococcus mutans. ls2 is a 41-amino-acid, highly hydrophobic cationic peptide of 4115.1da that is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. ls2 was purified from cells of strain bgho1 by solvent extraction and reverse-phase chromatography. mass spectrometry was used to determine the molecular mass of the purified peptide. n-terminal amino acid sequencing enabled  identification of the ls2 structural gene bacls2 by a reverse genetics approach.  downstream of the bacls2 gene, two bacteriocin-like genes were found, named blp1a and blp1b, and one putative bacteriocin immunity gene named bimlp. we also present the identification of the 242-kb megaplasmid pmpho1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which harbours the genes bacls2, blp1a, blp1b and bimlp. two peptides with antimicrobial activity, whose approximate sizes corresponded to those of blp1a and blp1b, were identified only after culturing strain bgho1 in a  chemically defined medium. this study demonstrated the capacity of lactobacillus  salivarius bgho1 to produce multiple bacteriocins and further established this strain as a promising probiotic candidate.

TI  == in vitro functional and immunomodulatory properties of the lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5-streptococcus salivarius st3 association that are relevant to the development of a pharyngeal probiotic product.
AB  == the use of proper bacterial strains as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa is a  potential prophylactic strategy for upper respiratory tract infections. in this context, we characterized in vitro the functional and immunomodulatory properties of the strains lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5 and streptococcus salivarius st3 that were selected during previous investigations as promising pharyngeal probiotics. in this study, we demonstrated in vitro that strains mimlh5 and st3,  alone and in combination, can efficiently adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells,  antagonize streptococcus pyogenes, and modulate host innate immunity by inducing  potentially protective effects. in particular, we found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 activate u937 human macrophages by significantly inducing the expression  of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). nonetheless, the induction of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (il-10) by mimlh5 or st3 was never lower than that of tnf-alpha, suggesting that these bacteria can potentially exert a regulatory rather than a proinflammatory effect. we also found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 induce cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2) expression and demonstrated that toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2) participates in the recognition of the strains mimlh5 and st3 by u937 cells. finally, we observed that these microorganisms grow efficiently when cocultured in milk, suggesting that the preparation of a milk-based fermented product containing both mimlh5 and st3 can be a practical solution for the administration of these bacteria. in conclusion, we propose the combined use of l. helveticus mimlh5 and s. salivarius st3 for the preparation of novel products that display probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == the influence of probiotic treatment on sulfasalazine metabolism in rat.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms claimed to exert beneficial effects on the host. this study investigated their effect on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of sulfasalazine (ssz), a drug whose efficacy depends on metabolism by azoreductase (ar) in the gut microbiota to sulfapyridine (sp) and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-asa). the probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus l10, bifidobacterium lactis b94 and streptococcus salivarius k12 possessed ar activity and a corresponding ability to metabolize ssz. treatment of male wistar  rats (n = 5) with oral 2 g doses of a mixture of the three probiotics (total dose 1.8 x 10(9) cfu) every 12 h for 3 days resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in ar activity in ex vivo colon contents with a corresponding increase in ssz metabolism. similar probiotic treatment of male wistar rats (n = 8) followed  by an oral 100 mg/kg dose of ssz produced high plasma levels of sp, but pharmacokinetic parameters of ssz and sp were not significantly different from control rats given ssz. these results indicate that probiotic strains possess ar  activity and can metabolize ssz. treatment with probiotics increases ar activity  in the gut microbiota but has no effect on plasma levels of ssz and sp following  a subsequent oral dose of ssz.

TI  == development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  == introduction: the development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize  the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. methods: four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ  hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. the live/dead baclight technique (molecular probes, carlsbad, ca) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. results: the 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. the biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. a high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. the community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did  not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which e. faecalis, l. salivarius, and s. gordonii were most abundant. conclusions: the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study  give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. this multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on the mechanical behavior of titanium dental implants.
AB  == purpose: this study sought to determine whether the mechanical properties of titanium dental implants changed after exposure to bacteria. materials and methods: two strains of bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) were used in the study. the adhesive properties of the two strains were investigated as follows. titanium implants were placed in bacteria broth, seeded with the two bacteria strains, and left in the broth for 1 or 3 months. another group of titanium implants was immersed in artificial saliva at 37 degrees c for 3 months. ten implants in each group were tested in 37 degrees c artificial saliva to evaluate their mechanical flexural strength and fatigue life. results: the bacterial cultures grew quickly on titanium surfaces. after 1  month of bacteria culture in vitro, the bacteria had produced corrosion pits on the titanium surfaces. after 3 months of bacterial culture, a 7% decrease in the  flexural strength of the implant samples and a decrease of 15% in the number of cycles to failure by fatigue were seen versus implants not exposed to bacteria. conclusions: these results demonstrate that, in physiologic conditions in vitro,  bacteria have the capacity to produce a pitting corrosion phenomenon on exposed titanium surfaces, leading to a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties of the implant. it is therefore logical to conclude that bacteria may  produce corrosion that reduces the useful life of dental implants.

TI  == streptococci-human papilloma virus interaction with ethanol exposure leads to keratinocyte damage.
AB  == purpose: ethanol, human papilloma virus (hpv), and poor oral hygiene are risk factors that have been attributed to oral carcinogenesis. streptococci sp and hpv infections are common in the head and neck, often associated with sexual activity. although hpv is linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is  unclear whether there is a similar role for streptococci sp. this cell study examines whether streptococci sp and hpv-16 with exposure to ethyl alcohol (etoh) can act as cofactors in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. materials and methods: etoh (0.1%-20% vol/vol) was used to investigate streptococci sp attachment with immortalized e6-expressing hpv/hok-16b cells, human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes. streptococci sp (streptococci mutans [lt11]) and various strains of acetaldehyde (aa) producer and nonproducer streptococcus salivarius (110-1, 109-2, 101-7, and 107-1) and a lactic acid producer bacterium, lactobacillus rhamnosus (24-1 and 25-2), were examined for interactions with keratinocytes by use of a green dye (percent of cells with colonies after 24 hours). carcinogens, aa, malondialdehyde, dna damage, and proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) among keratinocytes were also quantified. results: aa and malondialdehyde production from permissible streptococci sp significantly increased with attachment to keratinocytes, whereas l rhamnosus did not significantly attach to keratinocytes. this attachment was associated with enhanced levels of aa adduct formation, proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation), and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by hpv oral keratinocytes, which are characteristics of a malignant phenotype. conclusions: these cell studies suggest that oral streptococci sp and hpv (hpv-16) cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after low-level etoh (1%) exposure. these results appear to suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against listeria monocytogenes infection. in this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven  l. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain l. salivarius ucc118. this revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these  strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class iib bacteriocins. however, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. they ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin p, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin t, which is characterized in this study. salivaricin t inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little  homology to previously characterized salivaricins. interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin t activity, saltalpha and saltbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus. furthermore, the salivaricin  locus of strain dpc6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class iid  anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin l. these findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal l. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus la-k.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 mpa or less. it is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0,  3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 mpa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12, s. salivarius ssp.  thermophilus st-m5, and l. acidophilus la-k. the cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees c) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of  incubation. protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. all homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. a pressure of 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus st-m5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of l. acidophilus la-k but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. some low homogenization pressures  positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and l. acidophilus la-k. culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.

TI  == in situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  == many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. however, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. as a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16s ribosomal rna fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation  by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: streptococcus sanguinis,  actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus salivarius. surfaces blasted with al(2)  o(3) (s(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (s(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (s(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned  surfaces. hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. after 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii only). the biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.

TI  == oral microflora in infants delivered vaginally and by caesarean section.
AB  == background. early in life, vaginally delivered infants exhibit a different composition of the gut flora compared with infants delivered by caesarean section (c-section); however, it is unclear whether this also applies to the oral cavity. aim. to investigate and compare the oral microbial profile between infants delivered vaginally and by c-section. design. this is a cross-sectional case-control study. eighty-four infants delivered either vaginally (n = 42) or by c-section (n = 42) were randomly selected from the 2009 birth cohort at the county hospital in halmstad, sweden. medically compromised and premature children (<32 weeks) were excluded. the mean age was 8.25 months (range 6-10 months), and  parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, and hygiene habits. saliva was collected and analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results. a higher prevalence of salivary streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus curvata, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacuillus casei was detected in infants delivered vaginally (p < 0.05). the  caries-associated bacteria streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were detected in 63% and 59% of all children, respectively. conclusion. a significantly higher prevalence of certain strains of health-related streptococci and lactobacilli was found in vaginally delivered infants compared with infants delivered by c-section. the possible long-term effects on oral health need to be  further investigated.

TI  == metabolism of l-selenomethionine and selenite by probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == since selenium supplements have been shown to undergo biotransformation in the gut, probiotic treatment in combination with selenium supplements may change selenium disposition. we investigated the metabolism of l-selenomethionine (semet) and selenite by probiotic bacteria in vitro and the disposition of selenium after probiotic treatment followed by oral dosing with semet and selenite in rats. when semet was incubated anaerobically with individual antibiotic-resistant probiotic strains (streptococcus salivarius k12, lactobacillus rhamnosus 67b, lactobacillus acidophilus l10, and bifidobacterium lactis lafti(r) b94) at 37 degrees c for 24 h, 11-18% was metabolized with 44-80% of semet lost being converted to dimethyldiselenide (dmdse) and dimethylselenide  (dmse). in similar incubations with selenite, metabolism was more extensive (26-100%) particularly by the lactobacilli with 0-4.8% of selenite lost being converted to dmse and dmdse accompanied by the formation of elemental selenium. four groups of rats (n = 5/group) received a single oral dose of either semet or  selenite (2 mg selenium/kg) at the time of the last dose of a probiotic mixture or its vehicle (lyoprotectant mixture used to maintain cell viability) administered every 12 h for 3 days. another three groups of rats (n = 3/group) received a single oral dose of saline or semet or selenite at the same dose (untreated rats). serum selenium concentrations over the subsequent 24 h were not significantly different between probiotic and vehicle treated rats but appeared to be more sustained (semet) or higher (selenite) than in the corresponding groups of untreated rats. probiotic treated rats given semet also had selenium concentrations at 24 h that were significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney than untreated rats given semet. thus, treatment with probiotics followed  by semet significantly affects tissue levels of selenium.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == identification of the bacterial community responsible for traditional fermentation during sour cassava starch, cachaca and minas cheese production using culture-independent 16s rrna gene sequence analysis.
AB  == we used a cultivation-independent, clone library-based 16s rrna gene sequence analysis to identify bacterial communities present during traditional fermentation in sour cassava starch, cachaca and cheese production in brazil. partial 16s rrna gene clone sequences from sour cassava starch samples collected  on day five of the fermentation process indicated that leuconostoc citreum was the most prevalent species, representing 47.6% of the clones. after 27 days of fermentation, clones (genbank accession numbers gq999786 and gq999788) related to unculturable bacteria were the most prevalent, representing 43.8% of the clones from the bacterial community analyzed. the clone represented by the sequence gq999786 was the most prevalent at the end of the fermentation period. the majority of clones obtained from cachaca samples during the fermentation of sugar cane juice were from the genus lactobacillus. lactobacillus nagelli was the most  prevalent at the beginning of the fermentation process, representing 76.9% of the clones analyzed. after 21 days, lactobacillus harbinensis was the most prevalent  species, representing 75% of the total clones. at the end of the fermentation period, lactobacillus buchneri was the most prevalent species, representing 57.9% of the total clones. in the minas cheese samples, lactococcus lactis was the most prevalent species after seven days of ripening. after 60 days of ripening, streptococcus salivarius was the most prevalent species. our data show that these three fermentation processes are conducted by a succession of bacterial species,  of which lactic acid bacteria are the most prevalent.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == oral bacteria in biofilms exhibit slow reactivation from nutrient deprivation.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to enter a non-growing state is believed to be an important mechanism for survival in the starved micro-environments of the oral cavity. in this study, we examined the reactivation of nutrient-deprived cells of two oral bacteria in biofilms, streptococcus anginosus and lactobacillus salivarius. non-growing cells were generated by incubation in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer for 24 h and the results were compared to those of planktonic cultures. when both types of cells were shifted from a rich, peptone-yeast extract-glucose (pyg) medium to buffer for 24 h, dehydrogenase and esterase activity measured by the fluorescent dyes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl-tetrazolium chloride (ctc) and fluorescein diacetate (fda), respectively, was absent in both  species. however, the membranes of the vast majority of nutrient-deprived cells remained intact as assessed by live/dead staining. metabolic reactivation of the  nutrient-deprived biofilm cells was not observed for at least 48 h following addition of fresh pyg medium, whereas the non-growing planktonic cultures of the  same two strains were in rapid growth in less than 2 h. at 72 h, the s. anginosus biofilm cells had recovered 78 % of the dehydrogenase activity and 61 % of the esterase activity and the biomass mm(-2) had increased by 30-35 %. with l. salivarius at 72 h, the biofilms had recovered 56 % and 75 % of dehydrogenase and esterase activity, respectively. reactivation of both species in biofilms was enhanced by removal of glucose from pyg, and s. anginosus cells were particularly responsive to yeast extract (ye) medium. the data suggest that the low reactivity of non-growing biofilm cells to the introduction of fresh nutrients may be a survival strategy employed by micro-organisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == short-term relative antibacterial effect of octenidine dihydrochloride on the oral microflora in orthodontically treated patients.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (oct). methods: the antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. after unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. results: oct had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (pvp-i) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). the antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% chx on total  bacteria and lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% pvp-i mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i, 0.5mg/ml chx, and 0.1mg/ml oct concentrations, while streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i,  2mg/ml chx, and 0.8mg/ml oct concentrations. lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml oct, 30mg/ml pvp-i, and 0.0063mg/ml chx concentrations. conclusions: oct compared favorably with chx and pvp-i in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == new culture media for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  == the reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. the frequent presence of fungi, particularly candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial crt bacteria (ivoclar vivadent) culture media. such identification is important for the application of chemical measures  to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. objective: the aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial crt bacteria culture medium  and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (msbtpf) for the isolation of streptococcus; and man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 u/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (mrsbf) for the isolation of lactobacillus spp. results: candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. in all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in  mrsbf was identified as lactobacillus, while in crt bacteria for lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. s. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in msbtpf medium, while in crt bacteria for s. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. conclusion: the culture medium developed in the present study was able  to inhibit the 100% of candida spp. growth. these new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.

AB  == four lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus paraplantarum km, enterococcus durans kh, streptococcus salivarius hm and weissella confusa jy, were isolated from humans and tested for their capabilities of converting isoflavone glucosides to aglycones in soymilk. changes in growth, ph, and titratable acidity (ta) were  investigated during fermentation at 37 degrees c for 12 h. after 6 to 9 h of fermentation, each population of 4 lab reached 10(8) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the initial ph of 6.3 +/- 0.1 decreased while the ta of 0.13%+/- 0.01% increased as fermentation proceeded, resulting in the final range between 4.1 +/- 0.2 and 4.6  +/- 0.1 for ph and between 0.51%+/- 0.02% and 0.67%+/- 0.06% for ta after the 12  h of fermentation. the glucoside concentrations were significantly decreased in soymilks fermented with either l. paraplantarum km, s. salivarius hm, or w. confusa jy with fermentation time (p < 0.05). l. paraplantarum km was the best in percent conversion of glucosides to corresponding aglycones, resulting in 100%, 90%, and 61% hydrolysis of genistin, daidzin, and glycitin, respectively, in 6 h. consequently, the aglycone concentrations in soymilk fermented with l. paraplantarum km were 6 and 7-fold higher than the initial levels of daidzein and genistein, respectively, after 6 h of fermentation. changes in the daidzin and genistin levels were not significant in soymilk fermented with e. durans kh. the  rates of hydrolysis of glucosides varied depending on the species of lab. especially, l. paraplantarum km seems to be a promising starter for bioactive-fermented soymilk based on its growth, acid production, and isoflavone  conversion within a short time.

AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria and other gut bacteria in pigs by a macroarraying method.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) consist of many genera, gram-positive, and nonspore-forming micro-organisms; some members being used as probiotics while some others have negative effects on pig health. bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract can produce antibacterial substances, reduce serum cholesterol in their host, or can be responsible for growth reduction, diarrhea,  and intestinal epithelial damage. it is therefore important for the pig industry  to evaluate the impact of food and farm management on the presence of "good" or "bad" bacteria and the risk for consumers. this articles focuses on the molecular identification of gut microflora species following different diets given to pigs  in uk and correlating the data on growth, health, and welfare. first of all, pig  feces were individually collected from sows before and after farrowing and also from piglets before and after weaning over several months. bacteria colonies were grown on mrs agar plates from feces and dna was extracted (qiaamp dna stool kit)  and amplified using 16s rdna (27f and 519r) primers. dna sequencing and sequence  alignment allowed us to identify species-specific zones, which were used as probes in a macroarray system also known as reverse line blot hybridization. some probes were found to be species specific for the following species: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. animalis, l. gallinarum, l. kitasanotis, l salivarius, streptococcus alactolyticus, s. hyointestinalis, and sarcina ventriculi. actual studies are now focusing on the impact of diets of the microflora in different gut parts and at different stages of the animal's life.

TI  == a modified dip-slide test for microbiological risk in caries assessment.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in thailand. saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar, rogosa agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. a slide was incubated in a 5% co2  incubator for 48 hours. the results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. the salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (kendall tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). the correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels in patients. the test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. in addition, it would be a valuable educational  aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.

TI  == antibiotic resistances of starter and probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the antibiotic resistances of 45 lactic acid bacteria strains belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus, pediococcus, and leuconostoc were investigated. the objective was to determine antibiotic resistances and to verify these at the genetic level, as is currently suggested by the european "qualified presumption of safety" safety evaluation system for industrial starter strains. in addition, we sought to pinpoint possible problems in resistance determinations. primers were used to pcr amplify genes involved in beta-lactam antibiotic, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin resistance. the presence of ribosomal protection protein genes and the ermb gene was also determined by using a gene probe. generally, the incidences of erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, or beta-lactam resistances in this study were low  (<7%). in contrast, aminoglycoside (gentamicin and streptomycin) and ciprofloxacin resistances were higher than 70%, indicating that these may constitute intrinsic resistances. the genetic basis for ciprofloxacin resistance  could not be verified, since no mutations typical of quinolone resistances were detected in the quinolone determining regions of the parc and gyra genes. some starter strains showed low-level ampicillin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline resistances, but no known resistance genes could be detected. although some strains possessed the cat gene, none of these were phenotypically resistant to chloramphenicol. using reverse transcription-pcr, these cat genes were shown to be silent under both inducing and noninducing conditions. only lactobacillus salivarius bfe 7441 possessed an ermb gene, which was encoded on the chromosome and which could not be transferred in filter-mating experiments. this study clearly demonstrates problems encountered with resistance testing, in  that the breakpoint values are often inadequately identified, resistance genes may be present but silent, and the genetic basis and associated resistance mechanisms toward some antibiotics are still unknown.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == effects of extracts of miswak and derum on proliferation of balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: this study examined the effects of extracts of two chewing sticks on  proliferation of fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria. methods: aqueous extracts of miswak (salvadora persica; arak tree) and derum (juglans regia; walnut tree) were prepared and their effects investigated on growth of balb/c 3t3 mouse fibroblasts by measuring the mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity. furthermore, the effects on the viability of various cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus) was also determined. results: the data revealed that balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts exposed to aqueous extracts of miswak or derum showed an increase in cell proliferation by 156% and 255%, respectively, in comparison with controls (p < 0.0001). furthermore, extracts from both miswak  and derum had adverse effects on the growth of the cariogenic microorganisms, with derum having significantly greater antimicrobial effects than miswak and at  much lower concentrations against all the bacteria tested. the most sensitive organisms were a. viscosus, followed by s. mutans, s. salivarius, with l. casei being the most resistant. conclusion: the results show that aqueous extracts of miswak and derum enhance the growth of fibroblasts and inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, with the derum extract showing greater activity than miswak.

TI  == effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by sonicare advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. methods: a wild strain of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius and veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. for each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. biofilms were divided into four groups and  were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. the distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. a colorimetric technique (mtt assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the  adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. results: anova results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of s. mutans  and s. salivarius adherent to the disks, while l. acidophilus and v. alcalescens  seemed to remain basically unaffected. in the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while s. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, s. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to sonicare.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

AB  == probiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered to be non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic on the basis of long years of safe usage. however, some species of lactobacilli are thought to be associated with the development of dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to examine the cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius in rats. rats were divided into six groups, and infected with l. salivarius ls1952r and/or streptococcus mutans mt8148r. l. salivarius ls1952r became established in the oral cavity of rats and induced significant level of dental caries even when infected for only 5 days from 18 to 22 days of age. in addition, the caries scores of rats superinfected with both streptococcus mutans mt8148r and l. salivarius ls1952r from 18 days of age were significantly higher than those infected with either l. salivarius ls1952r or s. mutans mt8148r alone. since strain ls1952r can adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatites, it is concluded that  l. salivarius strain ls1952r possesses an inherent cariogenic activity following  adherence to the tooth surface.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == low ph-induced membrane fatty acid alterations in oral bacteria.
AB  == four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. streptococcus gordonii dl1, as well as the aciduric strains s. salivarius 57.i, and lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. the non-aciduric strain s. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to ph  values examined here. thus, in response to low ph, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. this suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == [oral cavity microbial coenobia in healthy children and children with chronic recurrent aphthous stomatitis].
AB  == peculiarities of quantitative and qualitative composition of microbiocenosis of the oral cavity in healthy children and children with chronic aphthous recurrent  stomatitis have been studied. strains of microorganisms (n = 259) have been isolated and identified. the results obtained showed that the studied biotope is  characterised by a wide spectrum of isolated microflora. the growth of microorganism association is observed in all the studied samples. the analysis of genus and species composition of microbiocenosis of the mucous membrane indicated that streptococci, neiserii, corynebacteria, enterococci, lactobacilli, epidermal staphylococci and candidas were distinguished as to isolation frequency among the isolated strains. these bacteria were isolated from oral cavity of healthy and sick children, but their quantity in 1 mm2 of sick children mucosa prevailed, except for streptococcus salivarius, s. mitis and lactobacillus sp.: their quantity was far less. golden staphylococci, escherichia, klebsiella, clostridia, hemophilic rods and campylobacteria were isolated from sick children only.

TI  == biochemical and molecular characterization of a levansucrase from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (ftf) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. purification of this ftf (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (lev) consisting  of 804 amino acids. lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of l. reuteri 121 [inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with ftfs from streptococci. expression of lev in escherichia coli resulted in an active ftf (lev delta 773his) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as l. reuteri 121 cells grown  on raffinose. the low degree of branching of the l. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. although lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. lev is strongly dependent on ca(2+) ions  for activity. unique properties of l. reuteri lev together with inu are: (i) the  presence of a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for ftf enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees c, kinetics that are best described by the hill equation.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == characterization of urease genes cluster of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: the milk acidification rate of streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. to evaluate the technological suitability of s. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to  urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain dsm 20167t. methods and results: amplification of the urease genes of s. thermophilus dsm 20167t was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related s. salivarius. nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureabc (structural genes) and urei, ureefgd (accessory genes) of s. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. reverse transcriptase pcr experiments were in agreement with  an operon organization for the eight genes (ureiabcefgd). a food grade mutant a16 (deltaurec3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in urec gene exhibited a urease negative (ure-) phenotype. unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. a small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using  the wild-type or the ure- mutant a16 (deltaurec3) in co-culture with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 in presence of urea. the result obtained underlines that when the ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. conclusions: the study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of s. thermophilus dsm 20617t urease activity. significance and impact of the study: the detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade ure- recombinant strain. small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a ure-s. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in  milk fermentations. moreover, the vector pmi108 developed for the construction of the ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of ure- dairy s. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.

TI  == multiple competitive pcr-dgge as a tool for quantifying and profiling defined mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria during production of probiotics from complex polysaccharides.
AB  == aims: to apply a denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (dgge) method to quantify and profile individual strains during a mixed culture fermentation. methods and results: dna was extracted during the culture of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and amplified in a multiple competitive pcr (cpcr) using general primers targeting 16s rdna and dna from streptococcus salivarius as competitive dna. subsequently the 200-kb amplified fragments were separated by dgge. the method was validated in pure cultures and used to profile a mixture of three lab grown on glucose, soluble starch and glycogen from mussel processing waste. the inclusion of a starch- and glycogen-degrading strain (lactobacillus plantarum) and a weakly amylotic nisin-resistant strain (lact. paracasei) allowed proliferation of the nisin producing lactococcus lactis which in itself is unable to grow on complex carbohydrates. cpcr-dgge permitted the monitoring of a different strain succession on the different carbohydrates, related to amylolytic activity and substrate consumption, acid production and nisin production. conclusions: cpcr-dgge is a useful tool for profiling defined mixed cultures of bacteria and hence allows their interaction to be studied. significance and impact of the study: provided validation of the method for each specific case, it may be appropriate to monitor and control the reproducibility of any defined mixed culture of bacteria, with the advantage that an increase in the strain numbers to be monitored does not yield an increase in the labour of the procedure.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  == naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. in general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for  prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. as an  alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. a novel decapeptide, kkvvfkvkfk (ksl), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. cytotoxic activity of ksl against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional nmr in aqueous and dmso solutions. mics of ksl for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). minimal bactericidal concentrations of ksl were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the mics. ksl exhibited an ed(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees c) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in addition, ksl damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. in vitro toxicity studies showed that ksl, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. nmr studies suggest that ksl adopts an alpha-helical structure in dmso solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment,  whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. this study shows that ksl may  be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in traditional african yoghurt fermentation.
AB  == growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/-  0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c  for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but  not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == expression of a streptococcal glucosyltransferase as a fusion to a solute-binding protein in lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == bspa is a non-covalently anchored cystine-binding protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11. it has previously been used to present antigens derived from infectious organisms on the l. fermentum br11 cell surface. in this study, the capacity of bspa to present a very large polypeptide was tested. a temperature sensitive plasmid was constructed that encodes a 175-kda chimeric protein consisting of a fusion between bspa and an n-terminally truncated derivative of the streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 glucosyltransferase gtfj. this plasmid was introduced into the l. fermentum genome. integrants were able to incorporate  20-40 nmol sucrose derived glucose into glucan per ml culture per optical density unit. the glucosyltransferase activity was external to the cytoplasmic membrane and bound to the cell. unlike native bspa, the bspa-gtfj fusion could not be removed from the cell by 5 m licl wash.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that  of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the  spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca.  22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.

TI  == simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  == indisim, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. to this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. in the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. it was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of l.  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. an important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. in the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. the results of these  simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of  [lait 69 (1989) 519]. finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.

TI  == a clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic study of deep caries lesions after incomplete caries removal.
AB  == objective: clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing.  method and materials: thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. the color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing  and after the experimental period. the samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar, and rogosa selective lactobacillus agar. results: two cases were lost during the study; one  presented pulpal necrosis. in the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. the dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. there was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. the counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. conclusion: incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

AB  == national and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. in venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some  commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. this research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. for this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. the  different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. these samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of ph and acidity. the absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. the succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. the data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

AB  == background & aims: pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. most patients have relapsing disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. we evaluated the  efficacy of a probiotic preparation (vsl#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. methods:  forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive either vsl#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. patients were assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2 months or in the case of a relapse. fecal samples were collected for stool culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance treatment. results: three patients (15%) in the vsl#3 group had relapses within the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and s. thermophilus  increased significantly from baseline levels only in the vsl#3-treated group (p < 0.01). conclusions: these results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.

TI  == probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  == low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the ph reached 5.6 (end point 2). mix was frozen and stored for  11 wk at -20 degrees c. the traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus. the probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus. we compared recovery of bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system  with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. the roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of b. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. no change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to ph 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. the presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.

TI  == quantification of micro-organisms in binary mixed populations by fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy.
AB  == fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy was used for the first time to determine the ratios of different microorganisms in mixtures. exemplarily, systems composed of two food-associated yeast species (saccharomyces cerevisiae/hanseniaspora uvarum) and two yoghurt lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus/streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) were investigated. determination of the cell number ratio in the lactic acid bacteria  system was possible with a minimal prediction accuracy of +/- 16 ratio percentage points while the minimum accuracy of prediction in the yeast two-component system was +/- 4% (both at a 95% confidence level). these results show that ft-ir spectroscopy is potentially a rapid method for the quantification of cell ratios  in mixtures of two different microorganisms, provided that the cell ratio does not drop below a certain, system-specific threshold.

TI  == impact on the composition of the faecal flora by a new probiotic preparation: preliminary data on maintenance treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == background: although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. aim: to evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. patients and methods: twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-asa, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (vsl#3, csl, milan, italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. the following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. results: faecal concentrations of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (p<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. concentrations of bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (p = n.s.). fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. no significant side-effects have been reported. conclusions: these results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may  be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant  or allergic to 5-asa. controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.

TI  == starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  == the refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of lactobacillus fermentum, l. casei, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus,  and bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. during storage at 4 degrees c for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. after 28 days, the average numbers of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml, whereas those of l. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) cfu/ml. numbers of b. longum and l. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and l. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. the other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (p > 0.05) on the residual sugars. in most cases, l(+)-lactate predominated.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent dna damage in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. because the mechanisms responsible for these protective  effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. using the "comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that l. bulgaricus 191r applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced dna breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas st. thermophilus ch3 were not effective. however, in vitro, both strains  prevented dna damage induced by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in isolated primary rat colon cells. extracts prepared from milk fermented with st.  thermophilus ch3 were as efficient in deactivating mnng as was l-cysteine. isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [l(+) lactate, d(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. we postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which mnng or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final ph recorded. most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum. streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. plaque ph was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or lactulose bp. these studies in vivo showed both lactulose and lactulose bp to exhibit low acidogenic potential. thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.

TI  == rapid procedure for acid adaptation of oral lactic-acid bacteria and further characterization of the response.
AB  == acid-adaptive responses could be induced readily in oral lactic-acid bacteria by  growing them in batch cultures with excess sugar or more conveniently and rapidly by transferring cells to acidified growth media for the time required for biomass doubling. the response of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was induced in a progressive  rather than all-or-nothing way, and the extent of acid tolerance was inversely related to the ph of the inducing medium over a range from 8.5 to 5. the weak acids fluoride, acetate, or lactate did not measurably enhance acid adaptation, and so the response did not appear to depend primarily on changes in delta ph or  the proton motive force across the cell membrane. transcription and translation to form new proteins did appear to be necessary, as indicated by inhibition of adaptation by rifampin or chloramphenicol and by lack of adaptation by cells suspended in phosphate buffer at ph 5. streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei were acid adapted by the rapid method, and the method appeared to be generally useful for oral lactic-acid bacteria. the rapid induction of the response in multiple oral lactic-acid bacteria suggests that it is of general importance for maintaining a diversity of organisms in the oral microbiota, which is regularly subjected to acid stresses.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == microbial induction of dentinal caries in human teeth in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. a class i cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. the blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. in addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of l. casei with  s. sobrinus or a. viscosus were also prepared. half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the ph of the medium was measured. after 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by brown-brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. the final ph of the s. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the s.  salivarius group. among the monoinfection groups, the s. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the a. viscosus group and the l. casei group. the invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by l. casei, and not by s. sobrinus and a. viscosus. the invasion rate by l. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either s. sobrinus or a. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. these findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.

AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

TI  == influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity of component species of yogurt starter cultures.
AB  == the influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity and the cellular integrity of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus were tested. two strains (os 1 and os 2) of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and three strains (hc 15, 17, and 18) of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus were studied. in the presence of .15% oxgall, beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells of both species was significantly increased. however, at  a higher concentration (.3% oxgall), the beta-galactosidase activity was significantly less than in the presence of .15% oxgall. the presence of oxgall did not promote the cell lysis of any of the strains of either species. additionally, the presence of oxgall did not cause the leakage of the enzyme from the cells. thus, the presence of oxgall increased the cellular permeability to allow more substrate to enter the cells, thereby increasing beta-galactosidase activity, and, at higher concentrations, was inhibitory to beta-galactosidase activity of both species.

TI  == on-line estimation of biological variables during ph controlled lactic acid fermentations.
AB  == indirect measurement of lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and biomass concentration from on-line sodium hydroxide weight measurements have been obtained for pure and mixed batch cultures of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus 404 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 398 conducted at controlled ph and temperature. linear correlations were established between the equivalent sodium hydroxide concentration and the lactose (substrate), galactose  and lactic acid (products) concentrations while nonlinear relationships were developed between biomass and lactic acid concentrations. these nonlinear relationships took into account the inhibitory effect of lactic acid on growth and acidification. the indirect measurements of biomass concentration were introduced into a nonlinear estimator of the state variables and of the specific  growth and lactic acid production rates. good agreement was found between estimated and measured biomass concentrations (error index ranging from 10.8% to  12.6%). the results showed the feasibility of on-line estimation of biomass concentration and of the specific kinetics from naoh addition weight measurements and its applicability for monitoring lactic acid fermentations. using off-line measurements of l(+) and d(-) lactic acid concentrations, the evolution of the concentration of each strain in mixed cultures was obtained from the relationships proposed for the mixed cultures.

TI  == antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  == reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by lactobacillus helveticus ch65, lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. the fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone,  dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the ames test (salmonella typhimurium ta 100) against n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine,  and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitroso-guanidine was 2-  and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. extracts of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r were examined further. compounds that were responsible for activity against  both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. adjustment of milk fermented by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r to ph 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. in contrast, compounds with activity specific for n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at ph 7.6. the weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% l-lactic acid.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

AB  == both intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect,  and the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were analyzed in  128 11-year-old children. the follow-up period was 9 months, with six saliva samplings done at regular intervals. inter-individual variation was relatively large in paraffin-stimulated salivary flow rate: low (< 1.0 ml/min) and high (> or = 2.0 ml/min) flow rates were measured in 18% and 13% of the children, respectively. intraindividual variation during the follow-up period was found in  63% of the boys and in 73% of the girls. the buffer effect stayed stable in all samplings in 59% of the boys and in 42% of the girls. buffer effect was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in girls than in boys. mutans streptococci were analyzed by a chair-side method (strip mutans test) and by cultivation on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the results of the two methods correlated highly significantly (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). with the strip mutans test no variation in test scores occurred in 49% of all subjects in all six samplings, whereas the respective percentage for msb scores was only 19%. no variation in salivary lactobacilli occurred in only 18% of the subjects, and in 13% the intraindividual variation was as high as > or = 3 logs. these results show that in young teenagers with a developing dentition, simultaneous changes in behavioral, hormonal, and dietary factors make single-point measurements of salivary factors too unreliable for caries-diagnostic or predictive purposes.

TI  == prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == the correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. the aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. in some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old south african children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of world health organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the dentocult kit. oral  hygiene was scored on the basis of the greene and vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. the distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (p < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. the r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. the corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs  interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. the data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for  the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. the unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. it is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.

TI  == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.

AB  == sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. when sucrolose  was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar ph falls, compared with controls. the incorporation of 126 mmol/l sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, streptococcus sanguis 10904, streptococcus sanguis challis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus wvu627. sucralose had no effect on ips production. sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent  of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. no radioactive polymer was formed from 14c-u-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (gtf) or fructosyl-transferase (ftf). inhibition of gtf and ftf by sucralose was  removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. these results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on gtf and ftf was non-competitive and reversible. the results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel applied by tray or by toothbrush on salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == a chlorhexidine (1%)-sodium fluoride (0.2%) gel applied using a dental tray six times during two consecutive days significantly decreased salivary levels of mutans streptococci but had only a slight effect on salivary levels of lactobacilli. the same gel used as a dentifrice for one week (twice a day) also significantly reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci. however, this treatment was somewhat less effective than that using trays, on the basis of the  ratio of mutans streptococci to total aerobes. with both treatments baseline salivary levels of mutans streptococci were re-attained after 70 days. one day after the gel treatment, mutans streptococci were unable to adhere to plastic strips (dentocult sm strip mutans) but detectable growth was found on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. this suggests that not only are numbers of mutans streptococci reduced after chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel treatment but also mutans streptococci adherence.

AB  == the two restriction enzymes smai and apai were found to produce distributions of  dna fragments useful for genome analysis of some lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the genome size was estimated to be 1750 to 2500 kb depending on the species. each strain displayed unique restriction patterns; nevertheless, the percentage of the comigrating fragments of two isogenic or closely related strains was about 80% and fell to 20-40% when the patterns of two non-related strains of the same species or two strains belonging  to different species were compared.

AB  == cells of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly  to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. entrapped cells of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. the kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by l. lactis subsp. lactis and s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

TI  == degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane atpases of oral streptococci.
AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

AB  == feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. streptococcus thermophilus also survived  in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be  examined. both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. streptococcus thermophilus but not lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and lactose as the test substrates. enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with onpg in the intestinal mucosa fraction. the bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. the other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (lact. salivarius).

AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.

TI  == common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: isolation and biochemical characterization of the extracellular protein antigen.
AB  == an extracellular soluble common protein (ecp) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of streptococcus sanguis omz9, of a representative strain of each of bratthall's seven serological groups of streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of lactobacillus salivarius and actinomyces viscosus. the ecp antigens from the different strains  were prepared from sds-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography  on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. the identity of such purified ecp antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in sds-page, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. this common antigen (ecp) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.

TI  == influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
AB  == 1. the gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. in 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli  exceeded those of control chicks. 3. high counts of proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. in vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. 4. the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. the protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to l. salivarius. 5. the ph was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. of the strains  used in gnotobiotic experiments e. coli, s. faecalis and l. salivarius produced the lowest ph values in the caeca.

TI  == production of lipoteichoic acid by lactobacilli and streptococci grown in different environments.
AB  == representative strains of streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 and of four lactobacillus species were examined for the production of cellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acid (lta) when grown at ph 6.0 in batch culture to the stationary phase with either glucose or fructose. extracellular lta was a minor component in all cases except for l. fermentum and l. casei nird r094 grown in fructose. the total amount of lta (cellular and extracellular) produced by fructose-grown cultures was also considerably greater for these two strains, for  l. salivarius, and also two of the s. sanguis strains. growth of l. fermentum and l. casei in continuous culture in a chemostat showed that generation time and ph  of growth can influence the total amount of lta and the proportion of extracellular material. the results for glucose-limited cultures were quite disparate, with l. fermentum forming considerably more extracellular lta than l.  casei. however, in fructose-limited cultures l. fermentum formed less total lta and l. casei more so that the differences were only minor. a difference in the utilization of glucose and fructose by the heterofermentative l. fermentum and the homofermentative l. casei strains is also indicated by differences in the yield of organisms at different dilution rates in continuous culture.

AB  == the incidence of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, total streptococci and lactobacilli was examined in highly caries active 13-14-year-old schoolchildren participating in a prophylactic program. after 1 year of trial, professional toothcleaning once every second week markedly reduced the frequency of gingivitis and the caries increment. bimonthly topical applications of a 0.5% chlorhexidine  gel with or without subsequent rinsing with 2% nfp had no effect on plaque score  and gingivitis but tended to reduce the caries activity. no significant changes were found in the groups with regard to the salivary number of total streptococci and s. sanguis. a reduction of the population of s. salivarius, s. mutans and lactobacilli was observed in the chlorhexidine group. in the group where chlorhexidine was combined with mfp, only s. mutans was reduced.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  == s. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque  from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. nearly all of 107 isolated s. mutans strains belonged to  the serotype group c/e/f. the proportion of s. sanguis, in contrast to those of s. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. the proportions of s. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or  clinically-sound tooth surfaces. the findings provide further support for the role of s. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. in the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. in addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.

TI  == sucrose-induced ecological response of experimental dental plaques from caries-free and caries-susceptible human volunteers.
AB  == microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. the appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. the responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. in all plaques, exposure to 10%  sucrose stimulated the succession of veillonella spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of streptococcus sanguis, neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and neisseria spp. and lower levels of lactobacillus spp. sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14c]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees c than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. the experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.

AB  == the intra- and intergeneric relationships of the genus staphylococcus, and the phylogenetic position of peptococcus saccharolyticus and micrococcus (staphylococcus salivarius), were investigated by comparative oligonucleotide cataloguing of 16s rrna. all the staphylococci investigated form a phylogenetically coherent group at the genus level that, in addition, contains the anaerobic species peptococcus saccharolyticus. the genus staphylococcus belongs to the broad bacillus-lactobacillus-streptococcus cluster that is defined by gram-positive bacteria with a low dna g+c content. micrococcus mucilaginosus is not a genuine member of the genus micrococcus. the binary matching coefficients between the 16s rrna of micrococcus mucilaginosus and those representatives of the arthrobacter/micrococcus group and related genera indicate that micrococcus mucilaginosus should be regarded as a member of a new genus.

AB  == soluble extracellular antigens (esa) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a bio-gel p6 column. soluble cell wall antigens (wea) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 m phosphate buffer (ph 6). antisera against whole cells of s. sanguis and  s. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell  walls, dextran, esa, and wea were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. esa and wea were prepared from a representative strain  of bratthall's seven serological groups, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus. all sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. the comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both esa and wea between the different strains. absorption of anti-esa sera with  wea, and anti-wea sera with esa, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in esa and wea.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

AB  == human teeth were suspended in a basal medium with sucrose 10%; they were incudated for formation of dental plaques "in vitro". the microorganisms used were: strep. mutans, lactobacillus salivarius var. salivarius and a mixture of them. the following aspects were stablishad by scanning electron microscopy: 1) the teeth inoculated with strep. mutans had coccoid forms, lying on an organic film with spheric spaces in some sectors, and irreguar forms in others (fig. 1).  2) the teeth inoculated with lactobacillus salivarius had rod forms attached to the adamantine surface (fig. 2, 3). 3) teeth incubated with the mixutre had rod forms over a granular film (fig. 4). 4) the control teath did not have plaque (fig. 5). this experience shows that the extracellular polisacharide, reticulated or granular (mutano) appeared only in teeth incubated with strep. mutans alone (fig. 1) or mixed with lactobacillus (fig. 4). on the other hand lactobacillus appeared attached on the enamel surfaces, perhaps due to cohesive adhesive forces (fig. 2). two different interpretation or the formation of dental plaques that take place on the enamel free surfaces of teeth are presented.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

TI  == ecology of human oral lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli were found in saliva, on teeth, and on the dorsum of the tongue, the vestibular mucosa, and the hard palate in humans. their proportions in saliva, expressed as percentage of the anaerobically cultivable flora, were 10- to 100-fold higher than those on the tooth surface, but were comparable to those on  the epithelial surfaces. the adherence of lactobacillus casei and l. fermenti to  oral surfaces was compared with that of streptomycin-labeled streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius by using in vitro-cultivated cells. the affinity of both lactobacillus species for the tooth surface was very low compared with that  of s. sanguis but was somewhat higher than that of s. salivarius. the lactobacilli and both streptococcus species adhered to a similar extent to the dorsum of the tongue, whereas the affinity of the lactobacilli and s. salivarius  for the vestibular mucosa was about one-half of that of s. sanguis. the results suggest that the affinity of lactobacilli for oral surfaces significantly influences their proportional distribution in the mouth. the relatively low affinity of lactobacilli for the tooth surface suggests that their recognized association with carious lesions and mechanical appliances under certain conditions may be due primarily to mechanical retention rather than unique growth conditions.
