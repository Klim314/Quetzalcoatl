TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == impact of a complex food microbiota on energy metabolism in the model organism caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is widely used as a model system for research on aging, development, and host-pathogen interactions. little is currently known  about the mechanisms underlying the effects exerted by foodborne microbes. we took advantage of c. elegans to evaluate the impact of foodborne microbiota on well characterized physiological features of the worms. foodborne lactic acid bacteria (lab) consortium was used to feed nematodes and its composition was evaluated by 16s rdna analysis and strain typing before and after colonization of the nematode gut. lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and leuconostoc lactis were identified as the main species and shown to display different worm gut colonization capacities. lab supplementation appeared to decrease nematode lifespan compared to the animals fed with the conventional escherichia coli nutrient source or a probiotic bacterial strain. reduced brood size was also observed in microbiota-fed nematodes. moreover, massive accumulation of lipid droplets was revealed by bodipy staining. altered expression of nhr-49, pept-1, and tub-1 genes, associated with obesity phenotypes, was demonstrated by rt-qpcr. since several pathways are evolutionarily conserved in c. elegans, our results highlight the nematode as a valuable model system to investigate the effects of a complex microbial consortium on host energy metabolism.

TI  == phage-mediated transfer of a dextranase gene in lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and characterization of the enzyme.
AB  == while phages of lactobacilli are extensively studied with respect to their structure and role in the dairy environment, knowledge about phages in bacteria residing in sourdough fermentation is limited. based on the previous finding that the lactobacillus sanfranciscensis phage ev3 carries a putative dextranase gene (dex), we have investigated the distribution of similar dex(+) phages in l. sanfranciscensis, the chance of gene transfer and the properties of the dextranase encoded by phage ev3. l. sanfranciscensis h2a (dex(-)), originally isolated from a wheat sourdough, expressed a dex(+) phenotype upon infection with ev3. the dextranase gene was isolated from the transductant and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. the gene encoded a protein of 801 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight (mw) of 89.09 kda and a calculated pi of 5.62. upon purification aided by a 6-his tag, enzyme kinetic parameters were determined. the km value was 370 mm, and the vmax was calculated in about 16 mumol of glucose released from dextran by 1 mg of enzyme in 1 min in a buffer solution at ph 5.0.  the optimum conditions were 60 degrees c and ph 4.5. the enzyme retained its activity for >3h at 60 degrees c and exhibited only 40% activity at 30 degrees c; the highest homology of 72% was found to a dextranase gene from lactobacillus fermentum phage phipyb5. within 25 l. sanfransiscensis isolates tested, the strain 4b5 carried a similar prophage encoding a dextranase gene. our data suggest a phage-mediated transfer of dextranase genes in the sourdough environment resulting in superinfection-resistant l. sanfranciscensis dex(+) strains with a possible ecological advantage in dextran-containing sourdoughs.

TI  == functional analysis of the n-terminal region of endolysin lyb5 encoded by lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage phipyb5.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5 uses endolysin lyb5 and holin hyb5 to burst the host cell. previous results showed that expression of lyb5 in escherichia coli caused host cell lysis slowly, leading us to suppose that lyb5 could pass the cytoplasmic membrane partly. in this work, the function  of a putative signal peptide (splyb5) at the n-terminal of lyb5 was investigated. in e. coli, the cell adopted a spherical shape during induction of lyb5 protein,  while morphological changes were not observed during expression of the splyb5 truncation, indicating that the splyb5 motif may serve as a functional signal peptide. however, splyb5 was not proteolytically cleaved at the predicted site during the translocation of lyb5, and the expressed lyb5 protein appeared in the  cytoplasm, cytoplasmic membrane and periplasm fractions with the same molecular mass. similar results were obtained using lactococcus lactis as a host to express lyb5. these results indicated that splyb5 could direct lyb5 to the periplasm in a membrane-tethered form, and then release it as a soluble active enzyme into the periplasm. in addition, splyb5 could also drive the fused nucleaseb protein to the extracytoplasm environment in e. coli as well as in l. lactis. we proposed that in gram-negative and gram-positive hosts splyb5 acted as a signal-anchor-release domain, which was firstly identified here by experimental evidences in lactic acid bacteria phages. the application of signal-anchor-release domain for endolysin export in bacteriophages infecting gram-positive and gram-negative hosts was discussed.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from gizzard of local poultry.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of our study was to characterize gizzard lactobacillus fermentum-group strains on the basis of their phenotypic profiles regarding characteristics of lactobacilli. in addition, their in vitro potential  probiotic properties were evaluated. materials and methods: the lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified from gizzard contents of algerian local poultry using criteria of bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology and using methods and criteria of sharpe. the strains were further characterized by tolerance to low ph and bile, coaggregation potential and adhesion to intestinal  mucous. the antagonistic activity against some enterobacteriaceae strains from poultry origin was also evaluated. results and conclusion: among the strains identified, both physiological and biochemical characteristics differed noticeably. the strains coded lp3 and lp10 survived simulated gastrointestinal conditions and were considered to be acid and bile tolerant. the majority of the  strains exhibited antagonistic activity towards escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., shigella spp., salmonella spp and citrobacter spp. the best co-aggregation properties were obtained with two isolates. lb. fermentum lp3 alone showed adherence specificity to the chicken intestinal epithelium.

TI  == protein purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis  of l-arabinose isomerase from lactobacillus fermentum cgmcc2921.
AB  == l-arabinose isomerase (ai) catalyzes the isomerization of l-arabinose to l-ribulose, as well as that of d-galactose to d-tagatose. a thermophilic ai derived from lactobacillus fermentum cgmcc2921 (lfai) was overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). this enzyme was purified to over 95% purity by nickel affinity, mono-q ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. the lfai  protein was crystallized from either 0.1 m bis-tris ph 6.5, 23% peg 3350, 0.3 m nacl (form 1 crystals) or 0.1 m bis-tris ph 6.0, 25% peg monomethyl ether 5000 (form 2 crystals). diffraction data from form 1 lfai crystals were collected to 2.80 a resolution using synchrotron radiation. the form 1 crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group p2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=85.11, b=184.57, c=186.26 a, alpha=beta=gamma=90 degrees . the asymmetric unit contained six lfai subunits, corresponding to a calculated matthews coefficient of 2.29 a3  da(-1) and a solvent content of 46.22%.

TI  == ethenoguanines undergo glycosylation by nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferases at non-natural sites.
AB  == deoxyribosyl transferases and functionally related purine nucleoside phosphorylases are used extensively for synthesis of non-natural deoxynucleosides as pharmaceuticals or standards for characterizing and quantitating dna adducts.  hence exploring the conformational tolerance of the active sites of these enzymes is of considerable practical interest. we have determined the crystal structure at 2.1 a resolution of lactobacillus helveticus purine deoxyribosyl transferase (pdt) with the tricyclic purine 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine (n2,3-ethenoguanine) at the active site. the active site electron density map was compatible with four orientations, two consistent with sites for deoxyribosylation and two appearing to be unproductive. in accord with the crystal structure, lactobacillus helveticus pdt glycosylates the 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine at n7 and n1, with a marked preference for  n7. the activity of lactobacillus helveticus pdt was compared with that of the nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase enzymes (drt type ii) from lactobacillus leichmannii and lactobacillus fermentum, which were somewhat more effective in the deoxyribosylation than lactobacillus helveticus pdt, glycosylating the substrate with product profiles dependent on the ph of the incubation. the purine nucleoside phosphorylase of escherichia coli, also commonly used in ribosylation  of non-natural bases, was an order of magnitude less efficient than the transferase enzymes. modeling based on published active-site structures as templates suggests that in all cases, an active site phe is critical in orienting the molecular plane of the purine derivative. adventitious hydrogen bonding with  additional active site residues appears to result in presentation of multiple nucleophilic sites on the periphery of the acceptor base for ribosylation to give a distribution of nucleosides. chemical glycosylation of o9-benzylated 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine also resulted in n7 and n1 ribosylation. absent from the enzymatic and chemical glycosylations is the natural pattern of n3 ribosylation, verified by comparison of spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with an authentic standard synthesized by an unambiguous route.

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == dietary supplementation of milk fermented with probiotic lactobacillus fermentum  enhances systemic immune response and antioxidant capacity in aging mice.
AB  == although probiotics are known to enhance the host immune response, their roles in modulating immunosenescence, resisting infection, and improving redox homeostasis during aging remain unclear. therefore, the present study was devised in aging mice to assess the antiimmunosenescence potential from the consumption of milk that is fermented with probiotic lactobacillus fermentum mtcc 5898 (lf). we hypothesized that probiotic supplementation would boost immunity, improve antioxidant capacity, and resist severity of pathogenic infection in aging mice.  to test this hypothesis, during a trial period of 2 months, 16-month-old male swiss mice were kept on 3 experimental diets: basal diet (bd), bd supplemented with skim milk, and bd supplemented with probiotic lf-fermented milk. a concurrent analysis of several immunosenescence markers that include neutrophil functions, interleukins profile, inflammation and antibody responses in the intestine as well as analysis of antioxidant enzymes in the liver and red blood cells was performed. neutrophil respiratory burst enzymes and phagocytosis increased significantly in probiotic lf-fed groups, whereas no exacerbation in plasma levels of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha was observed. splenocytes registered increased interferon-gamma but decreased interleukin 4 and interleukin 10 production, whereas humoral antibodies registered decreases in immunoglobulin g1 (igg1)/igg2a ratio and ige levels in the probiotic-fed groups. antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) in lf-fed groups showed increased activities, which were more pronounced in the liver than in red blood cell. an escherichia coli-based infection model in aging mice was also designed to validate the protective attributes of lf. administration of probiotic lf significantly reduced e coli population in organs (intestine, liver, spleen, and peritoneal fluid), as  compared with control groups, by enhancing e coli-specific antibodies and inflammatory proteins. based on these results, it appears that lf supplementation alleviated immunosenescence, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities, and resisted e coli infection in aging mice; thereby, signifying its potential in augmenting healthy aging.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == fresh-cut pineapple as a new carrier of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == due to the increasing interest for healthy foods, the feasibility of using fresh-cut fruits to vehicle probiotic microorganisms is arising scientific interest. with this aim, the survival of probiotic lactic acid bacteria, belonging to lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum species, was monitored on artificially inoculated pineapple pieces throughout storage. the main nutritional, physicochemical, and sensorial parameters of minimally processed pineapples were monitored. finally, probiotic lactobacillus were further investigated for their antagonistic effect against listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 on pineapple plugs. our results show that at eight days of storage, the concentration of l. plantarum and l. fermentum on pineapples pieces ranged between 7.3 and 6.3 log cfu g(-1), respectively, without affecting  the final quality of the fresh-cut pineapple. the antagonistic assays indicated that l. plantarum was able to inhibit the growth of both pathogens, while l. fermentum was effective only against l. monocytogenes. this study suggests that both l. plantarum and l. fermentum could be successfully applied during processing of fresh-cut pineapples, contributing at the same time to inducing a protective effect against relevant foodborne pathogens.

TI  == assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  == probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., and oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. the assays included two probiotic reference strains (lactobacillus  plantarum clc 17 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716). the lactobacillus and pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/l of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and  were capable of surviving at low ph values (ph 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. the ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. adhesion levels of enological lab to caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. in particular, pediococcus pentosaceus cial-86 showed a  high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against e. coli cial-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine lab strain as a potential probiotic.

TI  == probiotic abilities of riboflavin-overproducing lactobacillus strains: a novel promising application of probiotics.
AB  == the probiotic potential of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum strains, capable of overproducing riboflavin, was investigated. the riboflavin production was quantified in co-cultures of lactobacilli and human intestinal epithelial cells, and the riboflavin overproduction ability was confirmed. when milk and yogurt were used as carrier matrices, l. plantarum and l. fermentum strains displayed a significant ability to survive through simulated gastrointestinal transit. adhesion was studied on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. both strains adhered strongly on caco-2 cells, negatively influenced the adhesion of escherichia coli o157:h7, and strongly inhibited the growth of three reference pathogenic microbial strains. resistance to major antibiotics and potential hemolytic activity were assayed. overall, this study reveals that these lactobacillus stains are endowed with promising probiotic properties and thus are candidates for the development of novel functional food which would be both enriched in riboflavin and induce additional health benefits, including a potential in situ riboflavin production, once the microorganisms colonize the host intestine.

TI  == aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  == liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of aureobasidium pullulans. the aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. nine  strains of a. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in thailand. strains rsu 9, rsu 21, and rsu 29, all from clade  11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. these are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. these strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. the structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. liamocins from a. pullulans strains rsu 9 and rsu 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (ic50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal  cell line. liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of enterococcus faecalis, but did  not inhibit strains of lactobacillus fermentum, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, a. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.

TI  == the antibacterial and anti-biofouling performance of biogenic silver nanoparticles by lactobacillus fermentum.
AB  == biofouling is a major challenge in the water industry and public health. silver nanoparticles (agnps) have excellent antimicrobial properties and are considered  to be a promising anti-biofouling agent. a modified method was used to produce small sized and well-dispersed biogenic silver nanoparticles with a mean size of  ~6 nm (bio-ag0-6) using lactobacillus fermentum. the morphology, size distribution, zeta potential and oxidation state of the silver were systematically characterized. determination of minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentration results revealed that biogenic silver bio-ag(0-6) can  effectively suppress the growth of the test bacteria. additionally, the inhibition effects of bio-ag(0-6) on biofilm formation and on established biofilms were evaluated using p. aeruginosa (atcc 27853) as the model bacterium.  the results from microtiter plates and confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that bio-ag(0-6) not only exhibited excellent antibacterial performance but also could control biofilm formation and induce detachment of the bulk of p. aeruginosa biofilms leaving a small residual matrix.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter lactobacillus strains from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component  analysis.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of nslab previously isolated  from long ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses (22 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 lactobacillus paracasei, 3 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus harbinensis, and  2 lactobacillus fermentum). most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. the strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. no isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and bsh activity are unpaired traits. finally, nslab strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with escherichia coli and salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. a multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one l. casei and two l. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.

TI  == function of aspartic acid residues in optimum ph control of l-arabinose isomerase from lactobacillus fermentum.
AB  == l-arabinose isomerase (l-ai) catalyzes the isomerization of l-arabinose to l-ribulose and d-galactose to d-tagatose. most reported l-ais exhibit neutral or  alkaline optimum ph, which is less beneficial than acidophilic ones in industrial d-tagatose production. lactobacillus fermentum l-ai (lfai) is a thermostable enzyme that can achieve a high conversion rate for d-galactose isomerization. however, its biocatalytic activity at acidic conditions can still be further improved. in this study, we report the single- and multiple-site mutagenesis on lfai targeting three aspartic acid residues (d268, d269, and d299). some of the lysine mutants, especially d268k/d269k/d299k, exhibited significant optimum ph shifts (from 6.5 to 5.0) and enhancement of ph stability (half-life time increased from 30 to 62 h at ph 6.0), which are more favorable for industrial applications. with the addition of borate, d-galactose was isomerized into d-tagatose by d268k/d269k/d299k at ph 5.0, resulting in a high conversion rate of 62 %. based on the obtained 3.2-a crystal structure of lfai, the three aspartic acid residues were found to be distant from the active site and possibly did not  participate in substrate catalysis. however, they were proven to possess similar  optimum ph control ability in other l-ai, such as that derived from escherichia coli. this study sheds light on the essential residues of l-ais that can be modified for desired optimum ph and better ph stability, which are useful in d-tagatose bioproduction.

TI  == new gene responsible for para-aminobenzoate biosynthesis.
AB  == folate is an essential cofactor in all living cells for one-carbon transfer reactions. para-aminobenzoate (paba), a building block of folate, is usually derived from chorismate in the shikimate pathway by reactions of aminodeoxychorismate synthase (paba and -b) and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase (pabc). we previously suggested that an alternative pathway for paba biosynthesis would operate in some microorganisms such as lactobacillus fermentum and nitrosomonas europaea since these bacteria showed a prototrophic phenotype to paba despite the fact that there are no orthologs of paba, -b, and -c in their genome databases. in this study, a gene of unknown function, ne1434, was obtained from n. europaea by shotgun cloning using a paba-auxotrophic escherichia coli mutant (deltapababc) as a host. a tracer experiment using [u-(13)c6]glucose suggested that paba was de novo synthesized in the transformant. an e. coli deltapababcdeltaarob mutant carrying the ne1434 gene exhibited a prototrophic phenotype to paba, suggesting that compounds in the shikimate pathway including chorismate were not utilized as substrates by ne1434. moreover, the ct610 gene, an ortholog of ne1434 located in the folate biosynthetic gene cluster in chlamydia trachomatis, also complemented paba-auxotrophic e. coli mutants. taken  together, these results suggest that ne1434 and ct610 participate in paba biosynthesis.

TI  == strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
AB  == a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3,  ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest  co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the  isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.

TI  == molecular cloning, characterization and heterologous expression of bile salt hydrolase (bsh) from lactobacillus fermentum ncdo394.
AB  == bile salt hydrolase (bsh) active probiotic strains hydrolyze bile acid amino conjugates in vivo, which triggers cholesterol consumption in liver to synthesize new bile leading to consequential cholesterol lowering. hence, bile salt hydrolyzing potential was the criterion to select l. fermentum ncdo394 for this study and its gene encoding bsh was identified and cloned. the resulting nucleotide sequence of bsh gene contained an open reading frame (orf) of 978 nucleotides encoding a predicted protein of 325 amino acids with a theoretical pi of 6.39. moreover, deduced bsh protein had high similarity with the bshs of l. fermentum only and also exhibited significant similarity to the pencillin v amidases of other lactobacillus spp. five catalytically important amino acids were highly conserved in l. fermentum bsh while four amino acid motifs around these active sites, were not as consistent as in other bsh proteins. furthermore, l. fermentum bsh gene was sub-cloned into pet-28b(+) vector, and its expression was induced with 0.05 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (iptg) in escherichia coli bl21(de3). the recombinant bsh (rbsh) was purified with homogeneity using ni+2-nta column and characterized for substrate specificity, ph and temperature.  the rbsh hydrolyzed six major human bile salts with a slight preference towards glycine-conjugated bile salts. the optimum ph of rbsh was six, and its enzymatic  activity declined below ph 5 and above ph 7. the enzyme was stable and functional even at 65 degrees c while showed its maximum activity at 37 degrees c. in conclusion, l. fermentum ncdo394 may be a promising candidate probiotic which may affect cholesterol metabolism in vivo.

TI  == in vitro probiotic properties of lactobacillus fermentum sk5 isolated from vagina of a healthy woman.
AB  == a lactobacillus strain isolated from a vaginal tract of a healthy woman was examined in vitro for its probiotic potential. this strain, identified as lactobacillus fermentum sk5, was able to survive at ph 3-4 and 0.1-0.2% bile, and unaffected by pepsin (3 g l(-1)) and pancreatin (1 g l(-1)), but was susceptible  to all tested antibiotics except metronidazole. l. fermentum sk5 had an antimicrobial potential against gastrointestinal pathogenic escherichia coli and  vaginal pathogenic gardnerella vaginalis. the effective substance was suspected to be a bacteriocin-like compound with a molecular weight of more than 10 kda, but hydrogen peroxide was also detected. further studies revealed that l. fermentum sk5 had good autoaggregation characteristic and a high surface hydrophobicity that enhanced its adhesion ability to epithelial cells and for biofilm formation. this lactobacillus showed coaggregation with e. coli and g. vaginalis to affect their adhesion and colonization. the adhesion of l. fermentum sk5 to hela, ht-29 and caco-2 cells and its inhibition of e. coli and g. vaginalis adherence to these cells were demonstrated. these incidences provided evidence of the possible colonization of l. fermentum sk5 that would prevent binding and growth of e. coli and g. vaginalis onto intestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. on the basis of the ability of l. fermentum sk5 to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms through coaggregation and antimicrobial substances, it  is likely that this lactobacillus strain could be a potential probiotic candidate for beneficial use in protecting against gastrointestinal and vaginal microbial infections.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
AB  == purpose: multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. we therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: we used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to  inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both ph-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. results: in the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, l. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against e. faecalis, l. fermentum the most inhibitory against e. coli. a commercially available mixture of 14 strains (bio-kult((r))) was the most effective mixture, against e. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against e. coli. mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. in the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when ph was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral ph. conclusions: both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.

TI  == development of antimicrobial synbiotics using potentially-probiotic faecal isolates of lactobacillus fermentum and bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus fermentum and bifidobacterium longum, isolated from faeces of healthy elderly individuals, against enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (e. coli o157:h7) and enteropathogenic e. coli (e. coli o86), to determine the capability of the selected strains to tolerate acid and bile in vitro, to select suitable carbohydrates in order to enhance the growth and maximise antimicrobial activity of the putative probiotic organisms and examine the adhesion properties of the synbiotics. antimicrobial activity of the putative probiotics and synbiotics was investigated by a microtitre method using cell-free culture supernatants (cfcs). results of the antimicrobial assay showed that both  putative probiotic strains produced compounds at ph 5 that lead to higher lag phases of both e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli o86. when half the quantity of cell-free culture supernatants of both probiotic strains was used at ph 5, b. longum maintained the same antimicrobial effect against both strains of e. coli,  whereas l. fermentum lead to a higher lag phase of e. coli o86 only. neutralization of the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antimicrobial  effect with only cell-free supernatant of l. fermentum causing lower maximum growth rates of e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli o86. l. fermentum appeared to be acid tolerant whereas b. longum was more susceptible to acid and both isolates were bile tolerant. a short chain fructooligosaccharide (scfos) and an isomalto-oligosaccharide (imo) proved to be the most effective substrates, enhancing antimicrobial activity for l. fermentum and b. longum respectively. the adhesion of the synbiotic combinations showed that l. fermentum, exhibited higher percentage of adhesion when grown on glucose and as a synbiotic combination with  scfos whereas b. longum exhibited lowest percentage of adhesion when grown on both glucose and imo.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == influence of different probiotic lactic acid bacteria on microbiota and metabolism of rats with dysbiosis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are often used for prevention and treatment of dysbiosis. however, the action of various strains of lab on metabolism and digestion under these conditions are poorly understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of probiotic lab on metabolism, digestion and microbiota in animals with dysbiosis. after administration of ampicillin and metronidazole male wistar rats, were fed products containing enterococcus faecium l3 (e.f.), lactobacillus fermentum z (l.f.) or milk (control 1). animals in control group 2 were fed milk, after water instead of antibiotics. dyspeptic symptoms disappeared after administration of probiotic compared with control 1. at the end of the experiment, an increase in the content of enterococci and lactobacilli in the proximal part of the small intestine was found in the animals treated with e.f. and l.f., respectively. after the introduction of probiotic enterococci, the quantity of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the intestines of rats increased, and the content of klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli decreased in comparison with the control group 1 and the group fed lactobacilli. the activity of alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase was greater in blood  serum of rats with dysbiosis receiving milk and lactobacilli. intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity increased in the epithelium and chyme in the jejunum of the  animals treated with l. f. and in the chyme only in the animals treated with e. f. thus, the specific effects of different strains of probiotic lab on the microbiota, and on metabolism and digestion of various nutrients were demonstrated.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == functional properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  == twenty-four acid- and bile-tolerant lactobacilli isolates from dairy products were identified and further in vitro characterized for the presence of functional traits potentially useful for probiotic applications, which included desirable and undesirable traits, such as biofilm formation, ability to inhibit intestinal  pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility, and enzyme activity. the majority of examined strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents (streptomycin,  gentamicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin),  except for three strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus with minimal inhibitory concentration levels for streptomycin higher than the microbiological breakpoints (>/=32 mug/ml), which are considered as resistant. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase, and moderate and high beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in nine strains, which were eliminated from further examination together with three isolates showing unsuitable antibiotic resistance. of the remaining 12 isolates, 4 (lactobacillus fermentum 202, lactobacillus gallinarum 7001, l. rhamnosus 183, and lactobacillus plantarum l2-1) manifested an outstanding potential to inhibit selected intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including escherichia coli and salmonella spp., and simultaneously demonstrated strong biofilm-forming capacity. in conclusion, the results of our in vitro experiments showed that the above four strains had a potential probiotic value and met the criteria to be identified as a possible probiotic microorganism, with the necessity of verification through well-designed in vivo experimental, clinical, and technological studies before the strains can be used  as probiotics or as starter probiotic cultures.

TI  == beta-galactosidase with transgalactosylation activity from lactobacillus fermentum k4.
AB  == the laclm beta-galactosidase of lactobacillus fermentum k4 is encoded by 2 consecutive genes, lacl (large subunit) and lacm (small subunit), that share 17 overlapping nucleotides. phylogenetic analysis revealed that this enzyme was closely related to other lactobacillus beta-galactosidases and provided significant insight into its common and distinct characteristics. we cloned both  the lacl and lacm genes of l. fermentum k4 and heterologously expressed each in escherichia coli, although the recombinant enzyme was only functional when both were expressed on the same plasmid. we evaluated the enzymatic properties of this species-specific laclm beta-galactosidase and discovered that it acts as both a hydrolase, bioconverting lactose into glucose and galactose, and a transgalactosylase, generating prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (gos). the recombinant beta-galactosidase showed a broad ph optimum and stability around neutral ph. the optimal temperature and michaelis constant (k(m)) for the substrates o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside and lactose were, respectively, 40 degrees c and 45 to 50 degrees c and 1.31 mm and 27 mm. the enzyme activity was stimulated by some cations such as na(+), k(+), and mg(2)(+). in addition, activity was also enhanced by ethanol (15%, wt/vol). the transgalactosylation activity of l. fermentum k4 beta-galactosidase effectively and rapidly generated  gos, up to 37% of the total sugars from the reaction. collectively, our results suggested that the beta-galactosidase from l. fermentum k4 could be exploited for the formation of gos.

TI  == structure-function relationships of the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids  and their metabolism by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine structure-function relationships of antibacterial phenolic acids and their metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab). methods and results: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 6 hydroxybenzoic and 6 hydroxycinnamic acids were determined with lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hammesii, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as indicator strains. the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids increased at lower ph. a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups enhanced the activity of hydroxybenzoic acids, but had  minor effects on hydroxycinnamic acids. substitution of hydroxyl groups with methoxy groups increased the activity of hydroxybenzoic, but not of hydroxycinnamic, acid. metabolism of chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic or p-hydroxybenzoic acids by l. plantarum, l. hammesii, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri was analysed by lc-dad-ms. furthermore, mics of substrates and metabolites were compared. decarboxylated and/or reduced metabolites of phenolic acids had a lower activity than the substrates. strain-specific metabolism of phenolic acids generally corresponded to resistance. conclusions: the influence of lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of hydroxybenzoic acids is stronger than that of hydroxycinnamic acids.  metabolism of phenolic acids by lab detoxifies phenolic acids. significance and impact of the study: results allow the targeted selection of plant extracts for food preservation, and selection of starter cultures for fermented products.

TI  == effects of two lactobacillus strains on lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.
AB  == background: the hypocholesterolemic effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) have now become an area of great interest and controversy for many scientists. in this study, we evaluated the effects of lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a and lactobacillus fermentum m1-16 on body weight, lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora of rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. methods: forty rats were assigned to four groups and fed either a normal or a high-cholesterol diet. the lab-treated groups received the high-cholesterol diet supplemented with lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a or lactobacillus fermentum m1-16. the rats were sacrificed after a 6-week feeding period. body weights, visceral organ and fat pad weights, serum and liver cholesterol and lipid levels, and fecal cholesterol  and bile acid concentrations were measured. liver lipid deposition and adipocyte  size were evaluated histologically. results: compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet but without lab supplementation, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides levels were significantly decreased in lab-treated rats (p < 0.05), with no significant change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels and liver lipid deposition were significantly decreased in the lab-treated groups (p < 0.05). accordingly, both fecal cholesterol and bile acids levels were significantly increased after lab administration (p < 0.05). intestinal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium colonies were increased while escherichia coli  colonies were decreased in the lab-treated groups. fecal water content was higher in the lab-treated groups. compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet, administration of lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a resulted in decreases in the body weight gain, liver and fat pad weight, and adipocytes size (p < 0.05). conclusions: this study suggests that lab supplementation has hypocholesterolemic effects in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. the ability to lower serum cholesterol varies among lab strains. our strains might be able to improve the intestinal microbial balance and potentially improve intestinal transit time. although the mechanism is largely unknown, l. plantarum 9-41-a may play a role in fat metabolism.

AB  == in the current study, the probiotic potential of approximately 350 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from korean infant feces and kimchi was investigated. common probiotic properties of the bacterial strains, such as acid  tolerance, bile tolerance and adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cells (ht-29 cells), were examined. some strains were found to have immune modulatory and antimicrobial properties. antagonistic activity against a panel of pathogenic bacteria was found to be strain dependent. to evaluate the immune modulatory activity of the strains, lymphocyte interferon (ifn)-gamma secretion was determined in conjunction with cell proliferation. some strains of lactobacillus  gasseri, l. fermentum and l. plantarum exhibited increased ifn-gamma levels and lymphocyte proliferation. to evaluate the effects of these immune modulating lactobacilli on host life span, caenorhabditis elegans was used as an in vivo model. nematodes that were supplied heat-killed lactobacilli as a food source exhibited obvious differences in life span compared with those fed escherichia coli op50. the mean life span (determined as mean percent survival) of worms fed  l. plantarum cjlp133 and l. fermentum la12 was 13.89% and 13.69% greater, respectively, than that of control nematodes after 21 days (p=0.036 and 0.043, respectively). in addition, some of safety profiles, including hemolytic type, gelatin hydration and degradation of urea, were found to be positive. these newly identified lactobacilli hold promise for use as probiotic agents, feed additives  and/or in food applications.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.

TI  == probiotic factors partially improve parameters of 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis in rats.
AB  == certain live bacteria have demonstrated preliminary indications of efficacy for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis. however, probiotic derived supernatants (sn) have yet to be investigated in the mucositis setting. we evaluated sn from escherichia coli nissle 1917 (ecn) and lactobacillus fermentum br11 (br11) for their capacity to decrease 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)-induced damage in vivo. female dark agouti rats were gavaged with 1 ml of  either sn or vehicle daily (days 0-8) and intraperitoneally injected with 5-fu (150 mg/kg) on day 5 to induce mucositis. on day 9, animals were culled and intestinal tissues collected. significantly lower histological damage scores were apparent in the jejunum of 5-fu treated rats receiving sn compared to 5-fu controls. myeloperoxidase levels in the jejunum of 5-fu treated rats were increased in vehicle and br11 sn treatments compared to untreated controls, whereas no significant increase was observed after ecn sn treatment. 5-fu treatment significantly reduced villus height and crypt depth in the jejunum compared to normal controls; however no significant reduction in these parameters was observed in 5-fu treated rats receiving either sn. we conclude that bacterial sn, especially ecn, partially protect the intestine from 5-fu mucositis. further  studies are required to define specific mechanisms by which sn exert their beneficial effects.

TI  == characterisation of lactobacillus fermentum sm-7 isolated from koumiss, a potential probiotic bacterium with cholesterol-lowering effects.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been demonstrated to have cholesterol-reducing effects in many studies. results: lactobacillus fermentum sm-7 screened from ten lab strains isolated from koumiss, a fermented milk drink, reduced cholesterol by 66.8%. it also showed acid and bile tolerance as well as antimicrobial activity against pathogenic escherchia coli and staphylococcus aureus. lactobacillus fermentum sm-7 cells assimilated 61.5% and co-precipitated  and absorbed 38.5% of the cholesterol in the media. co-precipitation of cholesterol with cholic acid increased rapidly at ph levels below 6. in vivo experiments using l. fermentum sm-7 on artificially induced hyperlipidaemial icr  mice significantly decreased serum total cholesterol and total triglyceride levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and atherogenic index  (p < 0.01), while serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not increase significantly (p > 0.05). the body weight and liver weight/body weight ratio of sm-7 groups were lower than those of mice on a high-cholesterol diet that were not given lactobacilli. there was no bacterial translocation in the liver, spleen or kidney of experimental mice. conclusion: the results suggested that l. fermentum sm-7 is a potential probiotic bacterium with cholesterol-lowering effects.

TI  == bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
AB  == reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems  demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on  cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia  coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c  respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin  was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.

TI  == functional characteristics of lactobacillus fermentum f1.
AB  == in this study, lactobacillus fermentum (l. fermentum) f1 reduced cholesterol 48.87%. the strain was screened from cattle feces using an api 50 chl system and  the 16s rrna sequence contrasting method. l. fermentum f1 showed acid and bile tolerance, and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. l. fermentum f1 deconjugated 0.186 mm of free cholalic acid after it was incubated at 37 degrees c in 0.20% sodium taurocholate (tca) broth for 24 h. heat-killed and resting cells of l. fermentum f1 showed small amounts of cholesterol removal (6.85 and 25.19 mg/g, respectively, of dry weight) compared with growing cells (33.21 mg/g of dry weight). the supernatant fluid of  the broth contained 50.85% of the total cholesterol, while the washing buffer and cell extracts had 13.53 and 35.39%, respectively. these findings suggest that l.  fermentum f1 may remove cholesterol by co-precipitating with deconjugated bile salt, assimilating with cells and by incorporation into cellular membranes. cholesterol assimilated by cells held 72.0% of the reduced cholesterol, while 21.65% of the reduced cholesterol was coprecipitated with deconjugated bile salt  and 5.89% was adsorbed into the surface of the cells.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

TI  == vaginal colonization and activity of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus fermentum l23 in a murine model of vaginal tract infection.
AB  == a strain of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus fermentum l23, was selected from among 100 strains isolated from vaginal swabs of healthy, non-pregnant, pre-menopausal women. l. fermentum l23 was chosen on the basis of its bacteriocinogenic ability and its properties relevant to colonization, i.e. self-aggregation, adherence to vaginal epithelial cells and co-aggregation with bacterial pathogens. the antimicrobial preventative and curative effects produced by the probiotic l. fermentum l23 administered locally against escherichia coli in a murine vaginal tract infection model were studied. one dose of the human strain l23 containing 10(8) c.f.u. ml(-1) colonized and persisted in the vaginal  tract of the female balb/c mice for 5 days. infection with the pathogen at 10(6)  c.f.u. ml(-1) in the vaginal tract was maintained for more than 7 days. a single  dose of l23 administered 24 h pre-infection inhibited e. coli growth on day 3 post-infection, showing the preventative effect displayed by this lactobacillus strain. treatment with l. fermentum l23 during the post-infection period showed complete inhibition of pathogen growth from day 5. thus, this in vivo study indicated that the probiotic bacterium l. fermentum l23 produced both preventative and curative effects on e. coli growth. the beneficial properties and the production of antimicrobial metabolites may act in situ to inhibit a pathogenic micro-organism within the vaginal environment. strain l23 could be a good natural alternative to other therapies used for genital infections.

TI  == intestinal microbiota differentially affect brush border enzyme activity and gene expression in the neonatal gnotobiotic pig.
AB  == to study microbial influence on intestinal development pertaining to nutrient digestion, two separate gnotobiotic experiments were performed, each with 16 piglets allocated to four treatment groups: germfree (gf), monoassociation with escherichia coli, monoassociation with lactobacillus fermentum or conventionalization with faecal bacteria (cv). enzyme activity and gene expression of lactase phlorizin hydrolase (lph) and aminopeptidase n (apn) were measured in isolated enterocytes, harvested on day 14, using specific substrates  and quantitative pcr respectively. enterocytes of cv pigs had reduced apn activity, but had increased gene expression relative to gf, making the specific activity:mrna (a:g) ratio dramatically lower (p < 0.05). similarly, lph a:g ratio was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in enterocytes of cv pigs as compared with gf. the results of co-incubation of l. fermentum, e. coli and faecal bacteria with apn indicate a direct relationship between enzyme inactivation and specific  a:g ratio in enterocytes. we conclude that enterocyte up-regulation of apn expression occurs as either a direct response to microbial colonization or as a feedback mechanism in response to reduced enzyme activity through microbial degradation. this mechanism may play a role in ensuring effective competition of  the host with the intestinal microbiota for available nutrients.

AB  == synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. however, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition  has not been determined. eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four  probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h ph-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. the prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using fish. rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides group. lower levels of escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10  h of fermentation. probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of lactobacillus-enterococcus were observed when the  probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.

TI  == in vivo reshaping the catalytic site of nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase for dideoxy- and didehydronucleosides via a single amino acid substitution.
AB  == nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of 2-deoxyribose between bases and have been widely used as biocatalysts to synthesize a variety of nucleoside analogs. the genes encoding nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase (ndt) from lactobacillus leichmannii and lactobacillus fermentum underwent random mutagenesis to select variants specialized for the synthesis of 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides. an escherichia coli strain, auxotrophic for uracil and  unable to use 2',3'-dideoxyuridine, cytosine, and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine as a source of uracil was constructed. randomly mutated lactobacilli ndt libraries from two species, l. leichmannii and l. fermentum, were screened for the production of uracil with 2',3'-dideoxyuridine as a source of uracil. several mutants suitable for the synthesis of 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides were isolated. the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding genes revealed a single mutation (g -->  a transition) leading to the substitution of a small aliphatic amino acid by a nucleophilic one, a15t (l. fermentum) or g9s (l. leichmannii), respectively. we concluded that the "adaptation" of the nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase activity to 2,3-dideoxyribosyl transfer requires an additional hydroxyl group on  a key amino acid side chain of the protein to overcome the absence of such a group in the corresponding substrate. the evolved proteins also display significantly improved nucleoside 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyribosyltransferase activity.

AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == antagonistic activities of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21), l. casei atcc 27216, and l. acidophilus atcc 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards e. coli strain k12, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis test cultures were studied. the bactericidal effect of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (ph 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. adhesion of c. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if  the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.

TI  == the adhesion of putative probiotic lactobacilli to cultured epithelial cells and  porcine intestinal mucus.
AB  == aims: to investigate the adhesion of lactobacilli and their subsequent competitive exclusion ability against pathogens. methods and results: four species of putative probiotic lactobacilli were studied for their adhesion abilities. first, the adhesion to caco-2 cells was examined by light and electron microscopy. the four species were then labelled by [methyl-(3)h] thymidine and their adhesion to porcine intestinal mucus was determined by radioactivity. the tested lactobacilli showed best adhesion on ileal mucus compared with duodenal and jejunal mucus. oxidative compound pre-treatment (naio(3) and naio(4)) dramatically decreased the adhesion of the lactobacilli to mucus. pre-treating mucus with proteolytic enzymes (proteinase k and trypsin) resulted in the increase of adhesion in lactobacillus serotype reuteri i2021, but the results in  the other species were variable. lactobacillus serotype fermentum i5007 showed greatest adhesion potential and exerted the best competitive exclusion against salmonella and escherichia. conclusions: adhesion ability in lactobacilli is species-specific. lactobacilli with higher adhesion index have better competitive exclusion ability. significance and impact of the study: this study suggests that there is a positive correlation between adhesion and competitive exclusion ability of lactobacilli. additionally, the in vitro adhesion assay is a feasible  way to screen unknown lactobacilli, potentially for future industrial applications.

TI  == technological properties of lactobacillus fermentum involved in the processing of dolo and pito, west african sorghum beers, for the selection of starter cultures.
AB  == aim: technological properties of lactobacillus fermentum isolates involved in spontaneous fermentation of dolo and pito wort were examined to select starter cultures. methods and results: 264 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity, acidifying activity, exopolysaccharides (epss) and amylase production.  an antimicrobial activity was detected for 33.3%, 31.8%, 22.7% and 15.9% of the isolates towards staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin a producer, staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin a and b producer, escherichia coli and listeria innocua, respectively. a similarity was found between the isolates which were clustered in four groups according to their rates of acidification of sorghum malt broth. the  faster acidifying group of isolates (43.48%) had a rate of acidification evaluated as delta ph of 1.14 +/- 0.15 ph unit after 6 h of fermentation, followed by a second group of isolates (38.08%) with a similar rate of acidification after 9 h of fermentation. from the isolates endowed with an antimicrobial activity, 5.76% belonged to the faster acidifying group and 40.38%  belonged to the second group. 88.7% of the isolates had the ability for producing epss but not amylase. conclusion: lactobacillus fermentum ferments dolo and pito  wort by lowering the ph and providing organic acids, epss and antimicrobial compounds. significance and impact of the study: strains with a rapid rate of acidification, an antimicrobial activity and producing epss are suggested to have potential for starter cultures.

TI  == enterocyte proliferation and apoptosis in the caudal small intestine is influenced by the composition of colonizing commensal bacteria in the neonatal gnotobiotic pig.
AB  == we previously reported marked differences in small intestinal morphology, including changes in crypt depth and villous height, after inoculation of germ-free pigs with different bacterial species. in an attempt to identify the mechanisms governing changes in villous morphology associated with bacterial colonization, 2 gnotobiotic experiments were performed. in each experiment, 16 piglets were allocated to 4 treatment groups including germ-free (gf), monoassociation with lactobacillus fermentum (lf) or escherichia coli (ec), or conventionalized with sow feces (sf). piglets were reared under gnotobiotic conditions until 14 d of age, at which time whole intestinal tissue and enterocytes were collected for histological, gene expression, and protein analysis. proliferating cell nuclear antigen, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha), fas ligand (fasl), cd3epsilon, caspase 3 (casp3), and toll-like receptors (tlr)2, 4, and 9 expression were measured by quantitative pcr. activated casp3 was measured by western blot. increased abundance of activated casp3 and transcripts encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigen, tnfalpha, cd3epsilon, and fasl was observed in sf and ec treatment groups compared with gf  and lf. expression of tlr2 was increased (p < 0.05) in the sf treatment and tended to be greater (p < 0.08) in ec relative to lf and gf. results indicate that conventional bacteria and e. coli but not l. fermentum increase overall cell turnover by stimulating increased apoptosis through the expression of fasl and tnfalpha and by increasing cell proliferation. the differential regulation of tlr expression indicates that microbially induced changes may be mediated in part by  these receptors. induction of inflammatory responses and activation of apoptosis  through death receptors appears to play a significant role in enterocyte turnover mediated by commensal bacteria.

TI  == commensal bacteria and expression of two major intestinal chemokines, teck/ccl25  and mec/ccl28, and their receptors.
AB  == background: ccl25/teck and ccl28/mec are cc chemokines primarily expressed in thymic dendritic cells and mucosal epithelial cells. their receptors, ccr9 and ccr10, are mainly expressed on t and b lymphocytes. in human, mouse, pig and sheep ccl25 and ccl28 play an important role in the segregation and the compartmentalization of the mucosal immune system. as evidenced by early comparisons of germ-free and conventional animals, the intestinal bacterial microflora has a marked effect on host intestinal immune functions. however, little is known about the impact of bacterial colonization on constitutive and induced chemokine expressions as well as on the generation of anti-inflammatory mechanisms. methodology/principal findings: therefore, we decided to focus by qpcr on the mrna expression of two main gut chemokines, ccl25 and ccl28, their receptors ccr9 and ccr10, the tregs marker foxp3 and anti-inflammatory cytokines  tgf-beta and il-10 following colonization with different bacterial species within the small intestine. to accomplish this we used an original germ-free neonatal pig model and monoassociated pigs with a representative gram-negative (escherichia coli) or gram-positive (lactobacillus fermentum) commensal bacteria  commonly isolated from the neonatal pig intestine. our results show a consistent  and marked effect of microbial colonization on the mrna expression of intestinal  chemokines, chemokine receptors, foxp3 and tgf-beta. moreover, as evidenced by in vitro experiments using two different cell lines, the pattern of regulation of ccl25 and ccl28 expression in the gut appears complex and suggests an additional  role for in vivo factors. conclusions/significance: taken together, the results highlight the key role of bacterial microflora in the development of a functional intestinal immune system in an elegant and relevant model for human immune system development.

TI  == different probiotic properties for lactobacillus fermentum strains isolated from  swine and poultry.
AB  == systematic procedures were used to evaluate the probiotic properties of lactobacillus fermentum (l. fermentum) strains isolated from swine and poultry. the major properties included their capabilities to adhere to the intestinal epithelium of swine and poultry, the inhibition on pathogenic bacteria, and their tolerance to the gastric juice and bile salts. results showed that l. fermentum strains from poultry digestive tract showed better adherence to the swine intestine and chicken crop epithelial cells as compared to those strains from the swine origin. in addition, six strains from poultry and one strain from swine showed adhesion specificity to their own intestinal epithelium. four poultry isolates and one swine isolate were able to adhere to the epithelial cells from both swine and chicken. for gastric juice and bile tolerance, most of the strains isolated from swine or poultry were acid tolerant but less strains were bile intolerant. the spent culture supernatant (scs) of these l. fermentum strains showed antagonistic effect against the indicator bacteria, such as escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella sonnei and some enterotoxigenic staphylococcus aureus. from the above studies, some l. fermentum strains isolated from poultry were found to have the probiotic properties required for use in animal feed supplement. this study suggested that poultry digestive tract may serve as potential source for the isolation of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == effects of bacterial colonization on the porcine intestinal proteome.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex community of bacteria, of which many may be beneficial. studies of germ-free animal models have shown that the gastrointestinal microbiota not only assists in making nutrients available for the host but also contributes to intestinal health and development. we studied small intestinal protein expression patterns in gnotobiotic pigs maintained germ-free, or monoassociated with either lactobacillus fermentum or non-pathogenic escherichia coli. a common reference design in combination with labeling with stable isobaric tags allowed the individual comparison of 12 animals. our results showed that bacterial colonization differentially affected mechanisms such as proteolysis, epithelial proliferation, and lipid metabolism, which is in good agreement with previous studies of other germ-free animal models. we have also found that e. coli has a profound effect on actin remodeling and intestinal proliferation, which may be related to stimulated migration and turnover of enterocytes. regulations related to l. fermentum colonization involved individual markers for immunoregulatory mechanisms.

TI  == effects of commensal bacteria on intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the gnotobiotic pig.
AB  == a germ-free neonatal pig model was established to determine the effects of bacterial colonization by different species on small intestinal morphology and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. two experimental groups of 16 pigs were aseptically delivered by cesarian section and allocated into 4 gnotobiotic isolators. pigs were either maintained germ-free (gf), or were orally inoculated  with either a single strain of nonpathogenic escherichia coli (ec) or lactobacillus fermentum (lf) or conventionalized with adult porcine feces (cv). after 13 days tissue samples were collected at 5 regions corresponding to 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% of the small intestine (si) length. in experiment 2, the gf isolator became contaminated with staphylococcus epidermidis (se). in general, intestinal responses to bacterial colonization were similar among gf, lf, and se  pigs, and intestinal responses in ec pigs were more similar to cv pigs. responses to bacterial colonization were most pronounced in the distal si regions (50%-95%), suggesting that nonmicrobial factors may be more important in the proximal si. relative to cv pigs, the distal intestines of gf, lf, and se pigs were characterized by long villi, shallow crypts, increased relative intestinal mass, and decreased lamina propria cellularity, whereas si morphology was intermediate in ec pigs. relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (il-1beta ) and il-6 generally increased distally in the si and was highest in ec and cv pigs. we observed regional variation in si morphology and proinflammatory cytokine expression, which differed with bacterial species. this study demonstrates that bacterial species differentially affect intestinal morphology and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and suggests that neonatal bacterial colonization patterns may have long-term effects on intestinal health and development.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of four lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk.
AB  == aims: the antimicrobial potential of four lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius  cect5713, lactobacillus gasseri cect5714, l. gasseri cect5715 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716), isolated from fresh human breast milk, was evaluated in this study and compared with lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711, a reuterin-producing strain isolated from an artisan goat's cheese. methods and results: agar diffusion tests, competitive adhesion assays and mucin expression assays were carried out in order to value the antibacterial properties of the lactobacilli strains. the antibacterial capability of the strains was tested in vivo by using  a murine infection model with salmonella choleraesuis. the results revealed that  all the strains studied, displayed antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria. however, the antibacterial potential varied among the lactobacilli tested and, in fact, l. salivarius cect5713 showed not only the best in vitro antibacterial activity, but also the highest protective effect against a salmonella strain in the murine infection model. conclusion: the four breast-milk lactobacilli, and particularly l. salivarius cect5713, possess potent antibacterial activities that result in a higher protection against s. choleraesuis cect4155 in a mouse infection model. significance and impact of the  study: these results suggest that lactobacilli from breast milk could contribute  to an anti-infective protection in neonates and would be excellent candidates for the development of infant probiotic products.

AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus isolates on the adhesion of pathogens to chicken intestinal mucus in vitro.
AB  == aims: the aims of this study were to investigate in vitro the effects of lactobacillus isolates from a chicken on adhesion of pathogenic salmonella and escherichia coli to chicken intestinal mucus obtained from different intestinal regions. methods and results: bacteria were labelled by using methyl-1,2-[(3)h]-thymidine. the bacterial adhesion was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of bacteria adhered to the mucus. the results showed that the abilities of lactobacillus spp. to bind to the same intestinal mucus were higher  than those of pathogenic salmonella and e. coli. pretreatment of intestinal mucus with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus, alone or in combination, reduced the adhesion of the tested pathogens, but the reductive extent of pathogenic adhesion by lactobacillus spp. in combination was relatively high. conclusions: the tested bacteria had different adhesions to mucus glycoproteins isolated from different intestinal regions of chicken. lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum in combination revealed a better ability to inhibit attachments of salmonella and e. coli to chicken intestinal mucus than lactobacillus sp. alone. significance and impact of the study: a mixture of intestinal lactobacillus spp. from a chicken may play a protective role in excluding pathogenic salmonella and e. coli from the intestine of chicken.

TI  == glucan synthesis in the genus lactobacillus: isolation and characterization of glucansucrase genes, enzymes and glucan products from six different strains.
AB  == members of the genera streptococcus and leuconostoc synthesize various alpha-glucans (dextran, alternan and mutan). in lactobacillus, until now, the only glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzyme that has been characterized is gtfa of lactobacillus reuteri 121, the first gtf enzyme synthesizing a glucan (reuteran)  that contains mainly alpha-(1-->4) linkages together with alpha-(1-->6) and alpha-(1-->4,6) linkages. recently, partial sequences of glucansucrase genes were detected in other members of the genus lactobacillus. this paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of dextransucrase and mutansucrase genes and enzymes from various lactobacillus species and the characterization of  the glucan products synthesized, which mainly have alpha-(1-->6)- and alpha-(1-->3)-glucosidic linkages. the four gtf enzymes characterized from three  different lb. reuteri strains are highly similar at the amino acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very alike. interestingly, these four lb. reuteri gtfs have relatively large n-terminal variable regions, containing rdv repeats, and relatively short putative glucan-binding domains with conserved  and less-conserved yg-repeating units. the three other gtf enzymes, isolated from lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus parabuchneri, contain smaller variable regions and larger putative glucan-binding domains compared to the lb. reuteri gtf enzymes.

AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == antimicrobial interactions of microbial species involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima with particular reference to the inhibitory effect of lactic acid bacteria on enteric pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, bacillus species and yeasts are involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima. microbial interactions within and between these groups of microorganisms were investigated in addition to the survival of five enteric pathogens inoculated into agbelima under various conditions. nine out of 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the end of agbelima fermentation showed inhibitory effect against 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the start of fermentation. only 3 out of 10 isolates of bacillus subtilis were inhibited by 10 isolates of lactic acid bacteria tested. no interactions were observed between yeasts and the lactic acid bacteria, whereas three of the bacillus isolates showed inhibitory effects against the yeasts. twelve isolates of lactobacillus plantarum tested inhibited the growth of an isolate each of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis but none tested positive for bacteriocin production. the antimicrobial effect of the lactic acid bacteria was attributed to acid production. in fermenting cassava dough, enteric pathogens survived to different extents depending on ph and their  sensitivity to acids. vibrio cholerae c-230, salmonella typhimurium 9 and salmonella enteritidis 226 were not detectable in 10 g of sample after 4 h when inoculated into the 48-h fermented product, agbelima, whereas shigella dysenteriae 2357t and escherichia coli d2188 were detectable up to 8 h in the product.

AB  == the sesquiterpenoids nerolidol, farnesol, bisabolol, and apritone were investigated for their abilities to enhance bacterial permeability and susceptibility to exogenous antimicrobial compounds. initially, it was observed by flow cytometry that these sesquiterpenoids promoted the intracellular accumulation of the membrane-impermeant nucleic acid stain ethidium bromide by live cells of lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting that enhanced permeability resulted from disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. the ability of these sesquiterpenoids to increase bacterial susceptibility to a number of clinically important antibiotics was then investigated. in disk diffusion assays, treatment  with low concentrations (0.5 to 2 mm) of nerolidol, bisabolol, or apritone enhanced the susceptibility of staphylococcus aureus to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and vancomycin. nerolidol and farnesol also sensitized escherichia coli to polymyxin b. our results indicate the practical utility of sensitizing bacteria to antimicrobials with sesquiterpenoids that have traditionally been used as flavorants and aroma compounds in the food and perfume industries.

TI  == structural and ultrastructural studies of the urinary tract of mice inoculated with lactobacillus fermentum.
AB  == objective: to assess, using structural and ultrastructural studies of the urinary tract, the effects of the intraurethral inoculation of lactobacilli (probiotic treatment) as lactobacilli are the predominant micro-organisms of the urogenital  tract of humans, monkeys and mice. materials and methods: previous work showed the protective effect of lactobacillus fermentum crl 1058 intraurethrally inoculated against the challenge of uropathogenic escherichia coli. there was also an effect of oestrogens and antibiotics in the kinetics of colonization of both micro-organisms in mice. in the present study l. fermentum was inoculated with agarose beads (107 colony-forming units) and the number of micro-organisms determined by plating in selective media, giving a high degree of colonization in all the organs studied. the urinary tract organs were processed by histological and electron microscopy techniques standardized in our laboratory. results: the intraurethral inoculation of lactobacilli produced no adverse effects or significant changes in any of the organs assessed (kidney, ureter, bladder or urethra), when evaluated by histological and ultrastructural techniques. conclusion: the use of lactobacilli as a probiotic treatment is probably safe.

TI  == isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7  were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman  rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure  colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels  of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus fermentum kc5b and its use for constructing a stable lactobacillus cloning vector.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum kc5b, a strain originally isolated from the human vagina, contains a cryptic plasmid pkc5b. the sequence and genetic organization of the 4392-bp plasmid were determined. it contains two convergently oriented replicons, which are homologous to each other and to the stable replicon of the enterococcus faecium plasmid pmbb1. the two replicons of pkc5b were used either individually or together to construct lactobacillus-escherichia coli shuttle plasmids. only the plasmid psp1 that carried both replicons transformed lactobacilli, suggesting a complementary function between the two replicons. since the replicons had a high homology to those of other plasmids that replicate via a theta-like mechanism and no detectable single-stranded intermediates were found for the plasmid, it is possible that pkc5b may replicate via a theta-like mechanism. the  new shuttle plasmid psp1 has been transformed and stably maintained in several lactobacillus strains. as an initial application, psp1 was used to clone the s-layer protein gene (slpa) of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 into a heterologous vaginal lactobacillus strain and achieved surface-bound expression of the protein.

AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == experimental administration of estradiol on the colonization of lactobacillus fermentum and escherichia coli in the urogenital tract of mice.
AB  == the effect of estrogen on the microbial colonization of the urogenital tract is widely discussed, mainly in regard to women with a high incidence of urinary tract infections (uti). the aim of this work was to study the effect of estradiol on the microbial colonization of lactobacilli and e. coli in mice. female balb/c  mice were intramuscularly (i.m.) treated with beta-estradiol (one or three doses). the next day, l. fermentum was inoculated intraurethrally with three doses of 10(7) cfu (colony forming units). later, mice were challenged with uropathogenic e. coli (1 x 10(8) cfu). the hormone levels in sera increased to values 10 times higher than in control animals. increased differentiation of desquamated vaginal cells and keratinization of the vaginal surface were also observed. the hormonal treatment produced an increased e. coli colonization in the whole tract and a higher level of l. fermentum in kidneys on the 6th day. in  mice treated with hormones and lactobacilli, one dose of estradiol was enough to  protect animals against the challenge with e. coli. three doses of estradiol produced a more pronounced protection with a lower number of e. coli. no histological modifications were produced by l.fermentum, while lymphocytic proliferation at submucosal level was observed in e. coli-challenged animals.

TI  == reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with  the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked  by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and  l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in  fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of  feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly  improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.

TI  == cloning of erythromycin-resistance determinants and replication origins from indigenous plasmids of lactobacillus reuteri for potential use in construction of cloning vectors.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri l1 and n16 strains contain a 7.0-kb plasmid (pte80) and a 15-kb plasmid (pte15), respectively, encoding resistance to erythromycin (em(r)). physical maps of both plasmids were established. nucleotide sequences of the genetic determinants encoding em(r) on pte80 and pte15 revealed the existence of  a very similar (ca. 99% nucleotide sequence and ca. 98% amino acid sequence identity) open reading frame for an em(r) transmethylase gene (erm) in both plasmids. these structural erm genes, 753 and 750 bp in length, respectively, were highly related (ca. 98% nucleotide sequence and ca. 97% amino acid sequence  identity) to the erm gene of l. fermentum plasmid plem3. sequence analysis showed that these two erm genes from pte80 and pte15 could be categorized under the ermb (ermam) class. these are the first members of the ermb (ermam) class of em(r) determinant from l. reuteri to be characterized at the nucleotide sequence level. the em(r) gene from pte80 (erm80) was then ligated into puc18/19 to construct replication origin (ro)-screening vectors pue80(+) and pue80(-) (pue80(+/-)). these plasmids contain the puc18/19-derived multiple cloning site, ampicillin-resistance trait, and the lacz' gene, which enable direct screening for recombinants in escherichia coli. once the recombinant contains a ro from l.  reuteri, the em(r) trait of erm80 is used as a selection marker for the replication of the chimeric plasmid as it is transformed into l. reuteri using the cloned ro as a replicon. replication regions from pte80 and pte15 were successfully cloned into the constructed vector pue80(-). the ro cloned from pte80 was further identified as being highly stable in l. reuteri and also bearing a relatively narrow host range compared with that of pte15. the em(r) determinant (erm80) and ro cloned from pte80 could be used in the future construction of derivatives of cloning vectors for this microbe. moreover, the pue80(+/-) and pte80-ro constructed in this study have the potential to be developed as a suicide vector and an e. coli-l. reuteri shuttle vector, respectively.

TI  == the bspa locus of lactobacillus fermentum br11 encodes an l-cystine uptake system.
AB  == bspa is a basic surface-exposed protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11. sequence comparisons have shown that it is a member of family iii of the solute binding proteins. it is 89% identical to the collagen binding protein, cnb, from  lactobacillus reuteri. compared with the database of escherichia coli proteins, bspa is most similar to the l-cystine binding protein fliy. to investigate the function of bspa, mutants depleted for bspa were generated by homologous recombination with a temperature-sensitive plasmid. these mutants were significantly impaired in their abilities to take up l-cystine. uptake rates of l-glutamine, l-histidine, and l-lysine, which are substrates for other binding proteins with similarity to bspa, were unaffected. evidence was obtained that bspa is necessary for maximal resistance to oxidative stress. specifically, inactivation of bspa causes defective growth in the presence of oxygen and sensitivity to paraquat. measurements of sulfhydryl levels showed that incubation of l. fermentum br11 with l-cystine resulted in increased levels of sulfhydryl groups both inside and outside the cell; however, this was not the case with a bspa mutant. the role of bspa as an extracellular matrix protein adhesin was also addressed. l. fermentum br11 does not bind to immobilized type i collagen or laminin above background levels but does bind immobilized fibronectin. inactivation of bspa did not significantly affect fibronectin binding; therefore, we have not found evidence to support the notion that bspa is an extracellular matrix protein binding adhesin. as bspa is most probably not a lipoprotein, this  report provides evidence that gram-positive bacterial solute binding proteins do  not necessarily have to be anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane to function in solute uptake.

AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

AB  == the influence of bacillus intermedius rnaase on the multiplication on b.b.bifidum, l.fermentum and e. coli was studied. the study revealed that the stimulating action depended on the dose of the enzyme, the microbial species and  the growth phase of the inoculate. rnaase, added to the nutrient medium, was shown to induce the acceleration of the synthesis of dna, rna, protein, as well as mitosis. at the same time the stimulating action of rnaase was accompanied not only by the reduction of the duration of the lag phase, but in some cases even by an increase in the specific growth rate.

TI  == purification and characterization of a component produced by lactobacillus fermentum that inhibits the adhesion of k88 expressing escherichia coli to porcine ileal mucus.
AB  == it has previously been shown that lactobacillus fermentum strain 104r releases compounds into its culture fluid that inhibit the adhesion of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli k88. the aim of the present study was to purify and identify this compound. judged by gel filtration, the compound was found to be approximately 1700 kda. the amount of active compound increased upon prolonged incubation, while the number of viable cells reduced, suggesting that the activity was coming from dead cells. as the activity can be destroyed by lysozyme treatment and contains glucose, n-acetylglucosamine and galactose, it was concluded that cell wall fragments are the active agent, although cell wall preparations did not have the same effect. adhesion to some mucus fractions could be inhibited by spent culture fluid, indicating specific interaction between mucus and the active compound. the compound was not able to interfere with the adhesion of e. coli 1107 to neutral lipids from mucus which contain a glycolipid  receptor for k88 fimbriae.

TI  == the potential of lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  == oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). the adjuvant function of different lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. after  i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high dth responses were observed with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in different experimental model systems l. casei and l. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. a series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the l. casei l-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (pouwels and leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. lactobacilli synthesizing the  fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous  priming.

TI  == effect of lactobacilli and antibiotics on e. coli urinary infections in mice.
AB  == urinary antibiotic treatments usually affect the normal urethral flora. this work was developed in order to evaluate whether lactobacillus fermentum crl 1058 could reduce urinary tract infections (uti) produced by uropathogenic escherichia coli  in mice treated with antimicrobial agents. animals were inoculated intra-urethrically with agarose beads containing lactobacilli, and were challenged with e. coli. ampicillin (13 mg/kg/dose) was administered orally. the  number of microorganisms present at different days was evaluated in the urogenital tract. serum inflammatory and systemic immune response were also registered. the use of 5 doses of ampicillin after 3 doses of lactobacilli in agarose beads significantly affected the viability of lactic acid bacteria, while the amount of e. coli was not altered. lactate dehidrogenase (ldh) activity and anti-e. coli antibody levels showed no statistically significant difference between the challenged and non-challenged mice. lactobacilli reinoculation and 3  doses of ampicillin proved to be a moderately effective treatment since a smaller amount of e. coli was recovered from the organs of treated mice than from the controls. the reinforcement of lactobacilli, administered on the 9th day, produced a faster elimination of the pathogen. the ampicillin dose used allowed lactobacilli permanence in the urinary tract, and caused the elimination of the pathogen. serum ldh values seemed to show an inflammatory immune response. no successful preventive results could be achieved. we can conclude that lactobacilli and adequately low doses of ampicillin have a positive effect on the treatment of e. coli in this uti model.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus spp. on the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to isolated porcine enterocytes.
AB  == a total of 43 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the time of weaning. isolates, grown on solid media, were allocated to strongly adherent or non/weakly adherent groups on the basis of numbers attaching to isolated porcine enterocytes. strains of lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and lact. acidophilus and lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture. strongly adherent strains were not found to effect the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to porcine enterocytes, tested under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli added to the enterocytes before e. coli), competition (lactobacilli and e. coli added simultaneously) and displacement (e. coli added before lactobacilli). tests were made with [14c]-labelled e. coli. suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of e. coli attachment. some strains  of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic e. coli with k88 fimbriae, but  not with a k88-negative mutants strain. these were excluded from the competitive  exclusion experiments. in the apparent absence of a direct effect on the association of e. coli with host tissue, removal of potential gut pathogens by aggregation could contribute to the probiotic properties ascribed to lactic acid  bacteria.

TI  == [studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  == the locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and electron microscopy in  peptostreptococcus productus, clostridium sp. hd-17, lactobacillus fermentum, eubacterium aerofaciens and escherichia cali b. when the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). the spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of sds. the spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% triton x-100 for 2 h. these results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon sds treatment. so it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. this result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the  spirosome production by e. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of escherichia coli k88 to piglet ileal mucus by lactobacillus spp.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli k88 colonizing the piglet ileum adhere to the mucosa by k88 fimbrial appendages. a recent study in our laboratory has implicated indigenous lactobacilli in the suppression of the colonization potential of enteropathogenic e. coli as measured by adhesion to ileal mucus. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus spp. of porcine  origin on the adhesion of k88 fimbriae of e. coli. with an in vitro assay, the adhesion of e. coli k88ab strain g1108e and e. coli k88ac strain 1107 to 35-day-old piglet ileal mucus was studied in the presence of spent culture fluid  of lactobacillus spp. detailed studies focused specifically on culture fluid of lactobacillus fermentum 104r. subsequently, the ileal mucus was exposed to the retentate of the spent culture fluid after dialysis and fractionation. adhesion was confirmed to be attributable to k88 fimbriae when k88-specific monoclonal antibodies and isogenic mutants of e. coli k-12 with and without the plasmid containing the k88 gene were used. the active component was characterized by pretreatment of dialysis retentate with heat, periodate, pronase, and centrifugation, as well as by growth of the lactobacillus in various media and by assays at both 0 and 37 degrees c. all three lactobacilli of porcine origin reduced adhesion of e. coli k88 by approximately 50%. inhibition occurred when mucus was pretreated with either spent culture dialysis retentate or the void volume (fraction of > 250,000 molecular weight) after gel filtration. the activity of the dialysis retentate was sensitive to pronase, but there was still  activity at 0 degrees c.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [biological characteristics of strains of lactobacilli, promising for use as eubiotics].
AB  == in the course of in vitro studies 3 lactobacillus strains with pronounced antagonistic activity against some pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria (shigellae, enteropathogenic escherichia, proteus, staphylococci) were selected.  in experiments on germ-free rats faint colonization by l. plantarum 37 was observed in the small intestine, as well as in the large intestine when low doses of these bacilli were introduced into the gastrointestinal tract of the animals.  in vitro experiments demonstrated the decreased growth rate of this strain. the prophylactic administration of two eubiotic strains, l. plantarum 37 and l. fermentum 39, simultaneously with chloramphenicol to primates inhibited the growth of opportunistic bacteria, though l. fermentum 39 excessively suppressed the content of escherichia coli in the enterobacterial population. the optimum biological effect was achieved with the therapeutic use of these three strains for the correction of dysbiotic disturbances caused by the administration of tetracycline in volunteers.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
AB  == germfree (gf) f344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed mycobacterium bovis (bcg). specific pathogene-free (spf) rats developed less severe arthritis with a  lower incidence. the rats colonized with escherichia coli or bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in spf rats. the rats colonized with bifidobacterium, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus casei, l. fermentum, l. murini, and l. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in gf rats. furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of e. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in spf rats. these results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as e. coli and bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of spf rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as bifidobacterium, p. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and e. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
