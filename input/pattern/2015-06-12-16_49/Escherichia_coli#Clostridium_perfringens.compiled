TI  - Acute cholecystitis associated with infection of Enterobacteriaceae from gut microbiota.
AB  - Acute cholecystitis (AC) is one of the most common surgical diseases. Bacterial infection accounts for 50-85% of the disease's onset. Since there is a close relationship between the biliary system and the gut, the aims of this study were to characterize and determine the influence of gut microbiota on AC, to detect the pathogenic microorganism in the biliary system, and to explore the relationship between the gut and bile microbiota of patients with AC. A total of 185,713 high-quality sequence reads were generated from the fecal samples of 15 patients and 13 healthy controls by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Patients' samples were significantly enriched in Akkermansia, Enterobacter and Escherichia/Shigella group. The healthy controls, however, showed significant enrichment of Clostridiales, Coprococcus, Coprobacillaceae, Paraprevotella, Turicibacter and TM7-3 in their fecal samples. E. coli was the main biliary pathogenic microorganism, among others such as Klebsiella spp., Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobactercloacae in the bile of the patients. Additionally, the amount of bile endotoxin significantly correlated with the number of Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli. Our data indicate that Enterobacteriaceae might play essential role in the pathogenesis and/or progress of AC. This was verified in an in vivo model using a pathogenic E. coli isolated from one of the patients in guinea pigs and observed marked gallbladder inflammation and morphological changes. This study thus provides insight which could be very useful for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AC and related diseases by controlling the growth of Enterobacteriaceae to alleviate the infection.
TI  - High persistence of bacterial fecal indicators and Bacteroidetes genetic microbial source tracking markers in municipal wastewater during short-term storage at 5 degrees C supports automated sampling procedures.
AB  - Due to high diurnal water quality fluctuations in raw municipal wastewater, the use of proportional auto-sampling over a period of 24 h at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to evaluate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal has become a standard in many countries. Microbial removal or load estimation at municipal WWTP however is still based on manually recovered grab samples. The goal of this study was to establish basic knowledge regarding the persistence of standard bacterial fecal indicators and Bacteroidetes genetic microbial source tracking markers in municipal wastewater in order to evaluate their suitability for automated sampling, as the potential lack of persistence is the main argument against such procedures. Raw and secondary treated wastewater of municipal origin from representative and well-characterized biological WWTPs without disinfection (organic carbon and nutrient removal) was investigated in microcosm experiments at 5 degrees C and 21 degrees C with a total storage length of 32 h (including a 24 h auto-sampling component and an 8 h post-sampling phase). Vegetative Escherichia coli and enterococci as well as Clostridium perfringens spores were selected as indicators for cultivation-based standard enumeration. Molecular analysis focused on total (AllBac) and human-associated genetic Bacteroidetes (BacHum UCD, HF183 TaqMan) markers using quantitative PCR, as well as 16S-rRNA-gene based next generation sequencing (NGS). The microbial parameters showed high persistence in both raw and treated wastewater at 5 degrees C during the defined storage conditions. Surprisingly, and in contrast to results from treated wastewater, persistence of the microbial parameters in raw wastewater was also high at 21 degrees C. Based on our results, 24 h auto-sampling procedures with 5 degrees C storage conditions can be recommended when investigating fecal indicators or Bacteroidetes genetic markers at municipal WWTPs. Such auto-sampling procedures will contribute to better understanding and monitoring of municipal WWTPs as sources of fecal pollution in water resources.
TI  - Characterization, validation and application of a DNA microarray for the detection of mandatory and other waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Culture methods for the detection of indicator bacteria are currently used for detection of waterborne bacteria. The need for an increased range of analyzed bacteria coupled with the obtainment of rapid and early results justify the development of a DNA microarray for the identification of waterborne pathogens. This DNA microarray has 16 implanted probes with a median size of 147 bases, targeting 12 different parameters, including all mandatory indicator microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, total and fecal coliforms and enterococci. The validation performed with DNA extracted from pure microbial cultures showed the suitability of the probes for detection of the target microorganism. To overcome the high dilution of water samples it was included either a prior culture step of bacterial contaminants retained after filtering 100 ml of water, or a 10-fold increase in the volume of filtered water, that resulted in the increase of the detected bacteria. The analysis of complex environmental water samples using culture methods and the DNA microarray revealed that the latter detected the same parameters plus other bacteria tested only in the DNA microarray. The results show that this DNA microarray may be a useful tool for water microbiological surveillance.
TI  - Impact of Mutating the Key Residues of a Bifunctional 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase-Cyclohydrolase from Escherichia coli on Its Activities.
AB  - Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase (FolD) catalyzes interconversion of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate in the one-carbon metabolic pathway. In some organisms, the essential requirement of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate may also be fulfilled by formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (Fhs). Recently, we developed an Escherichia coli strain in which the folD gene was deleted in the presence of Clostridium perfringens fhs (E. coli DeltafolD/p-fhs) and used it to purify FolD mutants (free from the host-encoded FolD) and determine their biological activities. Mutations in the key residues of E. coli FolD, as identified from three-dimensional structures (D121A, Q98K, K54S, Y50S, and R191E), and a genetic screen (G122D and C58Y) were generated, and the mutant proteins were purified to determine their kinetic constants. Except for the R191E and K54S mutants, others were highly compromised in terms of both dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities. While the R191E mutant showed high cyclohydrolase activity, it retained only a residual dehydrogenase activity. On the other hand, the K54S mutant lacked the cyclohydrolase activity but possessed high dehydrogenase activity. The D121A and G122D (in a loop between two helices) mutants were highly compromised in terms of both dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities. In vivo and in vitro characterization of wild-type and mutant (R191E, G122D, D121A, Q98K, C58Y, K54S, and Y50S) FolD together with three-dimensional modeling has allowed us to develop a better understanding of the mechanism for substrate binding and catalysis by E. coli FolD.
TI  - Fate and transport of enteric microbes from septic systems in a coastal watershed.
AB  - Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are commonly used in coastal areas to  treat household wastewater. These systems represent potential sources of fecal pollution of groundwater and nearby surface water. OWTS are expected to reduce microbial concentrations in wastewater; however, system and environmental factors can affect treatment efficiency and impacts on ground and surface water. In the study of OWTS described in this article, the authors sampled septic tanks and groundwater at two households in coastal North Carolina between October 2009 and October 2011. Samples were tested for the fecal indicator microbes E. coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens. Microbial source tracking was also performed in year two. Results showed that enteric microbe concentrations in groundwater significantly decreased with distance from the OWTS. Human markers of fecal contamination were also detected in the OWTS and downgradient groundwater, indicating that OWTS can impact the microbial quality of shallow groundwater.
TI  - The role of biological processes in reducing both odor impact and pathogen content during mesophilic anaerobic digestion.
AB  - Mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) produces renewable energy, but it also plays a role in reducing the impact of digestates, both by reducing odor and pathogen content. Ten full-scale biogas plants characterized by different plant designs (e.g. single digesters, parallel or serial digesters), plant powers (ranging from 180 to 999kWe), hydraulic retention time (HRT) (ranging between 20 to 70days) and feed mixes were monitored and odors and pathogens were observed in both ingestates and digestates. Results obtained indicated that MAD reduced odors (OU) from, on average, OUingestate=99,106+/-149,173OUm(-2)h(-1) (n=15) to OUdigestate=1106+/-771OUm(-2)h(-1) (n=15). Pathogens were also reduced during MAD both because of ammonia production during the process and competition for substrate between pathogens and indigenous microflora, i.e. Enterobacteriaceae from 6.85 *10(3)+/-1.8 *10(1) to 1.82 *10(1)+/-3.82 *10(1); fecal Coliform from 1.82 *10(4)+/-9.09 to 2.45 *10(1)+/-3.8 *10(1); Escherichia coli from 8.72 *10(3)+/-2.4 *10(1) to 1.8 *10(1)+/-2.94 *10(1); Clostridium perfringens from 6.4 *10(4)+/-7.7 to 5.2 *10(3)+/-8.1 (all data are expressed as CFUg(-1)ww). Plants showed different abilities to reduce pathogen indicators, depending on the pH value and toxic ammonia content.
TI  - Development of intestinal microflora and occurrence of diarrhoea in sucking foals: effects of Bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almost all foals develop transient diarrhoea within the first weeks of life. Studies indicated different viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes, such as rotavirus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium are discussed. But little is known about the development of intestinal microflora in foals. The present study investigated whether the supplementation with Bacillus cereus var. toyoi would modify the developing intestinal microflora and consequently reduce diarrhoea in foals. From birth, the foals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo (10 mL isotonic NaCl, n = 8), low dosage (LD; 5 x 10(8) cfu B. cereus var. toyoi, n = 7) and high dosage (HD; 2 x 10(9) cfu B. cereus var. toyoi, n = 10). Treatment groups were supplemented orally once a day for 58 days. Faeces scoring and sampling were performed within the first 24 h after birth and on day 9, 16, 23, 30, 44, 58 of the foal's life and also on the first day of diarrhoea. Culture-plate methods were used to analyse the bacterial microflora. RESULTS: Eighty-eight per cent of the foals developed diarrhoea (placebo 7/8, LD 5/7, HD 10/10) during the first 58 days of life. Bacillus cereus var. toyoi supplementation had no effect on bacterial microflora. Clostridium perfringens and enterobacteria were equally prevalent in foals with diarrhoea and those who were not afflicted. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the supplementation of B. cereus var. toyoi had no effect on the occurrence of diarrhoea and health status in the foals.
TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis and epidural abscess caused by gas gangrene presenting with complete paraplegia: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gas gangrene is most often caused by Clostridium perfringens infection. Gas gangrene is a medical emergency that develops suddenly. The mortality rate is higher with trunk involvement than with involvement of the extremities, which carries a better prognosis. With respect to vertebral involvement, there are few reports in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to report a very rare case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by gas gangrene. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old Japanese woman with diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaints of back pain, dysuria, and complete paralysis of both legs. A computed tomography scan showed soft tissue swelling anterolaterally at intervertebral disc level T11/12 and a gas-containing epidural abscess that compressed her spinal cord. Cultures later grew Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli. Hemilaminectomy was done from T10 to T12, and an epidural abscess was removed. She went on to have fusion surgery 6 weeks after the initial operation and subsequently experienced complete pain relief. She was discharged 2 months later, at which time she was able to walk with a cane. Examination 18 months after surgery showed normal gait without a cane. CONCLUSIONS: Discitis caused by gas gangrene infection was successfully treated by immediate debridement and subsequent fusion surgery.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Bacterial enteritis in ostrich (Struthio Camelus) chicks in the Western Cape Province, South Africa.
AB  - Ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks less than 3 mo age are observed to experience a high mortality rate that is often associated with enteritis. This study was undertaken to investigate the infectious bacteria implicated in ostrich chick enteritis. Postmortems were performed on 122 ostrich chicks aged from 1 d to 3 mo and intestinal samples were subjected to bacterial culture. Bacterial isolates were typed by PCR and serotyping. Escherichia coli (E. coli; 49%) was the most frequently isolated from the samples followed by Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens; 20%), Enterococcus spp. (16%), and Salmonella spp. (7%). Of the E. coli, 39% were categorized as enteropathogenic E. coli, 4% enterotoxigenic E. coli, and no enterohaemorrhagic E. coli were found. The majority (93%) of C. perfringens was Type A and only 7% was Type E. C. perfringens Types B through D were not present. The netB gene that encodes NetB toxin was identified from 16% of the C. perfringens isolated. All the C. perfringens Type E harbored the netB gene and just 10% of the C. perfringens Type A had this gene. Three Salmonella serotypes were identified: Salmonella Muenchen (S. Muenchen; 80%), S. Hayindongo (13%), and S. Othmarschen (7%). The indication is that the cause of enteritis in ostrich chicks is bacterial-involving: enteropathogenic E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli; C. perfringens Types A and E (with the possible influence of netB gene); and S. Muenchen, S. Hayindongo, and S. Othmarschen.
TI  - Microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  - The present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). Samples were screened for Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. Microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log CFU/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (P < 0.05), whereas the other FABs contained , 25 CFU/25 ml microorganisms. Unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7 to 14.1%) or pH (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. Despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and B. cereus (detected in all FABs) were present in some products. B. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (P < 0.05). The finding that spore-forming B. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality FAB products. New strategic quality management plans for various FABs are needed.
TI  - Expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in Canada.
AB  - Enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in Canada and globally. Understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. Expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously, to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information is difficult or expensive to obtain. Thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. The elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. Experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. Estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. Transmission was attributed primarily to food for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Trichinella spp., all three Vibrio spp. categories explored, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as Campylobacter spp., four Escherichia coli categories, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. Water was the primary pathway for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and Shigella spp. Consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. This study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for Canada, considering all possible transmission routes. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and E. coli subgroups in Canada.
TI  - Focal bacterial meningitis following ascending bite wound infection leading to paraparesis in a captive California sea lion (Zalophus californianus).
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 15-yr-old captive female California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) with a 2-wk history of progressive paraparesis and a 9-mo history of exudative skin lesion on the left thoracic wall. Magnetic resonance images showed a well-defined muscle infiltrating lesion ventrolateral to the seventh cervical to the third thoracic vertebra on the left side, which extended through the left intervertebral foramina C7 to T3 into the vertebral canal, causing spinal cord compression and displacement as well as inflammation of the spinal cord and nerves. This lesion surprisingly caused no forelimb deficits. Differential diagnoses included abscess formation or neoplasia. Pathologic examination revealed chronic focal purulent meningitis associated with widespread paraspinal fistulous inflammation originating from a chronic dermal ulcer. Mainly Escherichia coli var. haemolytica and Clostridium perfringens were identified as the underlying agents.
TI  - First detection of Macrorhabdus ornithogaster in wild Eurasian Siskins (Carduelis spinus) in Germany. A case study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The colonization of the gastric ascomycetous yeast Macrorhabdus (M.) ornithogaster could be associated with a chronic wasting disease in several bird species in captivity. The prevalence and clinical relevance of M. ornithogaster in wild birds is unknown in detail. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the wintering season 2012/13 injured Eurasian Siskins (Carduelis spinus, n = 8) from the area of Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany were examined microbiologically and pathologically. RESULTS: In six out of eight injured Eurasian Siskins M. ornithogaster were detected. The yeast was diagnosed microscopically in wet smears from the gastric isthmus and/or in faecal samples. Histopathological examination (n = 4) of the macroscopically slightly enlarged proventriculus in infected birds demonstrated the growth of M. ornithogaster in the mucosal surface and in the ducts of the glands without an inflammatory reaction. As a possible sign of a lowered fitness, all six infected siskins had a reduced body weight (mean: 11.8 +/- 1.64 g) in the lower normal weight range compared to the two injured Eurasian Siskins without M. ornithogaster (15.0 g) as well as to data from the literature. Concurrent intestinal bacterial infections comprised Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella Typhimurium, that are regarded as an abnormal bacterial flora for Eurasian Siskins. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Infections with M. ornithogaster can be found in the wild population of Eurasian Siskins in Germany. The frequent occurrence of secondary bacterial infections associated with M. ornithogaster infections should be considered in the treatment and rehabilitation of finches.
TI  - Phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  - Phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. In total, 400 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. The dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (PC) or insufficient calcium (Ca) and digestible phosphor (dP)(NC) and with or without 5000 phytase units (FTU)/kg of Escherichia coli 6-phytase. The gastrointestinal tract pH values, ileal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly affected pH in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the NC resulted in a pH increase in the ileum. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. Additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. The addition of phytase increased Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp. whereas in case of Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster, Bifidobacterium sp. and Streptococcus/Lactococcus counts, a significant Ca and dP level x phytase interaction was found. However, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and Ca and dP levels were not consistent. Furthermore, the reduction of Ca and dP level lowered Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts. The analysis of fermentation products showed that reducing the Ca and dP content in the diet reduced total SCFA, DL-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the NC group. This suggests that P is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. It may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of P and Ca in a diet.
TI  - Health risk assessment related to waterborne pathogens from the river to the tap.
AB  - A two-year monitoring program of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, Giardia duodenalis cysts, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores and adenovirus was conducted in three large rivers in France used for recreational activities and as a resource for drinking water production. Fifty-liter river water and one thousand-liter tap water samples were concentrated using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration and analyzed by molecular biology or laser-scanning cytometry. In order to evaluate watershed land use influence on microorganism concentration changes, occurrence and seasonality of microorganisms were studied. The highest concentrations of protozoan parasites and C. perfringens were found for one of the three sites, showing a high proportion of agricultural territories, forests and semi-natural environments, which may be partly attributable to soil leaching due to rainfall events. On the contrary, the highest concentrations of adenoviruses were found at the two other sites, probably due to strong urban activities. Health risk assessment was evaluated for each waterborne pathogen regarding exposure during recreational activities (for a single or five bathing events during the summer). The calculated risk was lower than 0.5% for parasites and varied from 1% to 42% for adenovirus. A theoretical assessment of microorganism removal during the drinking water treatment process was also performed, and it showed that an absence of microorganisms could be expected in finished drinking water. This hypothesis was confirmed since all tested tap water samples were negative for each studied microorganism, resulting in a risk for drinking water consumption lower than 0.01% for parasites and lower than 0.5% for adenovirus.
TI  - Characteristics of Metroxylon sagu resistant starch type III as prebiotic substance.
AB  - Resistant starch type III (RS3 ) was produced from sago (Metroxylon sagu) and evaluated for its characteristics as a prebiotic. Two RS3 samples designated sago RS and HCl-sago RS contained 35.71% and 68.30% RS, respectively, were subjected to hydrolyses by gastric juice and digestive enzymes and to absorption. Both sago RS and HCl-sago RS were resistant to 180 min hydrolysis by gastric acidity at pH 1 to 4 with less than 0.85% hydrolyzed. Both samples were also resistant toward hydrolysis by gastrointestinal tract enzymes and intestinal absorption with 96.75% and 98.69% of RS3 were recovered respectively after 3.5 h digestion and overnight dialysis at 37 degrees C. Sago RS3 supported the growth of both beneficial (lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and pathogenic microbes (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter coli, and Clostridium perfringens) in the range of 2.60 to 3.91 log10 CFU/mL. Hence, prebiotic activity score was applied to describe the extent to which sago RS3 supports selective growth of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains over pathogenic bacteria. The highest scores were obtained from Bifidobacterium sp. FTDC8943 grown on sago RS (+0.26) and HCl-sago RS (+0.24) followed by L. bulgaricus FTDC1511 grown on sago RS (+0.21). The findings had suggested that sago RS3 has the prebiotic partial characteristics and it is suggested to further assess the suitability of sago RS3 as a prebiotic material.
TI  - Microbial pathogens in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Hamburg.
AB  - Microbial pathogens are among the major health problems associated with water and wastewater. Classical indicators of fecal contamination include total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens. These fecal indicators were monitored in order to obtain information regarding their evolution during wastewater treatment processes. Helminth eggs survive for a long duration in the environment and have a high potential for waterborne transmission, making them reliable contaminant indicators. A large quantity of helminth eggs was detected in the wastewater samples using the Bailanger method. Eggs were found in the influent and effluent with average concentration ranging from 11 to 50 eggs/L. Both E. coli and total coliforms concentrations were significantly 1- to 3-fold higher in influent than in effluent. The average concentrations of E. coli ranged from 2.5x10(3) to 4.4x10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/100 ml. Concentrations of total coliforms ranged from 3.6x10(3) to 7.9x10(5) CFU/100 ml. Clostridium perfringens was also detected in influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) at average concentrations ranging from 5.4x10(2) to 9.1x10(2) most probable number (MPN)/100 ml. Significant Spearman rank correlations were found between helminth eggs and microbial indicators (total coliform, E. coli, and C. perfringens) in the WWTP. There is therefore need for additional microbial pathogen monitoring in the WWTP to minimize public health risk.
TI  - An assessment of the human health impact of seven leading foodborne pathogens in  the United States using disability adjusted life years.
AB  - SUMMARY We explored the overall impact of foodborne disease caused by seven leading foodborne pathogens in the United States using the disability adjusted life year (DALY). We defined health states for each pathogen (acute illness and sequelae) and estimated the average annual incidence of each health state using data from public health surveillance and previously published estimates from studies in the United States, Canada and Europe. These pathogens caused about 112 000 DALYs annually due to foodborne illnesses acquired in the United States. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (32 900) and Toxoplasma (32 700) caused the most DALYs, followed by Campylobacter (22 500), norovirus (9900), Listeria monocytogenes (8800), Clostridium perfringens (4000), and Escherichia coli O157 (1200). These estimates can be used to prioritize food safety interventions. Future estimates of the burden of foodborne disease in DALYs would be improved by addressing important data gaps and by the development and validation of US-specific disability weights for foodborne diseases.
TI  - Modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - At high altitude (HA) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (GI) disorder are very common phenomena. To explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the GI functions, were subjected following simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. For this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. It was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and Escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The population density of strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (GDI). In relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of IgA and IgG increased in duration dependent manner. The activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. Besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered GSH/GSSG pool in the intestinal epithelia. Histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. It can be concluded that hypoxia at HA modified GI microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small intestinal dysfunction at HA.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in Olsztyn, Poland. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC22, HPC37), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. Their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6), 3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)CFU/g, respectively. It was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater than those obtained by the cultivation method. Among identified Enterobacteriaceae, Pantoea spp. and Enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas Escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when E. coli were absent. Bacteria from Staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. Additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. Maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)CFU/g. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Trichoderma genera were most numerous among molds, whereas Trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. Sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. Potentially pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when Toxocara and E. coli were absent. It seems that assessing the contamination of children's play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes and may not fully reflect their safety for children.
TI  - Novel receptors for bacterial protein toxins.
AB  - While bacterial effectors are often directly introduced into eukaryotic target cells by various types of injection machines, toxins enter the cytosol of host cells from endosomal compartments or after retrograde transport via Golgi from the ER. A first crucial step of toxin-host interaction is receptor binding. Using optimized protocols and new methods novel toxin receptors have been identified, including metalloprotease ADAM 10 for Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, laminin receptor Lu/BCAM for Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1, lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) for Clostridium difficile transferase CDT and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 1 for Clostridium perfringens TpeL toxin.
TI  - Prevalence of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and dysbiosis in fecal samples of dogs with diarrhea.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens has been suspected as an enteropathogen in dogs. However, its exact role in gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in dogs remains unknown. Recent studies suggest the importance of an altered intestinal microbiota in the activation of virulence factors of enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between diarrhea, dysbiosis, and the presence of C. perfringens and its enterotoxin (CPE). Fecal samples were collected prospectively from 95 healthy control dogs and 104 dogs with GI disease and assessed for bacterial abundances and the presence of CPE using quantitative PCR and ELISA, respectively. C. perfringens was detected in all dogs. Potentially enterotoxigenic C. perfringens were detected in 33.7% (32/95) of healthy control dogs and 48.1% (50/104) diseased dogs, respectively. CPE was detected by ELISA in 1.0% (1/95) of control dogs and 16.3% (17/104) of diseased dogs. Abundances of Fusobacteria, Ruminococcaceae, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium were significantly decreased in diseased dogs, while abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Escherichia coli were significantly increased compared to control dogs. The microbial dysbiosis was independent of the presence of the enterotoxigenic C. perfringens or CPE. In conclusion, the presence of CPE as well as fecal dysbiosis was associated with GI disease. However, the presence of C. perfringens was not indicative of GI disease in all cases of diarrhea, and the observed increased abundance of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens may be part of intestinal dysbiosis occurring in GI disease. The significance of an intestinal dysbiosis in dogs with GI disease deserves further attention.
TI  - One-carbon metabolic pathway rewiring in Escherichia coli reveals an evolutionary advantage of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (Fhs) in survival under hypoxia.
AB  - In cells, N(10)-formyltetrahydrofolate (N(10)-fTHF) is required for formylation of eubacterial/organellar initiator tRNA and purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Biosynthesis of N(10)-fTHF is catalyzed by 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (FolD) and/or 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (Fhs). All eubacteria possess FolD, but some possess both FolD and Fhs. However, the reasons for possessing Fhs in addition to FolD have remained unclear. We used Escherichia coli, which naturally lacks fhs, as our model. We show that in E. coli, the essential function of folD could be replaced by Clostridium perfringens fhs when it was provided on a medium-copy-number plasmid or integrated as a single-copy gene in the chromosome. The fhs-supported folD deletion (DeltafolD) strains grow well in a complex medium. However, these strains require purines and glycine as supplements for growth in M9 minimal medium. The in vivo levels of N(10)-fTHF in the DeltafolD strain (supported by plasmid-borne fhs) were limiting despite the high capacity of the available Fhs to synthesize N(10)-fTHF in vitro. Auxotrophy for purines could be alleviated by supplementing formate to the medium, and that for glycine was alleviated by engineering THF import into the cells. The DeltafolD strain (harboring fhs on the chromosome) showed a high NADP(+)-to-NADPH ratio and hypersensitivity to trimethoprim. The presence of fhs in E. coli was disadvantageous for its aerobic growth. However, under hypoxia, E. coli strains harboring fhs outcompeted those lacking it. The computational analysis revealed a predominant natural occurrence of fhs in anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - At high altitude (HA) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (GI) disorder are very common phenomena. To explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the GI functions, were subjected following simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. For this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. It was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and Escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The population density of strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (GDI). In relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of IgA and IgG increased in duration dependent manner. The activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. Besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered GSH/GSSG pool in the intestinal epithelia. Histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. It can be concluded that hypoxia at HA modified GI microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small intestinal dysfunction at HA.
TI  - [Focal meningitis in a California sea lion (Zalophus californianus)--diagnostic procedure and pathology].
AB  - A 15-year-old female California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) with progressive lameness of the hindlimbs and a chronic skin lesion was presented for clinical examination. The clinical neurological examination, showing a paraparesis, was completed by magnetic resonance imaging. MR images of the cervical and thoracic spine showed a well-defined muscle infiltrating lesion between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and the second thoracic vertebra (T2), which extended through the intervertebral foramina between C7 and T1 into the vertebral canal, causing spinal cord compression and displacement. Pathological examination revealed focal purulent meningitis resulting from widespread fistulas of the chronic skin leasion, which was infected with Escherichia coli var. haemolytica and Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria grow within Candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  - The human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. A major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. We examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, Candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. We observed that biofilms formed by C. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. We also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in C. albicans, including upregulation of WOR1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in C. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. Finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, C. perfringens induces aggregation of C. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow C. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. This work indicates that bacteria and C. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from Australian dairy farm environments.
AB  - The ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. In dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. This survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3 caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in Victoria, Australia. A total of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. The prevalence of the Bacillus cereus group, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cronobacter, Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and Yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. The 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the B. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by Cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. The highest occurrence of any pathogen was the B. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. Fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. Salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. Out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. All of the CPS were Staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. Pathogenic Listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 L. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 L. monocytogenes-positive water sample. Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a single raw milk sample. Cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms, predominantly in feed samples. No Y. enterocolitica was detected. Results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. Monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as Cl. perfringens and B. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.
TI  - Surveillance for zoonotic and selected pathogens in harbor seals Phoca vitulina from central California.
AB  - The infection status of harbor seals Phoca vitulina in central California, USA, was evaluated through broad surveillance for pathogens in stranded and wild-caught animals from 2001 to 2008, with most samples collected in 2007 and 2008. Stranded animals from Mendocino County to San Luis Obispo County were sampled at a rehabilitation facility: The Marine Mammal Center (TMMC, n = 175); wild-caught animals were sampled at 2 locations: San Francisco Bay (SF, n = 78) and Tomales Bay (TB, n = 97), that differed in degree of urbanization. Low prevalences of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium were detected in the feces of stranded and wild-caught seals. Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli were more prevalent in the feces of stranded (58% [78 out of 135] and 76% [102 out of 135]) than wild-caught (42% [45 out of 106] and 66% [68 out of 106]) seals, whereas Vibrio spp. were 16 times more likely to be cultured from the feces of seals from SF than TB or TMMC (p < 0.005). Brucella DNA was detected in 3.4% of dead stranded harbor seals (2 out of 58). Type A influenza was isolated from feces of 1 out of 96 wild-caught seals. Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis neurona, and type A influenza was only detected in the wild-caught harbor seals (post-weaning age classes), whereas antibody titers to Leptospira spp. were detected in stranded and wild-caught seals. No stranded (n = 109) or wild-caught (n = 217) harbor seals had antibodies to phocine distemper virus, although a single low titer to canine distemper virus was detected. These results highlight the role of harbor seals as sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment.
TI  - Effect of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 spores as a probiotic feed supplement on growth performance, noxious gas emission, and intestinal microflora in broilers.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis C-3102 has been used as a direct-fed microbial or probiotic product since 1986 to improve production performance in broilers worldwide. This study was conducted to determine and confirm the effect of B. subtilis C-3102 spore supplementation to feed on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass quality, blood profiles, noxious gas emission, and intestinal and excreta microflora in broilers. A total of 816 one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers (46.06 +/- 0.67 g) were used in a 5-wk study with Calsporin, B. subtilis final product (1.0 x 10(9) cfu/g of B. subtilis). Broilers were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments consisting of 16 replicate cages with 17 broilers each: I) CON (control, basal diet), II) BS300 (CON + 300 mg of B. subtilis/kg of feed), and III) BS600 (CON + 600 mg of B. subtilis/kg of feed). Regarding probiotic effect, B. subtilis significantly increased Lactobacillus counts in the cecum, ileal, and excreta, and reduced Escherichia coli counts in the cecum and excreta, compared with CON. In addition, supplementation also tended to reduce Clostridium perfringens counts in the large intestine and excreta, while linearly reducing Salmonella counts in the cecum, ileal, large intestine, and excreta, compared with CON. Regarding growth performance, B. subtilis enhanced ADG in the starter and overall experimental periods, without any effects on feed intake compared with CON. Consequently, feed conversion ratio in the grower-finisher and overall experimental periods decreased significantly. The inclusion of B. subtilis improved the digestibility of DM and gross energy, as well as reducing ammonia emission, compared with CON. No significant difference in breast muscle color, water holding capacity, and drip loss, and relative organ weights, as well as in white blood cells, red blood cells, lymphocyte counts, and IgG amount, were observed. Overall, B. subtilis C-1302 is capable of providing a probiotic effect leading to improved growth performance and feed efficiency, due to the manipulation of intestinal microflora, with minimal side effects in broilers.
TI  - Influence of wastewater disinfection on densities of culturable fecal indicator bacteria and genetic markers.
AB  - The US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as a rapid alternative analytical method for monitoring recreational water quality at beaches. For qPCR to be considered for other Clean Water Act purposes, such as inclusion in discharge permits and use in Total Maximum Daily Load calculations, it is necessary to understand how qPCR detectable genetic markers are influenced by wastewater disinfection. This study investigated genetic markers for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Clostridium spp., Bacteroides, total Bacteroidales, as well as the human-associated Bacteroides markers, HF183 and HumM2, to determine which, if any, were influenced by disinfection (chlorination or ultraviolet light) of effluents from secondary wastewater treatment in different seasons. The effects of disinfection on culturable enterococci, E. coli, Bacteroides, and C. perfringens were also compared to their associated genetic markers. Disinfection of secondary treatment effluents significantly reduced culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) but not genetic marker densities. No significant differences were observed in the responses of FIB culture and genetic marker densities to type of disinfection (chlorination vs UV) or season. Results of this study provide evidence that qPCR may not be suitable for monitoring efficacy of wastewater disinfection on the inactivation of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Massive hemolysis and erythrophagocytosis in severe sepsis.
AB  
TI  - Hygienization performances of innovative sludge treatment solutions to assure safe land spreading.
AB  - The present research aims at the evaluation of the hygienization performances of  innovative sludge treatment processes applied for the separated treatment of secondary sludge. Namely, two digestion pretreatments (sonication and thermal hydrolysis) and two sequential biological processes (mesophilic/thermophilic and anaerobic/aerobic digestion) were compared to the mesophilic (MAD) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD). Microbial indicators (Escherichia coli, somatic coliphages and Clostridium perfringens spores) and pathogens (Salmonella and enteroviruses), which show different resistances to treatment processes, were monitored in untreated and treated sludge. Overall, microbial load in secondary sludge was shown to be similar or lower than previously reported in literature for mixed sludge. Notably, the anaerobic/aerobic digestion process increased the removal of E. coli and somatic coliphages compared to the simple MAD and always achieved the hygienization requirement (2-log-unit removal of E. coli) proposed by EU Commission in the 3rd Working Document on sludge (April 2000) for the use of treated sludges in agriculture with restriction on their application. The microbial quality limits for the unrestricted use of sludge in agriculture (no Salmonella in 50 g wet weight (WW) and E. coli <500 CFU/g) were always met when thermal digestion or pretreatment was applied; however, the required removal level (6-log-unit removal of E. coli) could not be assessed due to the low level of this microorganism in raw sludge. Observed levels of indicator removal showed a higher resistance of viral particles to thermal treatment compared with bacterial cells and confirmed the suitability of somatic coliphages as indicators in thermal treatment processes.
TI  - Induction of potential protective immunity against enterotoxemia in calves by single or multiple recombinant Clostridium perfringens toxoids.
AB  - Cattle enterotoxemia caused by Clostridium perfringens toxins is a noncontagious, sporadic, and fatal disease characterized by sudden death. Strategies for controlling and preventing cattle enterotoxemia are based on systematic vaccination of herds with toxoids. Because the process of producing conventional clostridial vaccines is dangerous, expensive, and time-consuming, the prospect of recombinant toxoid vaccines against diseases caused by C. perfringens toxins is promising. In this study, nontoxic recombinant toxoids derived from alpha-, beta- and epsilon-toxins of C. perfringens, namely, rCPA247-370 , rCPB and rEtxHP, respectively, were expressed in Escherichia coli. High levels of specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against the toxins were detected in sera from calves vaccinated with either a single recombinant toxoid or a mixed cocktail of all three recombinant toxoids, indicating the potential of these recombinant toxoids to provide calves with protective immunity against enterotoxemia caused by C. perfringens.
TI  - Investigation on antibacterial and antioxidant activities, phenolic and flavonoid contents of some thai edible plants as an alternative for antibiotics.
AB  - This study was aimed to examine the antibacterial and antioxidative properties of seven edible plants from Thailand to develop alternative antibiotics as feed additives. The plants include Citrus aurantifolia Swingle (Lime) fruits and its leaves, Sesbania grandiflora L. (Agati sesbania) leaves, Piper sarmentosum Roxb (Wild betal) leaves, Curcuma domestica Valeton (Turmeric) roots, Morinda citrifolia L. (Beach mulberry) leaves, Cassia siamea britt (Siamea cassia) leaves, and Cocos nucifera L. (Coconut) peels. The plants were extracted by methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. Antibacterial activities with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined by agar diffusion assay against Escherichia coli, Burkholderia sp., Haemopilus somnus, Haemopilus parasuis, and Clostridium perfringens that were considered pathogenic strains in livestock infection. Methanol extracts of C. aurantifolia Swingle fruits and leaves showed the broadest spectrum of antibacterial activities except for C. perfringens. Butanol extract of S. grandiflora L. leaves showed the strongest activity against Burkholderia sp. with MIC, 135 mug/mL. P. sarmentosum Roxb leaves showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, Burkholderia sp. and H. parasuis. Ethyl acetate and water extracts from C. domesitca Valeton roots showed MIC of 306 mug/mL and 183 mug/mL, respectively against only C. perfringens. Antioxidative activity was determined by 2-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl photometric assay. The methanol extracts of C. aurantifolia Swingle fruits and P. sarmentosum Roxb leaves showed the highest antioxidant activity among all the extracts with 3.46 mg/mL and 2.70 mg/mL effective concentration 50% (EC50) values, respectively. Total contents of phenolics and flavonoids were measured from the plant extracts. Methanol extracts of S. grandiflora L. and chloroform extracts of C. domestica Valeton were found to have the highest amount of total phenolics, 41.7 and 47.8 mug/mL, respectively. Flavonoid content of methanol extracts in S. grandiflora L. T was 22.5 mug/mL and the highest among plant extracts tested. These results indicated that C. aurantifolia Swingle, S. grandiflora L., P. sarmentosum Roxb, and C. domestica Valeton have antibacterial and antioxidant activities and can be used as alternative antibiotics or potential feed additives for the control of animal pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Photocatalytic and biocidal activities of novel coating systems of mesoporous and dense TiO(2)-anatase containing silver nanoparticles.
AB  - Here we describe the development of novel nanostructured coating systems with improved photocatalytic and antibacterial activities. These systems comprise a layer of SiO2 followed by a layer of mesoporous or dense TiO2-anatase, and doping with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). The coatings were synthesized via a sol-gel technique by combining colloidal Ag NPs with TiO2 and SiO2 sols. The photocatalytic activity was studied through methyl orange decomposition under UV light. Results showed a great increase of photocatalytic activity by Ag NPs doping. The most active photocatalyst corresponded to the Ag-SiO2/TiO2 mesoporous system, associated with the porosity of the coatings and with the decrease of e-h recombination for the presence of Ag NPs. All the TiO2 coatings showed a strong bactericidal activity against planktonic forms of Gram-negative (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes) pathogens, as well as a strong germicidal effect against deadly spores of human gas gangrene- and anthrax-producing bacteria (Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus anthracis, respectively). The bactericidal and sporocidal activity was improved by doping the coatings with Ag NPs, even more when nanoparticles were in the outer layer of TiO2, because they are more accessible to the environment. The mechanisms responsible for the increase of photocatalytic and bactericidal behaviors related to Ag NP doping were studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry, UV-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence and anodic stripping voltammetry. It was found that the separation of the electron-hole pair contributed to the enhancement of photocatalysis, whereas the effect of the local electric field reinforcement was probably present. A possible involvement of a decrease of band-gap energy and dispersion by silver nanoparticles is ruled out. bactericidal efficacy was increased by Ag(+) ion release. Overall, the results included in this article show that the architecture of the films may tune photocatalytic and bactericidal properties.
TI  - Crucial role of perfringolysin O D1 domain in orchestrating structural transitions leading to membrane-perforating pores: a hydrogen-deuterium exchange study.
AB  - Perfringolysin O (PFO) is a toxic protein that binds to cholesterol-containing membranes, oligomerizes, and forms a beta-barrel transmembrane pore, leading to cell lysis. Previous studies have uncovered the sequence of events in this multistage structural transition to a considerable detail, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. By measuring hydrogen-deuterium exchange patterns of peptide bond amide protons monitored by mass spectrometry (MS), we have mapped structural changes in PFO and its variant bearing a point mutation during incorporation to the lipid environment. We have defined all regions that undergo structural changes caused by the interaction with the lipid environment both in wild-type PFO, thus providing new experimental constraints for molecular modeling of the pore formation process, and in a point mutant, W165T, for which the pore formation process is known to be inefficient. We have demonstrated that point mutation W165T causes destabilization of protein solution structure, strongest for domain D1, which interrupts the pathway of structural transitions in other domains necessary for proper oligomerization in the membrane. In PFO, the strongest changes accompanying binding to the membrane focus in D1; the C-terminal part of D4; and strands beta1, beta4, and beta5 of D3. These changes were much weaker for PFO(W165T) lipo where substantial stabilization was observed only in D4 domain. In this study, the application of hydrogen-deuterium exchange analysis monitored by MS provided new insight into conformational changes of PFO associated with the membrane binding, oligomerization, and lytic pore formation.
TI  - Iron fortification adversely affects the gut microbiome, increases pathogen abundance and induces intestinal inflammation in Kenyan infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In-home iron fortification for infants in developing countries is recommended for control of anaemia, but low absorption typically results in >80% of the iron passing into the colon. Iron is essential for growth and virulence of many pathogenic enterobacteria. We determined the effect of high and low dose in-home iron fortification on the infant gut microbiome and intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We performed two double-blind randomised controlled trials in 6-month-old Kenyan infants (n=115) consuming home-fortified maize porridge daily for 4 months. In the first, infants received a micronutrient powder (MNP) containing 2.5 mg iron as NaFeEDTA or the MNP without iron. In the second, they received a different MNP containing 12.5 mg iron as ferrous fumarate or the MNP without the iron. The primary outcome was gut microbiome composition analysed by 16S pyrosequencing and targeted real-time PCR (qPCR). Secondary outcomes included faecal calprotectin (marker of intestinal inflammation) and incidence of diarrhoea. We analysed the trials separately and combined. RESULTS: At baseline, 63% of the total microbial 16S rRNA could be assigned to Bifidobacteriaceae but there were high prevalences of pathogens, including Salmonella Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and pathogenic Escherichia coli. Using pyrosequencing, +FeMNPs increased enterobacteria, particularly Escherichia/Shigella (p=0.048), the enterobacteria/bifidobacteria ratio (p=0.020), and Clostridium (p=0.030). Most of these effects were confirmed using qPCR; for example, +FeMNPs increased pathogenic E. coli strains (p=0.029). +FeMNPs also increased faecal calprotectin (p=0.002). During the trial, 27.3% of infants in +12.5 mgFeMNP required treatment for diarrhoea versus 8.3% in -12.5 mgFeMNP (p=0.092). There were no study-related serious adverse events in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, provision of iron-containing MNPs to weaning infants adversely affects the gut microbiome, increasing pathogen abundance and causing intestinal inflammation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01111864.
TI  - Screening of Lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. A study was conducted to evaluate probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or cloacae of domestic geese. Among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S-23S regions of rDNA, dominated Lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and Lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). All lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and Riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. In the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to Lactobacillus was observed in R. anatipestifer and P. multocida, and the lowest in E. coli and S. aureus. The ability to produce H(2)O(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus sp. All lactobacilli showed resistance to pH 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. The selected Lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and were also resistant to low pH and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Proportion of illness acquired by foodborne transmission for nine enteric pathogens in Australia: an expert elicitation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimates of the burden of illness acquired from food inform public health policy and prioritize interventions. A key component of such estimates is the proportion of illnesses that are acquired by foodborne transmission. In view of the shortage of requisite data, these proportions are commonly obtained through a process known as expert elicitation. We report findings from an elicitation process used to assess the importance of the foodborne transmission route for nine pathogens in Australia, circa 2010. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven experts were asked to estimate the proportion of illness acquired by five transmission routes: food, environmental, water, person, and zoonotic, together with a 90% certainty interval for foodborne transmission. Foodborne estimates and intervals from each expert were combined using both modified triangular and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distributions, in @Risk version 6, to generate final distributions from which median estimates and 95% Credible Intervals (CrI) were calculated. RESULTS: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) was the only pathogen believed to have an important zoonotic transmission route, while norovirus, hepatitis A virus, non-STEC pathogenic E. coli, and Shigella spp. were all thought to be primarily spread from person to person. Foodborne transmission was the main route for Clostridium perfringens (98%, CrI: 84-100), Listeria monocytogenes (98%, CrI: 86-100), nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (72%, CrI: 50-87), and Campylobacter spp. (77%, CrI: 60-90). Foodborne estimates using the modified triangular distribution had wider CrI than these calculated using the PERT distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Foodborne proportions for most pathogens in this study were the same or lower than those estimated circa 2000 in Australia, with the greatest decline for non-STEC pathogenic E. coli. Inclusion of certainty intervals from experts helps to quantify the precision of foodborne proportions. A decline in estimates of the foodborne proportion for common pathogens will influence final estimates of the burden of illness acquired from food.
TI  - First isolation of Mycoplasma iowae in grey partridge flocks.
AB  - Mycoplasma iowae, an occasional pathogen of turkeys, was isolated for the first time from captive grey partridges (Perdix perdix). Clinical signs including respiratory and intestinal disorder were seen in birds of all ages but mainly in those kept housed during rearing. Mortality rates averaged over 20% during the year. Treatment with antibiotics and antiparasitic drugs produced only a transient improvement in condition. The gross pathology findings included poor body growth, lack of development of the breast muscles, abnormalities in the keel development, and bone fragility. Some birds showed infraorbital sinusitis with serous or fibrinous exudates and catarrhal tracheitis, while others presented serofibrinous airsacculitis and splenomegaly. Laboratory investigations revealed pure cultures of M. iowae in the gut as well as sinus and air sacs. While other organisms such as coccidia, Trichomonas, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Aspergillus spp. were detected, the similarity of the disease with that seen in turkeys infected with M. iowae strongly suggests that this mycoplasma may be the primary pathogen here. The presence of M. iowae in game birds commonly released into the wild could have serious implications particularly in areas where industrial poultry farms are concentrated.
TI  - The effect of experimental fusarium mycotoxicosis on microbiota diversity in porcine ascending colon contents.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the effect of exposure of pigs to the Fusarium mycotoxins zearalenone (ZEN) and deoxynivalenol (DON), administered together and separately, on the colon microbiota. An experiment was conducted for 42 days on gilts, randomly assigned to four groups and administered either ZEN, DON, ZEN+DON, or a placebo. The number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeasts, molds, anaerobic Clostridium perfringens, fecal streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined in the contents of the ascending colon. The influence of mycotoxins on the functional diversity of the colonic microbiota was assessed using EcoPlate tests (Biolog). Analysis revealed the predominance of LAB in all groups of pigs. Zearalenone, administered separately and together with DON, was found to have an adverse effect on mesophilic aerobic bacteria, but only after long exposure to this mycotoxin. During the six weeks of the experiment, the concentration of C. perfringens, E. coli, and other bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae was most considerably reduced in the experimental groups exposed to zearalenone, both separately and together with DON. Mycotoxins also affected the functional biodiversity of microorganisms. Both Shannon's diversity index and the number of catabolized substrates in Biolog plate (the R index) were much higher in the group subjected to mixed mycotoxicosis.
TI  - Applicability of universal Bacteroidales genetic marker for microbial monitoring  of drinking water sources in comparison to conventional indicators.
AB  - Water quality monitoring is essential for the provision of safe drinking water. In this study, we compared a selection of fecal indicators with universal Bacteroidales genetic marker to identify fecal pollution of a variety of drinking water sources. A total of 60 samples were collected from water sources. The microbiological parameters included total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci as the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), Clostridium perfringens and H2S bacteria as alternative indicators, universal Bacteroidales genetic marker as a promising alternative fecal indicator, and Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and E. coli O157 as pathogenic bacteria. From 60 samples analyzed, Bacteroidales was the most frequently detected indicator followed by total coliforms. However, the Bacteroidales assay failed to detect the marker in nine samples positive for FIB and other alternative indicators. The results of our study showed that the absence of Bacteroidales is not necessarily an evidence of fecal and pathogenic bacteria absence and may be unable to ensure the safety of the water. Further research, however, is required for a better understanding of the use of a Bacteroidales genetic marker as an indicator in water quality monitoring programs.
TI  - Structure of a C. perfringens enterotoxin mutant in complex with a modified Claudin-2 extracellular loop 2.
AB  - CPE (Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin) is the major virulence determinant for  C. perfringens type-A food poisoning, the second most common bacterial food-borne illness in the UK and USA. After binding to its receptors, which include particular human claudins, the toxin forms pores in the cell membrane. The mature pore apparently contains a hexamer of CPE, claudin and, possibly, occludin. The combination of high binding specificity with cytotoxicity has resulted in CPE being investigated, with some success, as a targeted cytotoxic agent for oncotherapy. In this paper, we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of CPE in complex with a peptide derived from extracellular loop 2 of a modified, CPE-binding Claudin-2, together with high-resolution native and pore-formation mutant structures. Our structure provides the first atomic-resolution data on any part of a claudin molecule and reveals that claudin's CPE-binding fingerprint (NPLVP) is in a tight turn conformation and binds, as expected, in CPE's C-terminal claudin-binding groove. The leucine and valine residues insert into the binding groove while the first residue, asparagine, tethers the peptide via an interaction with CPE's aspartate 225 and the two prolines are required to maintain the tight turn conformation. Understanding the structural basis of the contribution these residues make to binding will aid in engineering CPE to target tumor cells.
TI  - B-cell epitope of beta toxin of Clostridium perfringens genetically conjugated to a carrier protein: expression, purification and characterization of the chimeric protein.
AB  - Beta toxin (btx) is the prime virulence factor for the pathogenesis of Clostridium perfringens type C strain, known to cause necrotic enteritis and enterotoxaemia in mammalian species. The existing vaccines targeting btx are formaldehyde inactivated culture filtrates of Clostridium. These filtrates raise antigenic load in the host leading to nonspecific and poor responses. The present study aimed to overcome these drawbacks and generate a chimeric protein carrying in silico identified B-cell epitope of btx fused with a carrier protein as a vaccine candidate. Using bioinformatic tools, three stretches of amino acids were predicted as putative B-cell epitopes. One of the epitopes spanning 140-156 amino acid residues was genetically conjugated with B-subunit of heat labile enterotoxin (LTB) of Escherichia coli and expressed as a translational fusion in Vibrio cholerae secretory expression system. High level expression of the recombinant fusion protein rLTB-Btx140-156 was obtained and the protein was successfully purified. The recombinant protein retained the native LTB property to pentamerize and bind to GM1 ganglioside receptor of LTB. The antigenicity of both the epitope and the carrier protein was maintained in fusion protein as indicated by immunoblotting against anti-LTB and anti-btx antibody. The rLTB-Btx140-156 fusion protein therefore can be evaluated as a potential vaccine candidate against C. perfringens.
TI  - Survival of Salmonella spp. and fecal indicator bacteria in Vietnamese biogas digesters receiving pig slurry.
AB  - Small-scale biogas digesters are widely promoted worldwide as a sustainable technology to manage livestock manure. In Vietnam, pig slurry is commonly applied to biogas digesters for production of gas for electricity and cooking with the effluent being used to fertilize field crops, vegetables and fish ponds. Slurry may contain a variety of zoonotic pathogens, e.g. Salmonella spp., which are able to cause disease in humans either through direct contact with slurry or by fecal contamination of water and foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of Salmonella spp. and the fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci, E. coli, and spores of Clostridium perfringens in biogas digesters operated by small-scale Vietnamese pig farmers. The serovar and antimicrobial susceptibility of the Salmonella spp. isolated were also established. The study was conducted in 12 farms (6 farms with and 6 farms without toilet connected) located in Hanam province, Vietnam. Sampling of pig slurry and biogas effluent was done during two seasons. Results showed that the concentration of enterococci, E. coli, and Clostridium perfringens spores was overall reduced by only 1-2 log10-units in the biogas digesters when comparing raw slurry and biogas effluent. Salmonella spp. was found in both raw slurry and biogas effluent. A total of 19 Salmonella serovars were identified, with the main serovars being Salmonella Typhimurium (55/138), Salmonella enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- (19/138), Salmonella Weltevreden (9/138) and Salmonella Rissen (9/138). The Salmonella serovars showed similar antimicrobial resistance patterns to those previously reported from Vietnam. When promoting biogas, farmers should be made aware that effluent should only be used as fertilizer for crops not consumed raw and that indiscriminate discharge of effluent are likely to contaminate water recipients, e.g. drinking water sources, with pathogens. Relevant authorities should promote safe animal manure management practices to farmers and regulations be updated to ensure food safety and public health.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of the efficacy of soapy water to clean hands: a randomized, non-inferiority field trial.
AB  - We conducted a randomized, non-inferiority field trial in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh among mothers to compare microbial efficacy of soapy water (30 g powdered detergent in 1.5 L water) with bar soap and water alone. Fieldworkers collected hand rinse samples before and after the following washing regimens: scrubbing with soapy water for 15 and 30 seconds; scrubbing with bar soap for 15 and 30 seconds; and scrubbing with water alone for 15 seconds. Soapy water and bar soap removed thermotolerant coliforms similarly after washing for 15 seconds (mean log10 reduction = 0.7 colony-forming units [CFU], P < 0.001 for soapy water; mean log10 reduction = 0.6 CFU, P = 0.001 for bar soap). Increasing scrubbing time to 30 seconds did not improve removal (P > 0.05). Scrubbing hands with water alone also reduced thermotolerant coliforms (mean log10 reduction = 0.3 CFU, P = 0.046) but was less efficacious than scrubbing hands with soapy water. Soapy water is an inexpensive and microbiologically effective cleansing agent to improve handwashing among households with vulnerable children.
TI  - Porcine group A rotaviruses with heterogeneous VP7 and VP4 genotype combinations  can be found together with enteric bacteria on Belgian swine farms.
AB  - Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are an important cause of diarrhea in young piglets, resulting in significant economic losses. However, the role of RVA in the etiology of piglet diarrhea on Belgian swine farms was previously unreported. In the present study, different techniques, including fast antigen detection tests, virus isolation, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR have been applied for detection of RVA in diarrheic (n=28) and asymptomatic (n=6) fecal samples collected on Belgian pig farms. RT-qPCR was shown to be most sensitive. Routine bacteriological analysis of the fecal samples showed that most diarrheic RVA positive samples were also co-infected with one or more bacterial species, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella sp. and/or Brachyspira sp. Further genetic characterization of the VP7 and VP4 genes of 26 RVA strains resulted in the detection of six different G-genotypes (G2, G3, G4, G5, G9 and G11), and five different P-genotypes (P[6], P[7], P[13], P[23], P[27]), in a total of 12 different G/P combinations. A large intra-genotypic diversity was also apparent. In conclusion, results of the present study help us better understand the role of RVA in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea, and provide better insights into the vast genetic diversity present among circulating porcine group A rotaviruses.
TI  - Use of essential oils and extracts from spices in meat protection.
AB  - The hydro distillation method was used in this study to get essential oils (EOs)  from cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.), clove (Eugenia caryohyllata) and Elecampane (Inula helenium L.) and the co-hydro distillation method (addition of fatty acid ethyl esters as extraction cosolvents) to get functional extracts (EFs). The MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and the MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) were determined on five pathogenic strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Toxoplasma Gondi). The results showed that essential oils of cumin and clove and their functional extracts are effective on concentrations from 500 mg/L to 750 mg/L. The essential oils with functional extracts were used on meat samples at three different concentrations: 750, 1,500 and 2,250 muL. The cumin essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log UFC/g with the application of 750 muL, the clove essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log UFC/g with the application of 2,250 muL and the cumin and clove functional extracts got a reduction of 3.6 log UFC/g. By chromatography, eugenol was identified in the clove oil, cuminaldehyde in the cumin oil and the isoalactolactones and alactolactones in the elecampane oil as main compounds on the chemical composition of the essential oils and functional extracts obtained.
TI  - Eutrophication and bacterial pathogens as risk factors for avian botulism outbreaks in wetlands receiving effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants.
AB  - Due to the scarcity of water resources in the "Mancha Humeda" Biosphere Reserve,  the use of treated wastewater has been proposed as a solution for the conservation of natural threatened floodplain wetlands. In addition, wastewater treatment plants of many villages pour their effluent into nearby natural lakes. We hypothesized that certain avian pathogens present in wastewater may cause avian mortalities which would trigger avian botulism outbreaks. With the aim of testing our hypothesis, 24 locations distributed in three wetlands, two that receive wastewater effluents and one serving as a control, were monitored during a year. Sediment, water, water bird feces, and invertebrates were collected for the detection of putative avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens type A, and Clostridium botulinum type C/D. Also, water and sediment physicochemical properties were determined. Overall, APEC, C. perfringens, and C. botulinum were significantly more prevalent in samples belonging to the wetlands which receive wastewater. The occurrence of a botulism outbreak in one of the studied wetlands coincided with high water temperatures and sediment 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), a decrease in water redox potential, chlorophyll a, and sulfate levels, and an increase in water inorganic carbon levels. The presence of C. botulinum in bird feces before the onset of the outbreak indicates that carrier birds exist and highlights the risk of botulinum toxin production in their carcasses if they die by other causes such as bacterial diseases, which are more probable in wastewater wetlands.
TI  - The effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain and mortality in 4 Danish pig herds.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study evaluated the effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain (ADG) and mortality and described the clinical manifestations in four herds suffering from the syndrome. NNPDS is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is not caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type A/C, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), rotavirus A, coronavirus, Cystoisospora suis, Strongyloides ransomi, Giardia spp or Cryptosporidium spp. RESULTS: Piglets were estimated to have a negative ADG of 9 and 14 g when diarrhoeic for 1 day and >1 day respectively. However, if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth, no negative effect on ADG was seen. Piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced ADG of 38 g. The study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but herd of origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with mortality. In one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis. These findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: NNPDS negatively affected ADG in piglets, and even piglets that were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in ADG. However, the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect ADG and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome. Since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on ADG, future research on NNPDS probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters.The study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds, and one herd was considerably more affected than the others. Within this herd, NNPDS seemed to be associated with a higher mortality, whereas in general the study did not show lethal effects of NNPDS.
TI  - Gas-forming liver abscess associated with rapid hemolysis in a diabetic patient.
AB  - We experienced a case of liver abscess due to Clostridium perfringens (CP) complicated with massive hemolysis and rapid death in an adequately controlled type 2 diabetic patient. The patient died 6 h after his first visit to the hospital. CP was later detected in a blood culture. We searched for case reports of CP septicemia and found 124 cases. Fifty patients survived, and 74 died. Of the 30 patients with liver abscess, only 3 cases survived following treatment with emergency surgical drainage. For the early detection of CP infection, detection of Gram-positive rods in the blood or drainage fluid is important. Spherocytes and ghost cells indicate intravascular hemolysis. The prognosis is very poor once massive hemolysis occurs. The major causative organisms of gas-forming liver abscess in diabetic patients are Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Although CP is relatively rare, the survival rate is very poor compared with those of K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Therefore, for every case that presents with a gas-forming liver abscess, the possibility of CP should be considered, and immediate aspiration of the abscess and Gram staining are important.
TI  - The impact of major earthquakes and subsequent sewage discharges on the microbial quality of water and sediments in an urban river.
AB  - A series of large earthquakes struck the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 2010-2011. Major damage sustained by the sewerage infrastructure required direct discharge of up to 38,000 m(3)/day of raw sewage into the Avon River of Christchurch for approximately six months. This allowed evaluation of the relationship between concentrations of indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and F-RNA phage) and pathogens (Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium) in recreational water and sediment both during and post-cessation of sewage discharges. Giardia was the pathogen found most frequently in river water and sediment, although Campylobacter was found at higher levels in water samples. E. coli levels in water above 550 CFU/100 mL were associated with increased likelihood of detection of Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium, supporting the use of E. coli as a reliable indicator for public health risk. The strength of the correlation of microbial indicators with pathogen detection in water decreased in the following order: E. coli>F-RNA phage>C. perfringens. All the microorganisms assayed in this study could be recovered from sediments. C. perfringens was observed to accumulate in sediments, which may have confounded its usefulness as an indicator of fresh sewage discharge. F-RNA phage, however, did not appear to accumulate in sediment and in conjunction with E. coli, may have potential as an indicator of recent human sewage discharge in freshwater. There is evidence to support the low-level persistence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, but not Campylobacter, in river sediments after cessation of sewage discharges. In the event of disturbances of the sediment, it is highly probable that there could be re-mobilisation of microorganisms beyond the sediment-water exchange processes occurring under base flow conditions. Re-suspension events do, therefore, increase the potential risk to human health for those who participate in recreational and work-related activities in the river environment.
TI  - Perfrin, a novel bacteriocin associated with netB positive Clostridium perfringens strains from broilers with necrotic enteritis.
AB  - Necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens is associated with netB positive Clostridium perfringens type A strains. It is known that C. perfringens strains isolated from outbreaks of necrotic enteritis are more capable of secreting factors inhibiting growth of other C. perfringens strains than strains isolated from the gut of healthy chickens. This characteristic could lead to extensive and selective presence of a strain that contains the genetic make-up enabling to secrete toxins that cause gut lesions. This report describes the discovery, purification, characterization and recombinant expression of a novel bacteriocin, referred to as perfrin, produced by a necrotic enteritis-associated netB-positive C. perfringens strain. Perfrin is a 11.5 kDa C-terminal fragment of a 22.9 kDa protein and showed no sequence homology to any currently known bacteriocin. The 11.5 kDa fragment can be cloned into Escherichia coli, and expression yielded an active peptide. PCR detection of the gene showed its presence in 10 netB-positive C. perfringens strains of broiler origin, and not in other C. perfringens strains tested (isolated from broilers, cattle, sheep, pigs, and humans). Perfrin and NetB are not located on the same genetic element since NetB is plasmid-encoded and perfrin is not. The bacteriocin has bactericidal activity over a wide pH-range but is thermolabile and sensitive to proteolytic digestion (trypsin, proteinase K). C. perfringens bacteriocins, such as perfrin, can be considered as an additional factor involved in the pathogenesis of necrotic enteritis in broilers.
TI  - Utility of the clostridial site-specific recombinase TnpX to clone toxic-product-encoding genes and selectively remove genomic DNA fragments.
AB  - TnpX is a site-specific recombinase responsible for the excision and insertion of the transposons Tn4451 and Tn4453 in Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, respectively. Here, we exploit phenotypic features of TnpX to facilitate genetic mutagenesis and complementation studies. Genetic manipulation of bacteria often relies on the use of antibiotic resistance genes; however, a limited number are available for use in the clostridia. The ability of TnpX to recognize and excise specific DNA fragments was exploited here as the basis of an antibiotic resistance marker recycling system, specifically to remove antibiotic resistance genes from plasmids in Escherichia coli and from marked chromosomal C. perfringens mutants. This methodology enabled the construction of a C. perfringens plc virR double mutant by allowing the removal and subsequent reuse of the same resistance gene to construct a second mutation. Genetic complementation can be challenging when the gene of interest encodes a product toxic to E. coli. We show that TnpX represses expression from its own promoter, PattCI, which can be exploited to facilitate the cloning of recalcitrant genes in E. coli for subsequent expression in the heterologous host C. perfringens. Importantly, this technology expands the repertoire of tools available for the genetic manipulation of the clostridia.
TI  - Production of human metabolites by gastrointestinal bacteria as a potential source of post-mortem alteration of antemortem drug/metabolite concentrations.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial species are capable of transforming complex chemical substances. Several of these species, native to the human gastrointestinal tract, are active in postmortem decomposition. They have potential to cause biotransformations affecting compound-to-metabolite ratios within the human body, especially after death. Investigation of postmortem effects could supply valuable information, especially concerning compound identification and confirmation. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens on diazepam and flunitrazepam in Reinforced Clostridial Medium, and to compare bacterial biotransformation products to those of human metabolism. A decrease in diazepam concentration between pre- and post-incubation was observed for samples inoculated with Escherichia coli (14.7-20.2%) as well as Bacteroides fragilis (13.9-25.7%); however there was no corresponding increase in concentration for the monitored human metabolites. Flunitrazepam demonstrated a greater concentration loss when incubated with individual bacterial species as well as mixed culture (79.2-100.0%). Samples incubated with Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and mixed culture resulted in nearly complete conversion of flunitrazepam. Increased 7-aminoflunitrazepam concentrations accounted for the majority of the conversion; however discrepancies in the mass balance of the reaction suggested the possibility of a minor metabolite that was not monitored in the current analysis. These experiments served as a pilot study and proof of concept that can be adapted and applied to a realm of possibilities. Ultimately, this methodology would be ideal to study compounds that are too toxic or lethal for animal and human metabolic investigations.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial effect of honey and Herba Ocimi Basilici against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the combination of different honey brands and methanolic fraction of Herba Ocimi Basilici using agar well diffusion assay. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was determined against thirteen pathogenic bacterial clinical isolates including six gram negative (Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimirium, Xanthomonas campestris) and six gram positive strains (Enterococcus faecalis faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens type C, Clostridium perfringens type D, Clostridium chauvoei). Agar well diffusion method was used while zones of inhibition were measured with vernier scale. RESULTS: At higher concentration, all the honey brands showed good to significant activity. The highest activity was observed for Hamdard brand honey (27.60 +/- 0.40) against Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that combinations of plant extracts of Herba Ocimi Basilici with honey can be used for the development of potent and novel antibacterial agents.
TI  - Evaluation of a multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial and viral enteropathogens in stool samples of paediatric patients.
AB  - We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay, the Seeplex Diarrhoea ACE detection, that simultaneously detects 15 enteric pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., toxin B producer Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, adenovirus, Group A rotavirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus. We compared this assay with clinical methods routinely used in our laboratory, for detecting enteropathogens in stool samples collected from 245 paediatric patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis. We recovered 61 bacterial pathogens and 121 enteric viruses with our laboratory assays, while we detected 78 bacteria and 167 viruses with the molecular assay. We calculated specificity and sensitivity for both methods after analysis of discordant results and demonstrated greater sensitivity for multiplex PCR than for our routine methods, with the exception of Salmonella spp. and toxigenic C. difficile detection. The multiplex PCR assay proved to be a reliable tool to directly detect the most common enteropathogens in stool samples but with some limitations.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (PLTs) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. We evaluated the BacTx assay (Immunetics, Inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis- and whole blood-derived PLT units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools, inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the BacTx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. Specificity on sterile PLTs and reproducibility across different PLT units and assay kit lots was also determined. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. In time-to-detection studies after inoculation of PLTs with 0.7 to 5.3 CFUs/mL, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 PLT units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. Specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The BacTx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) CFUs/mL threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. These findings suggest that the BacTx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in PLT units and pools near time of use.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization investigation of potentially pathogenic bacteria involved in neonatal porcine diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal diarrhea is a multifactorial condition commonly present on pig farms and leads to economic losses due to increased morbidity and mortality of piglets. Immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens. The microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets are: rotavirus A, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens type C, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi. However, in recent years, the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected. Potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., C. perfringens and C. difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four Danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens. Furthermore, an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for E. coli, C. perfringens and C. difficile was similar in both groups of piglets. However, Enterococcus spp. was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets. Furthermore, adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets. These bacteria were identified as E. coli and Enterococcus spp. and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-ETEC E. coli and Enterococcus spp. can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea. These bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets, when detection of common, well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful.
TI  - Isolation and identification of quercetin degrading bacteria from human fecal microbes.
AB  - Quercetin has a wide range of biological properties. The gut microflora can often modulate its biological activity and their potential health effects. There still is a lack of information about gut bacteria involving in this process. The strains of gut microbes from human feces that can transform quercetin were isolated and identified by in vitro fermentation. The results showed that Escherichia coli, Stretococcus lutetiensis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus gilvus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis have the various ability of degrading quercetin. Among them, C. perfringens and B. fragilis were discovered to have the strongest ability of degrading quercetin. Additionally, quercetin can't inhibit the growth of C. perfringens. In conclusion, many species of gut microbiota can degrade quercetin, but their ability are different.
TI  - Key design factors affecting microbial community composition and pathogenic organism removal in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands.
AB  - Constructed wetlands constitute an interesting option for wastewater reuse since  high concentrations of contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms can be removed with these natural treatment systems. In this work, the role of key design factors which could affect microbial removal and wetland performance, such as granular media, water depth and season effect was evaluated in a pilot system consisting of eight parallel horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands treating urban wastewater from Les Franqueses del Valles (Barcelona, Spain). Gravel biofilm as well as influent and effluent water samples of these systems were taken in order to detect the presence of bacterial indicators such as total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli, fecal enterococci (FE), Clostridium perfringens, and other microbial groups such as Pseudomonas and Aeromonas. The overall microbial inactivation ratio ranged between 1.4 and 2.9 log-units for heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), from 1.2 to 2.2 log units for total coliforms (TC) and from 1.4 to 2.3 log units for E. coli. The presence of fine granulometry strongly influenced the removal of all the bacterial groups analyzed. This effect was significant for TC (p=0.009), E. coli (p=0.004), and FE (p=0.012). Shallow HSSF constructed wetlands were more effective for removing Clostridium spores (p=0.039), and were also more efficient for removing TC (p=0.011) and E. coli (p=0.013) when fine granulometry was used. On the other hand, changes in the total bacterial community from gravel biofilm were examined by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified fragments of the 16S rRNA gene recovered from DGGE bands. Cluster analysis of the DGGE banding pattern from the different wetlands showed that microbial assemblages separated according to water depth, and sequences of different phylogenetic groups, such as Alpha, Beta and Delta-Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Synergistetes and Deferribacteres could be retrieved from DGGE bands.
TI  - Disease-outcome trees, EQ-5D scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the United States.
AB  - Measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. They provide a means of comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. We present detailed disease-outcome trees and EQ-5D scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the United States (Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio, and Yersinia enterocolitica). We estimate over 5800 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of L. monocytogenes and V. vulnificus, compared to 125 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of T. gondii, 26 for E. coli O157:H7, 16 for Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 14 for Y. enterocolitica. The remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 QALYs lost per 1000 cases. In total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in QALY loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total QALY loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. These estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. This study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Effects of Clostridium butyricum on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Clostridium butyricumon growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88. Three hundred sixty 1-d-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into 4 treatments: negative control (NC) birds were fed a basal diet and not challenged with E. coli K88; positive control (PC) birds were fed a basal diet and challenged with E. coli K88; C. butyricum treatment (CB) birds were fed a diet containing 2 x 10(7) cfu C. butyricum/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88; and colistin sulfate treatment (CS) birds were fed a diet containing 20 mg of colistin sulfate/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88. Birds fed CB had greater (P < 0.05) BW than the PC birds from 3 to 21 d postchallenge. Birds fed CB had greater (P < 0.05) serum IgA and IgY at 14 d postchallenge, greater (P < 0.05) serum IgM at 21 d postchallenge, and greater (P < 0.05) mucosal secreted IgA at 3 and 7 d postchallenge than the PC birds. Birds fed CB had greater concentrations of serum complement component 3 at 14 d postchallenge, and greater (P < 0.05) concentrations of serum complement component 4 at 3, 7, and 14 d postchallenge than the PC birds. Birds in the CS or CB treatments had less cecal E. coli population at 3, 7, and 21 d postchallenge, and less cecal Clostridium perfringens counts at 21 d postchallenge compared with the PC birds. The CB treatment increased (P < 0.05) the population of cecal Lactobacillus at 3 d postchallenge and the number of cecal Bifidobacterium at 3, 14, and 21 d postchallenge in comparison with the PC treatment. The results indicate that dietary supplementation of CB promotes growth performance, improves immune function, and benefits the cecal microflora in Escherichia coli K88-challenged chickens.
TI  - Multiple effects of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 on growth, biofilm formation, and inflammation cytokines profile of Clostridium perfringens type A strain CP4.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is an important Gram-positive pathogen responsible for food poisoning, necrotic enteritis, gas gangrene, and even death. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a well-characterized probiotic strain with demonstrated benefits. In this study, we evaluated the effects of EcN on growth, toxin production, biofilm formation, and inflammatory cytokine responses of C. perfringens. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated that EcN inhibited growth, gas production, and toxin production (alpha-toxin and NetB) of C. perfringens in a dose-dependent manner. The growth inhibition effect was not observed when C. perfringens was incubated with EcN cell-free supernatants (CFSE), suggesting that growth inhibition was caused by nutrition competition during co-incubation. In vitro studies demonstrated that pre-incubation with EcN did not inhibit C. perfringens attachment to Caco-2 cells, but did reduce C. perfringens total number, toxin production, and cytotoxicity after 24 h. The similar growth inhibition results were also observed during the formation of C. perfringens biofilm. Finally, pre-incubation of EcN with RAW264.7 cells significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines caused by the introduction of C. perfringens. Our results indicate that EcN can inhibit many of the pathological effects of C. perfringens in vitro conditions.
TI  - Alteration of predominant gastrointestinal flora and oxidative damage of large intestine under simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - Hypobaric hypoxia is an immediate and crucial starting mechanism of acute mountain sickness included with some non-specific gastrointestinal (GI) complications. To study the effect of hypoxia on GI microflora and its upshot to this system, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (air pressure ~ 4872.9 m altitude) consecutively 30 days for 8 hours/day. The different indicator group of large intestinal microbial populations were enumerated and correlated with the levels of antioxidant indicators like catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) of large intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, the histological study was performed by haematoxylin eosin (HE), periodic acid schiff staining (PAS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that the density of total aerobes (104 folds) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased but the population of total anaerobes (209 folds) and Escherichia coli (125 folds) elevated after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium spp. (3 folds), Bacteroides spp. (134 folds), Lactobacillus spp. (7 folds) and other selected obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens (40 folds), Peptostreptococcus spp. (21 folds) increased in respect to their control population. The growth direction index (GDI) of anaerobic populations was positive and correlated with gas formation aptitude. The activities of CAT and SOD in the large intestinal epithelia decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and GSH/GSSG pool turned into oxidized state with higher MDA (p < 0.05) formation. Histological study revealed the necrotized epithelial layer with higher lymphocytes infiltration in lamina propia accompanied by reduction of acidic mucins secreting goblet cells. From this experiment, it can be hypothesized that high altitude induced hypoxia manipulated the bacterial imprint and damaged the epithelial barrier of the large intestine which may cause systemic infection.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - Potentialities of newly isolated Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  - Two Bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16S rRNA sequence profile as Bacillus subtilis AKL1 and by biochemical process as Lactobacillus acidophilus AKL2. These isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. Different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (Mother Dairy and Thackar) curds. The total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of AKL1 and AKL2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). The antioxidant activity against ABTS+, DPPH8, OH* and Fe3+ were also higher in the newly formulated curd. Polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in AKL1+AKL2. All these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by SDS-PAGE. The curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentery, Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. It can be concluded that the combination of these Lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance for pathogenic microorganisms in groundwater near carcass burials constructed in South Korea in 2010.
AB  - Widespread outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza occurred in South Korea during 2010. In response to the culling of many animals to attenuate the spread of disease, South Korea used mass burial sites to dispose of the large number of carcasses; consequently, concerns about groundwater contamination by leachate from these burial sites are increasing. Groundwater is one of the main sources of drinking water, and its cleanliness is directly related to public health. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the safety of groundwater around the burial sites (total of 600 sites). A total of 1,200 groundwater samples were collected though the country, and microbial analysis was conducted during two time periods: during the spring (n = 600; April to June 2012) and after rainfall (n = 600; August to October, 2012; fall). Fecal coliform and Escherichia coli were detected in 173 (14.4%) and 85 (7.1%) of the 1,200 samples, respectively. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. each were detected only once (0.083%). Clostridium perfringens was detected from 7 groundwater samples (0.583%), and E. coli O157:H7 was not detected. With respect to norovirus, only the GII type was detected from six groundwater samples (0.5%), and enterovirus was detected in 15 groundwater samples (1.25%). The frequency of E. coli that we detected was lower than that found in previous studies conducted in South Korea, but we detected higher frequency of fecal coliform than that observed in a previous report. The contamination frequencies of Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were very low, but C. perfringens, which could be an indicator of fecal pollution, was detected in seven regions. Overall, the results of the present study indicate a low possibility of contamination from burial sites. However, consistent monitoring is required to prevent microbial contamination of groundwater near the burial sites.
TI  - Horizontally transferred genetic elements and their role in pathogenesis of bacterial disease.
AB  - This article reviews the roles that laterally transferred genes (LTG) play in the virulence of bacterial pathogens. The features of LTG that allow them to be recognized in bacterial genomes are described, and the mechanisms by which LTG are transferred between and within bacteria are reviewed. Genes on plasmids, integrative and conjugative elements, prophages, and pathogenicity islands are highlighted. Virulence genes that are frequently laterally transferred include genes for bacterial adherence to host cells, type 3 secretion systems, toxins, iron acquisition, and antimicrobial resistance. The specific roles of LTG in pathogenesis are illustrated by specific reference to Escherichia coli, Salmonella, pyogenic streptococci, and Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - [Diagnosis and control of human food poisoning outbreaks].
AB  - Medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. Bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially Norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. Culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. These new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified, and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.
TI  - Hygienization of sludge through anaerobic digestion at 35, 55 and 60 degrees C.
AB  - Legislation in Sweden and the European Union concerning the use of sewage sludge  in agriculture is under revision and future concentration limits for pathogens in treated sludge are likely to be expected. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hygienization of Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and Clostridium perfringens through continuous anaerobic digestion at 35, 55 or 60 degrees C, as well as to investigate process stability and methane production at 60 degrees C. The results indicated that digestion at 55 or 60 degrees C with a minimum exposure time of 2 h resulted in good reduction of Salmonella, E. coli and Enterococcus and that anaerobic digestion could thus be used to reach the concentration limits suggested for the EU, as well as Sweden. Furthermore, stable continuous anaerobic digestion of sludge was achieved at 60 degrees C, albeit with 10% less methane production compared to digestion at 35 and 55 degrees C.
TI  - Influence of dietary calcium level, calcium source, and phytase on bird performance and mineral digestibility during a natural necrotic enteritis episode.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the influence of Ca source [highly soluble calcified seaweed (HSC) or limestone], phytase supplementation, and dietary levels of Ca on bird performance and mineral digestibility (Ca and P) during a necrotic enteritis (NE) episode. Cobb 500 male broilers were weighed and randomized into 8 treatment groups (9 pens/treatment; 30 birds/pen) at day of hatch. The 21-d trial was designed as a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial, which included 2 dietary levels of Ca (0.6 and 0.9%), 2 Ca sources (limestone or HSC), and 2 levels of an Escherichia coli phytase (0 or 1,000 FTU/kg). One unit of phytase (FTU) is defined as the quantity of enzyme that releases 1 mumol of inorganic phosphorus/min from 0.00015 mol/L of sodium phytate at pH 5.5 at 37 degrees C. Birds were placed on used litter from a previous flock that exhibited clinical signs of NE. Birds and feed were weighed on d 7, 14, and 21, and BW gain, feed intake, and feed conversion were calculated for each of these periods and cumulatively. Mortality was recorded daily and pH of the gizzard and duodenum were measured on d 7, 14, and 21. Ileal digesta (8 birds/pen) was collected on d 7, 14, and 21. Significance is reported at P < 0.05. Birds began exhibiting clinical signs of NE on d 9, and elevated NE-associated mortality persisted until the end of the trial. Significantly higher mortality was observed when broilers were fed diets with 0.9% Ca from HSC compared with birds fed diets with 0.6% Ca, regardless of Ca source. Broilers fed 0.6% Ca diets supplemented with phytase were heavier than the other treatments regardless of Ca source. Broilers fed diets formulated with HSC had significantly higher feed conversion then broilers fed diets formulated with limestone. The gizzard of broilers fed 0.9% Ca in the diet was significantly less acidic than the gizzard of broilers fed 0.6% Ca in the diet. Broilers fed 0.6% Ca in diets supplemented with phytase showed significant improvements in P and Ca digestibility. In conclusion, higher dietary Ca (0.9% vs. 0.6%) had a negative effect on mortality associated with NE and on bird performance.
TI  - Performic acid for advanced wastewater disinfection.
AB  - The disinfection efficiency of performic acid (PFA) against various microbial contaminants has been studied in municipal secondary effluent. The study demonstrated that PFA provides rapid, efficient and safe disinfection, degrading both bacteria and viruses even at low doses. The resistance order starting from the most resistant microorganism is as follows: MS2-coliphages > DNA-coliphages > enterococci and Escherichia coli. PFA is also efficient in the elimination of Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens spores and Giardia cysts. The results showed that a PFA dose as low as 0.5-1 mg L(-1) with contact time of 10 min was efficient in achieving and maintaining for 72 h the disinfection level required for unrestricted agricultural water reuse (</=3 log units for faecal coliforms). However, the optimal dose will depend on the quality of wastewater. Regarding the formation of by-products during disinfection with PFA, very low amounts of hydrogen peroxide and organic per-acids were observed; active oxygen was not detected. The amounts of adsorbable organically bound halogens (AOX) compounds formed were significantly lower compared to the amounts generated during chlorine disinfection. This chlorine-free solution enables compliance with microbiological criteria for various water reuse applications and is already on the market for advanced disinfection.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of selected diseases in turkeys, laying hens, and minor poultry species in Canada.
AB  - This paper identifies common poultry diseases requiring antimicrobial therapy, antimicrobials deemed efficacious to treat these diseases, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in these commodity-pathogen combinations, and describes current residue issues and minor use minor species (MUMS) guidelines. Veterinarians with turkey/layer expertise and diagnosticians were surveyed to determine the bacterial and protozoal diseases diagnosed in the last 5 years. Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale were the 3 most frequently diagnosed pathogens of turkeys. In layers, E. coli-peritonitis, and Clostridium perfringens/Eimeria spp. infections were the most common diagnoses. A literature review identified 32 antimicrobials as efficacious and/or recommended for treating these diseases. Surveillance and monitoring indicate the presence of enteric resistant organisms from some of these avian species (including resistance to antimicrobials of very high importance to human medicine). This paper highlights the need for surveillance of pathogen frequency, antimicrobial use (AMU), and AMR particularly in turkeys.
TI  - Bio-preservation of ground beef meat by Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121.
AB  - Meat and particularly ground beef is frequently associated with Food Poisoning episodes and breeches in Food Safety. The main goal of this research was to evaluate the bactericide effect of the probiotic Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121, against different pathogens as: Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes, inoculated in ground beef meat. Three studies were performed to evaluate the inhibition of E. faecalis CECT7121 on ground beef meat samples inoculated with pathogens: Study I: Samples (100 g meat) were inoculated with pathogens (10(3) CFU/g)) and E. faecalis CECT7121 (10(4) CFU/g) simultaneously. Study II: Samples were inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121 24 h before the pathogens. Study III: E. faecalis CECT7121were inoculated 24 h after pathogens. The viable counts were performed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation. The simultaneous inoculation of E. faecalis CECT7121 with E. coli O157:H7 strains resulted in the absence of viable counts of bacteria at 72 h post-treatment. However, when the probiotic was added 24 h before and 24 h after the pathogen E. coli O157:H7, viable cells were not detected at 24 h and 48 h post-treatment, respectively. Consistently, neither S. aureus nor Cl. perfringens viable bacteria were detected at 48 h in whole assays when inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121. The same trend than described before was obtained after applying the 3 models assayed for L. monocytogenes. The current assays demonstrated the bactericide activity of E. faecalis CECT7121 strain on bacterial pathogens in ground beef meat.
TI  - Effects of a probiotic, Enterococcus faecium, on growth performance, intestinal morphology, immune response, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88.
AB  - The effects of feeding dehydrated Enterococcus faecium on growth performance, immune response, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88 were investigated. Two hundred eighty-eight 1-d-old birds were randomly assigned to 4 treatments: negative control birds (N-con) fed a basal diet and not challenged with E. coli K88; positive control birds (P-con) fed a basal diet and challenged with E. coli K88; birds fed a basal diet including dehydrated E. faecium (Ef) at 1 x 10(9) cfu/kg of feed and challenged with E. coli K88; and birds fed a basal diet including the antibiotic colistine sulfate (Anti) at 10 mg/kg of feed and challenged with E. coli K88. Birds fed E. faecium had greater (P < 0.05) BW on d 14, 21, and 28 and greater (P < 0.05) jejunal villus height on d 21 and 28 compared with birds on the other treatments. Jejunal crypt depth was decreased (P < 0.05) in birds fed either E. faecium or antibiotic compared with P-con treatment birds on d 10, 21, and 28. Birds fed E. faecium had a greater (P < 0.05) concentration of IL-4 in their jejunal mucosa than did those in the N-con treatment group on d 10, 14, and 21. Infected birds, with or without E. faecium feeding, had a higher (P < 0.05) tumor necrosis factor-alpha and secreted IgA in their jejunal mucosa than did those in the N-con treatment group on d 10 and 14. Birds fed E. faecium had lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of E. coli on d 14 and 28, less (P < 0.05) Clostridium perfringens on d 28, greater Lactobacillus counts on d 14 and 21, and greater (P < 0.05) Bifidobacterium in their cecal contents on d 21 than did the P-con birds. These results suggest that E. faecium can promote growth performance, improve intestinal morphology, and beneficially manipulate the cecal microflora in broilers challenged with E. coli K88.
TI  - A retrospective study on the etiological diagnoses of diarrhea in neonatal piglets in Ontario, Canada, between 2001 and 2010.
AB  - Laboratory surveillance data from the Animal Health Laboratory, University of Guelph, on the etiological diagnoses of neonatal diarrhea in piglets were analyzed to determine the relative importance and trends of different enteric pathogens in Ontario. A total of 237 cases, including live and dead 1- to 7-day-old piglets, were submitted for diagnosis of gastrointestinal illness between 2001 and 2010. The combined frequencies for cases of gastrointestinal illness involving Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens type A, rotavirus, and Clostridium difficile, either as single pathogens or a complex of pathogens, accounted for 56% of the total cases. In a total of 33% of cases of gastrointestinal illness, an etiological agent was not identified. The frequency of cases diagnosed with enterotoxigenic E. coli was decreased from 2007. Cases submitted in 2010 were more likely to be diagnosed with C. perfringens type A compared to cases submitted in 2002 to 2007 (P < 0.05). There was a significant trend for cases submitted in the winter to be diagnosed with C. perfringens type A, enterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus, and Cystoisospora suis (formerly Isospora suis) (P < 0.05). Enterotoxigenic E. coli was less likely diagnosed if C. difficile, C. perfringens, or rotavirus were detected (P < 0.05). Younger piglets were more likely to be diagnosed with C. perfringens type A (P < 0.05) and C. difficile (P < 0.05) than older piglets. This study shows that E. coli, C. perfringens type A, rotavirus, and C. difficile are enteric pathogens of concern for Ontario swine farrowing operations and further research is required to understand the reasons for the cases that are not diagnosed.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Abilities of the mCP Agar method and CRENAME alpha toxin-specific real-time PCR assay to detect Clostridium perfringens spores in drinking water.
AB  - We first determined the analytical specificity and ubiquity (i.e., the ability to detect all or most strains) of a Clostridium perfringens-specific real-time PCR (rtPCR) assay based on the cpa gene (cpa rtPCR) by using a bacterial strain panel composed of C. perfringens and non-C. perfringens Clostridium strains. All non-C. perfringens Clostridium strains tested negative, whereas all C. perfringens strains tested positive with the cpa rtPCR, for an analytical specificity and ubiquity of 100%. The cpa rtPCR assay was then used to confirm the identity of 116 putative C. perfringens isolates recovered after filtration of water samples and culture on mCP agar. Colonies presenting discordant results between the phenotype on mCP agar and cpa rtPCR were identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA and cpa genes. Four mCP(-)/rtPCR(+) colonies were identified as C. perfringens, whereas 3 mCP(+)/rtPCR(-) colonies were identified as non-C. perfringens. The cpa rtPCR was negative with all 51 non-C. perfringens strains and positive with 64 of 65 C. perfringens strains. Finally, we compared mCP agar and a CRENAME (concentration and recovery of microbial particles, extraction of nucleic acids, and molecular enrichment) procedure plus cpa rtPCR (CRENAME + cpa rtPCR) for their abilities to detect C. perfringens spores in drinking water. CRENAME + cpa rtPCR detected as few as one C. perfringens CFU per 100 ml of drinking water sample in less than 5 h, whereas mCP agar took at least 25 h to deliver results. CRENAME + cpa rtPCR also allows the simultaneous and sensitive detection of Escherichia coli and C. perfringens from the same potable water sample. In itself, it could be used to assess the public health risk posed by drinking water potentially contaminated with pathogens more resistant to disinfection.
TI  - Expression and delivery of an endolysin to combat Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a cause for increasing concern due to its responsibility for severe infections both in humans and animals, especially poultry. To find new control strategies to treat C. perfringens infection, we investigated the activity and delivery of a bacteriophage endolysin. We identified a new endolysin, designated CP25L, which shows similarity to an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase domain and is distinct from other C. perfringens endolysins whose activity has been demonstrated in vitro. The cp25l gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product demonstrated lytic activity against all 25 C. perfringens strains tested. The probiotic strain Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 was engineered to deliver the endolysin to the gastrointestinal tract. The integration of the nisRK two-component regulatory system from the Lactococcus lactis nisin A biosynthesis operon into the chromosome of L. johnsonii allowed constitutive expression of the endolysin under the control of the nisA promoter (P nisA ), while the use of a signal peptide (SLPmod) led to successful secretion of the active endolysin to the surrounding media. The high specificity and activity of the endolysin suggest that it may be developed as an effective tool to enhance the control of C. perfringens by L. johnsonii in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Expression of a Clostridium perfringens genome-encoded putative N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase as a potential antimicrobial to control the bacterium.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that plays a substantial role in non-foodborne human, animal, and avian diseases as well as human foodborne disease. Previously discovered C. perfringens bacteriophage lytic enzyme amino acid sequences were utilized to identify putative prophage lysins or autolysins by BLAST analyses encoded by the genomes of C. perfringens isolates. A predicted N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase or MurNAc-LAA (also known as peptidoglycan aminohydrolase, NAMLA amidase, NAMLAA, amidase 3, and peptidoglycan amidase; EC 3.5.1.28) was identified that would hydrolyze the amide bond between N-acetylmuramoyl and L-amino acids in certain cell wall glycopeptides. The gene encoding this protein was subsequently cloned from genomic DNA of a C. perfringens isolate by polymerase chain reaction, and the gene product (PlyCpAmi) was expressed to determine if it could be utilized as an antimicrobial to control the bacterium. By spot assay, lytic zones were observed for the purified amidase and the E. coli expression host cellular lysate containing the amidase gene. Turbidity reduction and plate counts of C. perfringens cultures were significantly reduced by the expressed protein and observed morphologies for cells treated with the amidase appeared vacuolated, non-intact, and injured compared to the untreated cells. Among a variety of C. perfringens strains, there was little gene sequence heterogeneity that varied from 1 to 21 nucleotide differences. The results further demonstrate that it is possible to discover lytic proteins encoded in the genomes of bacteria that could be utilized to control bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Enteropathogens in pups from pet shops and breeding facilities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate faecal and clinical scores and presence of several enteropathogens possibly implicated in the development of diarrhoea in pups aged between 6 and 16 weeks independently of their health status. METHODS: Pups were selected from pet shops and breeding facilities and assigned a faecal and clinical score. Standard isolation methods were used to determine presence of parasites, viruses and bacteria in faecal samples. For Escherichia coli, virulence genes were assessed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fifty-six pups were included in this study. Eighteen had no diarrhoea, 22 had no significant clinical signs related to gastroenteritis. Samples were positive for Toxocara canis (n=29), Giardia duodenalis (n=35), Cystoisospora (n=22), E. coli (n=47) and Clostridium perfringens (n=20). In four E. coli positive samples, genes were detected that correlate with pathogenicity in other animal species. A significant positive correlation between the presence of T. canis and faecal score was found. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Puppies obtained from a pet shop or breeding facility have a high risk of gastrointestinal disease. Furthermore, infectious agents may be present independently of faecal or clinical score. The identification of possible pathogenic E. coli strains suggests that their role in diarrhoea warrant further investigation.
TI  - Binding of the biogenic polyamines to deoxyribonucleic acids of varying base composition: base specificity and the associated energetics of the interaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The thermodynamics of the base pair specificity of the binding of the polyamines spermine, spermidine, putrescine, and cadaverine with three genomic DNAs Clostridium perfringens, 27% GC, Escherichia coli, 50% GC and Micrococcus lysodeikticus, 72% GC have been studied using titration calorimetry and the data supplemented with melting studies, ethidium displacement and circular dichroism spectroscopy results. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, optical melting studies, ethidium displacement, circular dichroism spectroscopy are the various techniques employed to characterize the interaction of four polyamines, spermine, spermidine, putersine and cadaverine with the DNAs. Polyamines bound stronger with AT rich DNA compared to the GC rich DNA and the binding varied depending on the charge on the polyamine as spermine>spermidine >putrescine>cadaverine. Thermodynamics of the interaction revealed that the binding was entropy driven with small enthalpy contribution. The binding was influenced by salt concentration suggesting the contribution from electrostatic forces to the Gibbs energy of binding to be the dominant contributor. Each system studied exhibited enthalpy-entropy compensation. The negative heat capacity changes suggested a role for hydrophobic interactions which may arise due to the non polar interactions between DNA and polyamines. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: From a thermodynamic analysis, the AT base specificity of polyamines to DNAs has been elucidated for the first time and supplemented by structural studies.
TI  - Case-control study of microbiological etiology associated with calf diarrhea.
AB  - Calf diarrhea is a major economic burden for the US cattle industry. A variety of infectious agents are implicated in calf diarrhea and co-infection of multiple pathogens is not uncommon in diarrheic calves. A case-control study was conducted to assess infectious etiologies associated with calf diarrhea in Midwest cattle farms. A total of 199 and 245 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively, from 165 cattle farms. Samples were tested by a panel of multiplex PCR assays for 11 enteric pathogens: bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine torovirus (BToV) Salmonella spp. (Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99(+), Clostridium perfringens with beta toxin gene and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum). The association between diarrhea and detection of each pathogen was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. More than a half of the fecal samples from the diarrheic calves had multiple pathogens. Statistically, BRV-A, BCoV, BNoV, Nebovirus, Salmonella, E. coli K99(+), and C. parvum were significantly associated with calf diarrhea (p<0.05). Among them, C. parvum and BRV-A were considered to be the most common enteric pathogens for calf diarrhea with high detection frequency (33.7% and 27.1%) and strong odds ratio (173 and 79.9). Unexpectedly BNoV (OR=2.0) and Nebovirus (OR=16.7) were identified with high frequency in diarrheic calves, suggesting these viruses may have a significant contribution to calf diarrhea.
TI  - A novel watery diarrhoea caused by the co-infection of neonatal piglets with Clostridium perfringens type A and Escherichia coli (K88, 987P).
AB  - In 2011, a novel watery diarrhoea in 1-7 day-old piglets occurred in Changchun, China, characterized by high pathogenicity and mortality. Investigation of clinical signs, examination for viruses, and isolation and identification of bacteria showed that co-infection by Clostridium perfringens type A and Escherichia coli (K88, 987P) was the most likely cause of the disease. Newborn piglets challenged with a mixture of Clostridium perfringens type A and Escherichia coli (K88, 987P) died within 3 days with clinical signs and gross lesions similar to those in the piglets that died in the outbreak. A subsequent study showed that the use in sows of an inactivated vaccine against the two causal bacteria was effective at reducing the incidence of the watery diarrhoea in piglets. Piglets from sows given the inactivated vaccine had a incidence of watery diarrhoea of 8% (14/175), much lower than the 95% (192/201) seen in piglets from control sows. This is the first report of diarrhoea in piglets resulting from co-infection of Clostridium perfringens type A and Escherichia coli (K88, 987P). Further studies are required to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease.
TI  - Vaccination with recombinant Clostridium perfringens toxoids alpha and beta promotes elevated antepartum and passive humoral immunity in swine.
AB  - Due to the increasingly restricted use of antimicrobials in animal production systems, the prevention and control of Clostridium perfringens type A- and C-induced diarrhea in piglets should be based on passive immunization via the prepartum vaccination of sows. Given the current obstacles in the production of conventional clostridial vaccines, the use of recombinant proteins has been considered to represent a promising alternative. In the present study, the neutralizing antibody response of immunized sows and their litters to a bivalent vaccine containing the C. perfringens recombinant toxoids alpha (rTA) and beta (rTB) produced in Escherichia coli was assessed. Rabbits (n=8) and pregnant sows (n=7) were immunized with 200mug of each recombinant antigen using Al(OH)3 as adjuvant. The alpha and beta antitoxin titer detected in the rabbits' serum pool was 9.6 and 20.4IU/mL, respectively. The mean alpha and beta antitoxin titers in the sows' sera were 6.0+/-0.9IU/mL and 14.5+/-2.2IU/mL, and the corresponding individual coefficients of variation (CV) were 16.04% and 14.91%, respectively. The mean alpha and beta antitoxin titers in the litters' serum pools were 4.2+/-0.4IU/mL and 10.9+/-1.7IU/mL, and the CV between litters was 9.23% and 9.85%, respectively. The results showed that the rTA and rTB proteins produced and tested in the present study induced an immune response and can be regarded as candidates for the development of a commercial vaccine against C. perfringens type A- and C-induced diarrhea in pigs.
TI  - A low-toxic site-directed mutant of Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin as a potential candidate vaccine against enterotoxemia.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin (ETX), one of the most potent toxins known, is a potential biological weapon; therefore, the development of an effective vaccine is important for preventing intoxication or disease by ETX. In this study, genetically detoxified epsilon toxin mutants were developed as candidate vaccines. We used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate the essential amino acid residues (His106, Ser111 and Phe199). Six site-directed mutants of ETX (mETX (H106P) , mETX (S111H) , mETX (S111Y) , mETX (F199H) , mETX (F199E) , mETX (S111YF199E) ) were generated and then expressed in Escherichia coli. Both mETX (F199E) and mETX (H106P) with low or non-cytotoxicity that retained their immunogenicity were selected to immunize mice 3 times, and the mouse survival data were recorded after challenging with recombinant wild-type ETX. mETX (F199E) induces the same protection as mETX (H106P) , which was reported previously as a promising toxin mutant for vaccine, and both of them could protect immunized mice against a 100x LD(5)(0) dose of active wild-type recombinant ETX. This work showed that mETX (F199E) is another promising candidate vaccine against enterotoxemia and other diseases caused by ETX.
TI  - An investigation into the association between cpb2-encoding Clostridium perfringens type A and diarrhea in neonatal piglets.
AB  - To investigate the possible role of cpb2-positive type A Clostridium perfringens  in neonatal diarrheal illness in pigs, the jejunum and colon of matched normal and diarrheic piglets from 10 farms with a history of neonatal diarrhea were examined grossly and by histopathology, and tested for C. perfringens, for C. perfringens beta2 (CPB2) toxin, as well as for Clostridium difficile toxins, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and coccidia. Clostridium perfringens isolates were tested using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the presence of cpa, consensus and atypical cpb2, and other virulence-associated genes. The numbers of C. perfringens in the intestinal contents were lower in diarrheic piglets (log(1)(0) 5.4 CFU/g) compared with normal piglets (log(1)(0) 6.5 CFU/g) (P < 0.05). The consensus cpb2 was present in 93% of isolates in each group, but atypical cpb2 was less common (56% healthy, 32% diarrheic piglets isolates, respectively, P < 0.05). The presence of CPB2 toxin in the intestinal contents of normal and diarrheic piglets did not differ significantly. Clostridium difficile toxins and rotavirus were each detected in 7 of the 21 (33%) diarrheic piglets. Rotavirus, C. difficile toxins, Salmonella, or enterotoxigenic E. coli were concurrently recovered in different combinations in 4 diarrheic piglets. The cause of diarrhea in 8 of the 21 (38%) piglets on 6 farms remained unknown. The etiological diagnosis of diarrhea could not be determined in any of the piglets on 2 of the farms. This study demonstrated that the number of cpb2-positive type A C. perfringens in the intestinal contents was not a useful approach for making a diagnosis of type A C. perfringens enteritis in piglets. Further work is required to confirm whether cpb2-carrying type A C. perfringens have a pathogenic role in enteric infection in neonatal swine.
TI  - Mode of binding of RNA polymerase alpha subunit to the phased A-tracts upstream of the phospholipase C gene promoter of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Three phased A5-6-tracts lie upstream of the promoter of plc encoding the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) of Clostridium perfringens. The alpha subunits of C. perfringens RNA polymerase bind directly to the phased A-tracts via the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit (alphaCTD). To identify the amino acid residues involved in the binding of C. perfringens alpha subunits to the phased A-tracts, 27 amino acid residues in C. perfringens alphaCTD were substituted with alanine. The affinities of the mutated alpha subunits for the phased A-tracts were examined by gel shift assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The SPR analyses revealed that the phased A-tracts themselves facilitated a complex formation between the phased A-tracts and C. perfringens alpha subunits [Kd was 6.1 (+/-0.3) x 10(-8) M], and that Arg261, Asn264, Gly292 and Lys294 in C. perfringens alphaCTD were critical for the binding to the phased A-tracts. The topology of these amino acid residues on the predicted structure of C. perfringens alphaCTD indicated a contact path with the phased A-tracts that was similar to that of Escherichia coli alphaCTD with the upstream (UP) element. On the other hand, SPR analyses at different temperatures (15, 25 and 37 degrees C) indicated that the affinity of the C. perfringens alpha subunits for the phased A-tracts increased in a low-temperature-dependent manner, whereas that of the E. coli alpha subunit for the UP element did not. This suggests that the phased A-tracts may not simply be a subset of the UP element, and that they show specific binding activity with the RNA polymerase alpha subunit.
TI  - Determination of microbial quality and plasmid-mediated multidrug resistant bacteria in fountain drinking water sources in Turkey.
AB  - The bacterial contamination as the total aerobic bacteria, coliform and fecal coliform numbers were determined and analyzed for temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen in seasonally collected water samples from fifteen different stations placed in Adana-Tufanbeyli road line during March 2008 - January 2009. In addition, antibiotic resistance profiles of isolates were examined against frequently used antibiotics, and analyzed plasmid DNAof multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) isolates. Total aerobic bacteria in fountain water samples was determined as 3 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and total and fecal coliforms were determined 460 MPN/100 ml. Results obtained from biochemical analysis showed that 121 of the isolates were Proteus vulgaris, 69 Escherichia coli, 51 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 28 Citrobacter spp. According to these results, the existence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in stations 2 and 10, and Streptococcus faecalis in stations 11 and 15 respectively were confirmed. Clostridium perfringens was not detected in water samples. A total of 273 isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by agar disc diffusion methods. A total of sixteen antibiotics were used for determination of antibiotic resistance of isolates. Resistance to bacitracin, vancomycine, cephalothin and ampicillin was detected in 77, 77, 63 and 50%, respectively. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) value > or = 0.25 was determined in 68.4% of identified 273 isolates and meaning of this percentage were resistant to four and more antibiotics. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 22 isolates with multiple antibiotic resistance index ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 taken randomly by agarose-gel electrophoresis, some of them contain a high-molecular weight plasmid DNA. Highlight of our study that the appearance of potential antibiotic resistances in fountain drinking water requires increased surveillance for risk assessment and prevention strategies to protect public health.
TI  - Review of antimicrobial therapy of selected bacterial diseases in broiler chickens in Canada.
AB  - This paper reviews common therapeutic applications of antimicrobials in broiler chicken production in relation to Canadian guidelines, surveillance data, and emerging public health concerns about antimicrobial use (AMU). Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus spp., were reviewed because of their animal health and economic significance. Enterococcus cecorum and Salmonella were included because of their importance in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance. This review identified that i) antimicrobials are available in Canada to treat infections by these agents, but may be through over the counter or extra-label use, ii) prevalence rates for these diseases are unknown, iii) antimicrobial use estimates in broilers are lacking, and iv) AMR has emerged in clinical isolates, though data are very sparse. This review highlights the need for surveillance of AMU and AMR in broiler chickens in Canada.
TI  - Pathogenic microbiological baseline survey of pork carcasses in Taiwan.
AB  - From 2004 to 2010, pork carcass swabs from state-inspected slaughter plants in Taiwan were intermittently analyzed to determine the prevalence of selected pathogenic microorganisms associated with foodborne illness. The prevalences of Staphylococcus aureus each year from 2006 to 2010 were 6.6, 10.8, 5.1, 6.4, and 7.4%, respectively, while those of Listeria monocytogenes were 1.2% in 2004, 1.3% in 2005, and 3.5% in 2008. The prevalences of Clostridium perfringens were 0.9% in 2004, 3.2% in 2005, and 1.1% in 2008. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli had a higher recovery rate than the other surveyed microorganisms, with prevalences during 2004, 2005, and 2008 of 21.1, 13.7, and 8.1%, respectively. Salmonella strains were analyzed each year, and their prevalences ranged between 3.0 and 6.9%. Derby, Typhimurium, Anatum, Choleraesuis, and Agona were the five serovars most frequently identified among the Salmonella isolates. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was not detected in 2004, 2005, or 2010. Routine baseline surveying of pork carcasses to determine the prevalence of selected pathogens of concern for food safety can provide valuable information regarding the effectiveness of the slaughtering procedures or the need for interventions.
TI  - Expression of Clostridium perfringens epsilon-beta fusion toxin gene in E. coli and its immunologic studies in mouse.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic spore-forming, pathogenic bacterium that  is responsible for severe diseases in humans and livestock. In the present study, an epsilon-beta fusion toxin was expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli and the recombinant cell lysate was used for immunization studies in mouse. Potency of the toxin (as an antigen) induced 6 and 10IU/ml of epsilon and beta anti-toxin in rabbit, respectively. These titers were higher than the minimum level required by the European Pharmacopoeia for epsilon and beta toxins. Experimental challenge with the recombinant fusion toxoid revealed that it could protect mice against C. perfringens epsilon and beta toxins. Toxicity of the fusion toxin was studied by histopathological findings, which were the same as the native toxins. In conclusion, E. coli is a suitable expression host for immunogenic epsilon-beta fusion toxin of C. perfringens.
TI  - Immunity to bacterial infection in the chicken.
AB  - Bacterial infections remain important to the poultry industry both in terms of animal and public health, the latter due to the importance of poultry as a source of foodborne bacterial zoonoses such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. As such, much focus of research to the immune response to bacterial infection has been to Salmonella. In this review we will focus on how research on avian salmonellosis has developed our understanding of immunity to bacteria in the chicken from understanding the role of TLRs in recognition of bacterial pathogens, through the role of heterophils, macrophages and gammadelta lymphocytes in innate immunity and activation of adaptive responses to the role of cellular and humoral immunity in immune clearance and protection. What is known of the immune response to other bacterial infections and in particular infections that have emerged recently as major problems in poultry production including Campylobacter jejuni, Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale and Clostridium perfringens are discussed.
TI  - Pork implicated in a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak in Ontario, Canada.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 infection following a four-day family gathering in Ontario. This is the first published account of a STEC O157 outbreak in Canada linked to consumption of pork. METHODS: The outbreak investigation included interviews with food handlers and other key associated persons, inspection of food preparation premises, traceback investigations, case finding, analysis of data from an outbreak questionnaire, and laboratory analysis of samples collected from various sources associated with the outbreak. RESULTS: Several meals, including pork from a pig roast, were served to the 59 attendees, 29 of whom developed gastrointestinal illness following the event. Six cases developed bloody diarrhoea and seven were hospitalized. Leftover pork served the day after the pig roast was the item most significantly associated with an increased risk of illness (p<0.001). STEC O157:H7 was isolated from 11 of the 29 ill attendees, and also from the pork. By pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), all STEC O157:H7 pork isolates were either identical or closely related to the 11 clinical isolates. No STEC was detected in any other samples. Three Clostridium perfringens isolates, unrelated by PFGE, were obtained from two STEC-positive cases and the pork. CONCLUSION: This outbreak highlights the need for increased awareness of pork as a potential source of STEC O157 infection, and for enhanced education regarding the safe handling, cooking and storage of food, specifically where large cuts of meat are cooked outdoors at events such as pig roasts, a cultural norm in some communities.
TI  - Development and application of a multiplex PCR assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  - Infections with Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Riemerella anatipestifer, and Escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. It can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. Thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single tube reaction. The target genes used were KMT1 of P. multocida, the invasion protein gene of S. enterica, 16S rDNA of R. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of E. coli. The detection limit of the assay for all bacterial DNA was 10 pg. The mPCR did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. We applied mPCR to field samples, and the results were the same as the single PCR results. These results suggest that mPCR for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.
TI  - Disulfide-bond scanning reveals assembly state and beta-strand tilt angle of the  PFO beta-barrel.
AB  - Perfringolysin O (PFO), a bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, binds a mammalian cell membrane, oligomerizes into a circular prepore complex (PPC) and forms a 250-A transmembrane beta-barrel pore in the cell membrane. Each PFO monomer has two sets of three short alpha-helices that unfold and ultimately refold into two transmembrane beta-hairpin (TMH) components of the membrane-embedded beta-barrel. Interstrand disulfide-bond scanning revealed that beta-strands in a fully assembled PFO beta-barrel were strictly aligned and tilted at 20 degrees to the membrane perpendicular. In contrast, in a low temperature-trapped PPC intermediate, the TMHs were unfolded and had sufficient freedom of motion to interact transiently with each other, yet the TMHs were not aligned or stably hydrogen bonded. The PFO PPC-to-pore transition therefore converts TMHs in a dynamic folding intermediate far above the membrane into TMHs that are hydrogen bonded to those of adjacent subunits in the bilayer-embedded beta-barrel.
TI  - Oligomerization and hemolytic properties of the C-terminal domain of pyolysin, a  cholesterol-dependent cytolysin.
AB  - Pyolysin (PLO) belongs to the homologous family of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs), which bind to cell membranes containing cholesterol to form oligomeric pores of large size. The CDC monomer structure consists of 4 domains. Among these, the C-terminal domain 4 has been implicated in membrane binding of the monomer, while the subsequent processes of oligomerization and membrane insertion have primarily been assigned to other domains of the molecule. Recombinantly expressed or proteolytic fragments that span domain 4 of the CDCs streptolysin O and perfringolysin O bind to membranes but fail to oligomerize, and they inhibit the activity of the respective wild-type toxins. We report here that the isolated domain 4 of pyolysin (PLO-D4) not only binds to membranes but also forms oligomers with itself, as well as hybrid oligomers with the full-length toxin. As expected, the pure PLO-D4 oligomers are devoid of pore-forming activity. Surprisingly, however, within hybrid oligomers, PLO-D4 not only fails to inhibit, but even amplifies the hemolytic activity of the full-length toxin, to an extent similar to that of doubling the amount of the full-length toxin alone. We propose that this amplification may be related to the kinetics of the oligomerization reaction. Overall, our findings indicate a greater role of domain 4 in the oligomerization of CDCs than previously demonstrated.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - Bacteriocin production by Bifidobacterium spp. A review.
AB  - Bacteriocins are ribosomally-synthesized antibacterial peptides. These compounds  are produced by a broad variety of different bacteria belonging mainly to the genus Bifidobacterium, to which health promoting properties have frequently been attributed. However, despite the fact that the identification of Bifidobacterium-associated bacteriocins was first reported in 1980 and that they exhibit antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli, relatively little information is still available about the antimicrobial compounds produced by strains of this genus. More detailed understanding of the action mechanisms of these antimicrobials could allow us to determine the extent to which their production contributes to the probiotic properties of specific bifidobacteria strains and, potentially, be of crucial significance for ultimate preservation of functional foods or pharmaceutical applications. Here we review what is already known about their structure, classification, mode of action, functionality, immunity, production and purification.
TI  - Coinfection in acute gastroenteritis predicts a more severe clinical course in children.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of enteric pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among hospitalized children in a large Italian hospital, to measure the incidence of coinfections, and to compare the clinical characteristics of those infected with one versus multiple agents. A prospective study was conducted from March 2010 to April 2011 at the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital in Rome, Italy. All patients between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted to the Pediatric Department with a diagnosis of AGE were eligible for enrollment. Two stool samples for each patient were tested for gastrointestinal pathogens. We summarized the clinical severity of episodes, describing the duration of diarrhea, duration and frequency of vomiting, fever, and severity of dehydration. All the patients underwent medical evaluation with estimation of dehydration. One or more etiological agents were detected in 151 out of 232 patients (65.1%), while we did not detect any etiological agent in 81 (34.9%). Rotavirus was detected in 96 (63.6%), adenovirus in 17 (11.2%), norovirus in 7 (4.6%), toxin-producing Clostridium difficile in 23 (15.2%), Salmonella spp. in 15 (9.9%, B group in 12/15 and D group in 3/15), C. perfringens in 12 (7.9%), Campylobacter spp. in 6 (4%), and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) in 2 (1.3%). In 27 children out of 151 (17.9%), we found evidence of coinfection. Coinfection with rotavirus and toxin-producing C. difficile was the most common (63%). Children with coinfection had a more severe clinical presentation and had a higher probability to be severely dehydrated, independently of age and living community type.
TI  - Ammonia production by human faecal bacteria, and the enumeration, isolation and characterization of bacteria capable of growth on peptides and amino acids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The products of protein breakdown in the human colon are considered to be detrimental to gut health. Amino acid catabolism leads to the formation of sulfides, phenolic compounds and amines, which are inflammatory and/or precursors to the formation of carcinogens, including N-nitroso compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of protein breakdown and the bacterial species involved. RESULTS: Casein, pancreatic casein hydrolysate (mainly short-chain peptides) or amino acids were incubated in vitro with suspensions of faecal bacteria from 3 omnivorous and 3 vegetarian human donors. Results from the two donor groups were similar. Ammonia production was highest from peptides, followed by casein and amino acids, which were similar. The amino acids metabolized most extensively were Asp, Ser, Lys and Glu. Monensin inhibited the rate of ammonia production from amino acids by 60% (P = 0.001), indicating the involvement of Gram-positive bacteria. Enrichment cultures were carried out to investigate if, by analogy with the rumen, there was a significant population of asaccharolytic, obligately amino acid-fermenting bacteria ('hyper-ammonia-producing' bacteria; HAP) in the colon. Numbers of bacteria capable of growth on peptides or amino acids alone averaged 3.5% of the total viable count, somewhat higher than the rumen. None of these were HAP, however. The species enriched included Clostridium spp., one of which was C. perfringens, Enterococcus, Shigella and Escherichia coli. CONCLUSIONS: Protein fermentation by human faecal bacteria in the absence of sugars not only leads to the formation of hazardous metabolic products, but also to the possible proliferation of harmful bacteria. The kinetics of protein metabolism were similar to the rumen, but HAP bacteria were not found.
TI  - Clinicobiochemical investigations of gangrenous mastitis in does: immunological responses and oxidative stress biomarkers.
AB  - A total of 50 does were used to determine selected hematological and biochemical  parameters with special references to oxidative stress markers, acute phase protein profiles, and proinflammatory cytokines in healthy and gangrenous mastitis affected does. Animals were divided into two equal groups represented as clinically healthy (control) and diseased groups, respectively. The bacteriological examination of milk samples from diseased does revealed many types of bacterial infection. The isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (N=23/25), Escherichia coli (N=11/25), and Clostridium perfringens (N=4/25). There was a significant increase in the levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified free fatty acids, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase and a significant reduction in the levels of glucose, cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in does with gangrenous mastitis compared to healthy does. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde and uric acid with a significant decrease in the levels of reduced glutathione, super oxide dismutase, and catalase in does with gangrenous mastitis compared to healthy does. In addition, there was a significant increase in the haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in does with gangrenous mastitis compared to healthy ones. Conclusively, oxidative stress biomarkers, acute phase proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines play an essential task as biomarkers for gangrenous mastitis in does. Mastitis may be considered as one of the ketotic stressors in does after parturition.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriophages virulent for Clostridium perfringens and identification of phage lytic enzymes as alternatives to antibiotics for potential control of the bacterium.
AB  - There has been a resurgent interest in the use of bacteriophages or their gene products to control bacterial pathogens as alternatives to currently used antibiotics. Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that plays a significant role in human foodborne disease as well as non-foodborne human, animal, and avian diseases. Countries that have complied with the ban on antimicrobial growth promoters in feeds have reported increased incidences of C. perfringens-associated diseases in poultry. To address these issues, new antimicrobial agents, putative lysins encoded by the genomes of bacteriophages, are being identified in our laboratory. Poultry intestinal material, soil, sewage, and poultry processing drainage water were screened for virulent bacteriophages that could lyse C. perfringens and produce clear plaques in spot assays. Bacteriophages were isolated that had long noncontractile tails, members of the family Siphoviridae, and with short noncontractile tails, members of the family Podoviridae. Several bacteriophage genes were identified that encoded N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, lysozyme-endopeptidases, and a zinc carboxypeptidase domain that has not been previously reported in viral genomes. Putative phage lysin genes (ply) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant lysins were amidases capable of lysing both parental phage host strains of C. perfringens as well as other strains of the bacterium in spot and turbidity reduction assays, but did not lyse any clostridia beyond the species. Consequently, bacteriophage gene products could eventually be used to target bacterial pathogens, such as C. perfringens via a species-specific strategy, to control animal and human diseases without having deleterious effects on beneficial probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Application of a real-time PCR method for Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens detection in water samples.
AB  - The diagnostic assessment of water sanitary state is based mainly on the cultivation of bacteria retained on membrane filters. However classical microbiology methods have a lot of disadvantages. More and more frequently, rapid detection and identification of pathogens present in water is based on molecular biology techniques. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and usefulness of a real-time PCR method, when compared to the recommended bacteria culture method, in diagnostics of pathogens in water samples. The research concerned the detection and identification of main sanitary indicators of water such as: Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. The analyses were conducted in water samples contaminated with the reference material (the aforementioned bacteria) and real environmental samples, which were examined for the presence of nucleic acid of: Salmonella spp., E. coli, S. aureus and C. perfringens using a real-time PCR method.
TI  - Contributions of speed and accuracy to translational selection in bacteria.
AB  - Among bacteria, we have previously shown that species that are capable of rapid growth have stronger selection on codon usage than slow growing species, and possess higher numbers of rRNA and tRNA genes. This suggests that fast-growers are adapted for fast protein synthesis. There is also considerable evidence that codon usage is influenced by accuracy of translation, and some authors have argued that accuracy is more important than speed. Here we compare the strength of the two effects by studying the codon usages in high and low expression genes and on conserved and variable sites within high expression genes. We introduce a simple statistical method that can be used to assess the significance and the strength of the two types of bias in the same sets of sequences. We compare our statistical measure of codon bias to the common used codon adaptation index, and show that the new measure is preferable for three reasons for the purposes of this analysis. Across a large sample of bacterial genomes, both effects from speed and accuracy are clearly visible, although the speed effect appears to be much stronger than the accuracy effect and is found to be significant in a larger proportion of genomes. It is also difficult to explain the correlation of codon bias in the high expression genes with growth rates and numbers of copies of tRNA and rRNA genes on the basis of selection for accuracy. Hence we conclude that selection for translational speed is a dominant effect in driving codon usage bias in fast-growing bacteria, with selection for accuracy playing a small supplementary role.
TI  - Fate of pathogen indicators in a domestic blend of food waste and wastewater through a two-stage anaerobic digestion system.
AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a viable on-site treatment technology for rich organic waste streams such as food waste and blackwater. In contrast to large-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants which are typically located away from the community, the effluent from any type of on-site system is a potential pathogenic hazard because of the intimacy of the system to the community. The native concentrations of the pathogen indicators Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and somatic coliphage were tracked for 30 days under stable operation (organic loading rate (OLR) = 1.8 kgCOD m(-3) day(-1), methane yield = 52% on a chemical oxygen demand (COD) basis) of a two-stage laboratory-scale digester treating a mixture of food waste and blackwater. E. coli numbers were reduced by a factor of 10(6.4) in the thermophilic stage, from 10(7.5+/-0.3) to 10(1.1+/-0.1) cfu 100 mL(-1), but regenerated by a factor of 10(4) in the mesophilic stage. Neither the thermophilic nor mesophilic stages had any significant impact on C. perfringens concentrations. Coliphage concentrations were reduced by a factor of 10(1.4) across the two stages. The study shows that anaerobic digestion only reduces pathogen counts marginally but that counts in effluent samples could be readily reduced to below detection limits by filtration through a 0.22 microm membrane, to investigate membrane filtration as a possible sanitation technique.
TI  - Cytokine response of human mononuclear cells induced by intestinal Clostridium species.
AB  - Altered composition of intestinal microbiota has been associated with various immunological disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Although Clostridium species are major inhabitants of the intestinal tract, their interaction with the host immunological system is yet poorly characterized. In this study, cytokine responses of human monocytic cell line THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to six type strains representing common intestinal clostridial species were determined. The strains induced diverse cytokine responses in both THP-1 cells and PBMC. Clostridium perfringens was the most potent inducer of both tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), as compared to Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Clostridium leptum, Clostridium sporosphaeroides and Blautia coccoides. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in PBMC was most efficiently stimulated by C. sporosphaeroides. The same PBMC preparations that responded strongly to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also responded strongly to bacterial stimulation. This indicates that the level of responsiveness is an individual feature of mononuclear cell preparations, and that the overall cytokine response is composed by a combination of host factors and microbial structures affecting them. This work supports the idea that the composition of the intestinal clostridial population influences immune responses and is likely to play an important role in intestinal homeostasis.
TI  - The effect of poultry manure application rate and AlCl(3) treatment on bacterial  fecal indicators in runoff.
AB  - Increasing costs associated with inorganic fertilizer have led to widespread use  of broiler litter. Proper land application, typically limiting nutrient loss, is essential to protect surface water. This study was designed to evaluate litter-borne microbial runoff (heterotrophic plate count bacteria, staphylococci, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens) while applying typical nutrient-control methods. Field studies were conducted in which plots with high and low litter rates, inorganic fertilizer, AlCl(3)-treated litter, and controls were rained on five times using a rain generator. Overall, microbial runoff from poultry litter applied plots was consistently greater (2-5 log(10) plot(-1)) than controls. No appreciable effect on microbial runoff was noted from variable litter application rate or AlCl(3) treatments, though rain event, not time, significantly affected runoff load. C. perfringens and staphylococci runoff were consistently associated with poultry litter application, during early rain events, while other indicators were unreliable. Large microbial runoff pulses were observed, ranging from 10(2) to 10(10) CFU plot(-1); however, only a small fraction of litter-borne microbes were recoverable in runoff. This study indicated that microbial runoff from litter-applied plots can be substantial, and that methods intended to reduce nutrient losses do not necessarily reduce microbial runoff.
TI  - Diversity of Salmonella spp. serovars isolated from the intestines of water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salmonellosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves is a widespread disease characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions, profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration, occasionally exhibiting a systemic course. Several Salmonella serovars seem to be able to infect water buffalo, but Salmonella isolates collected from this animal species have been poorly characterized. In the present study, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis was assessed, and a polyphasic characterization of isolated strains of S. Typhimurium was performed. RESULTS: The microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents obtained from 248 water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis exhibited a significant prevalence of Salmonella spp. (25%), characterized by different serovars, most frequently Typhimurium (21%), Muenster (11%), and Give (11%). The 13 S. Typhimurium isolates were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of the intestine, and only sporadically isolated with another possible causative agent responsible for gastroenteritis, such as Cryptosporidium spp., Rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens. Other Salmonella isolates were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions, and often (78% of cases) isolated with other microorganisms, mainly toxinogenic Escherichia coli (35%), Cryptosporidium spp. (20%) and Rotavirus (10%). The S. Typhimurium strains were characterized by phage typing and further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of 24 virulence genes. The isolates exhibited nine different phage types and 10 different genetic profiles. Three monophasic S. Typhimurium (B:4,12:i:-) isolates were also found and characterized, displaying three different phage types and three different virulotypes. The molecular characterization was extended to the 7 S. Muenster and 7 S. Give isolates collected, indicating the existence of different virulotypes also within these serovars. Three representative strains of S. Typhimurium were tested in vivo in a mouse model of mixed infection. The most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence factors and the presence of the locus agfA, coding for a thin aggregative fimbria. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that Salmonella is frequently associated with gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves, particularly S. Typhimurium. Moreover, the variety in the number and distribution of different virulence markers among the collected S. Typhimurium strains suggests that within this serovar there are different pathotypes potentially responsible for different clinical syndromes.
TI  - Postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - The distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in Cote d'Ivoire, and their roles in the food poisoning were evaluated. Microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus spores, fungi and Clostridium perfringens. The results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged, respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter amnigenus, Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Thamnidium spp., Fusarium spp., Moniliella spp. the fungi. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not found. The occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in Cote d'Ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system during the production. Attieke is especially a well-known product in West Africa; hence, it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. Overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.
TI  - Recovery of diverse microbes in high turbidity surface water samples using dead-end ultrafiltration.
AB  - Dead-end ultrafiltration (DEUF) has been reported to be a simple, field-deployable technique for recovering bacteria, viruses, and parasites from large-volume water samples for water quality testing and waterborne disease investigations. While DEUF has been reported for application to water samples having relatively low turbidity, little information is available regarding recovery efficiencies for this technique when applied to sampling turbid water samples such as those commonly found in lakes and rivers. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a DEUF technique for recovering MS2 bacteriophage, enterococci, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in surface water samples having elevated turbidity. Average recovery efficiencies for each study microbe across all turbidity ranges were: MS2 (66%), C. parvum (49%), enterococci (85%), E. coli (81%), and C. perfringens (63%). The recovery efficiencies for MS2 and C. perfringens exhibited an inversely proportional relationship with turbidity, however no significant differences in recovery were observed for C. parvum, enterococci, or E. coli. Although ultrafilter clogging was observed, the DEUF method was able to process 100-L surface water samples at each turbidity level within 60 min. This study supports the use of the DEUF method for recovering a wide array of microbes in large-volume surface water samples having medium to high turbidity.
TI  - The principal fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk exhibit prebiotic properties on cultured infant microbiota.
AB  - Breast-fed infant microbiota is typically rich in bifidobacteria. Herein, major human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are assessed for their ability to promote the growth of bifidobacteria and to acidify their environment, key features of prebiotics. During in vitro anaerobic fermentation of infant microbiota, supplementation by HMOS significantly decreased the pH even greater than supplementation by fructooligosaccharide (FOS), a prebiotic positive control. HMOS elevated lactate concentrations, increased the proportion of Bifidobacterium spp. in culture, and through their fermentation into organic acids, decreased the proportion of Escherichia and Clostridium perfringens. Three principal components of HMOS, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose and 3-fucosyllactose, were consumed in these cultures. These three principal oligosaccharides of human milk were then individually tested as supplements for in vitro growth of four individual representative strains of infant gut microbes. Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007 and B. longum ATCC15697 efficiently consumed oligosaccharides and produced abundant lactate and short-chain fatty acids, resulting in significant pH reduction. The specificity of fermentation differed by microbe species and strain and by oligosaccharide structure. Escherichia coli K12 and C. perfringens did not utilize appreciable fucosylated oligosaccharides, and a typical mixture of organic acid fermentation products inhibited their growth. In summary, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose, and 3-fucosyllactose, when cultured with B. longum JCM7007 and B. longum ATCC15697, exhibit key characteristics of a prebiotic in vitro. If these bifidobacteria are representative of pioneering or keystone species for human microbiota, fucosylated HMOS could strongly promote colonization and maintenance of a mutualist symbiotic microbiome. Thus, these simple glycans could mediate beneficial effects of human milk on infant health.
TI  - Novel system for efficient isolation of Clostridium double-crossover allelic exchange mutants enabling markerless chromosomal gene deletions and DNA integration.
AB  - Isolation of Clostridium mutants based on gene replacement via allelic exchange remains a major limitation for this important genus. Use of a heterologous counterselection marker can facilitate the identification of the generally rare allelic exchange events. We report on the development of an inducible counterselection marker and describe its utility and broad potential in quickly and efficiently generating markerless DNA deletions and integrations at any genomic locus without the need for auxotrophic mutants or the use of the mobile group II introns. This system is based on a codon-optimized mazF toxin gene from Escherichia coli under the control of a lactose-inducible promoter from Clostridium perfringens. This system is potentially applicable to almost all members of the genus Clostridium due to their similarly low genomic GC content and comparable codon usage. We isolated all allelic-exchange-based gene deletions (ca_p0167, sigF, and sigK) or disruptions (ca_p0157 and sigF) we attempted and integrated a 3.6-kb heterologous DNA sequence (made up of a Clostridium ljungdahlii 2.1-kb formate dehydrogenase [fdh] gene plus a FLP recombination target [FRT]-flanked thiamphenicol resistance marker) into the Clostridium acetobutylicum chromosome. Furthermore, we report on the development of a plasmid system with inducible segregational instability, thus enabling efficient deployment of the FLP-FRT system to generate markerless deletion or integration mutants. This enabled expeditious deletion of the thiamphenicol resistance marker from the fdh integrant strain as well as the sigK deletion strain. More generally, our system can potentially be applied to other organisms with underdeveloped genetic tools.
TI  - Ranking the disease burden of 14 pathogens in food sources in the United States using attribution data from outbreak investigations and expert elicitation.
AB  - Understanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards  across the food supply is critical for a risk-based national food safety system. This study was conducted to estimate the U.S. health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then rank the resulting 168 pathogen-food combinations. These pathogens examined were Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, Salmonella enterica, Toxoplasma gondii, and all other FoodNet pathogens. The health burden associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of the cost of illness and loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from acute and chronic illness and mortality. A new method for attributing illness to foods was developed that relies on both outbreak data and expert elicitation. This method assumes that empirical data are generally preferable to expert judgment; thus, outbreak data were used for attribution except where evidence suggests that these data are considered not representative of food attribution. Based on evaluation of outbreak data, expert elicitation, and published scientific literature, outbreak-based attribution estimates for Campylobacter, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, and Yersinia were determined not representative; therefore, expert-based attribution were included for these four pathogens. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of attribution data assumptions on rankings. Disease burden was concentrated among a relatively small number of pathogen-food combinations. The top 10 pairs were responsible for losses of over $8 billion and 36,000 QALYs, or more than 50 % of the total across all pairs. Across all 14 pathogens, poultry, pork, produce, and complex foods were responsible for nearly 60 % of the total cost of illness and loss of QALYs.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Opportunistic pathogens and faecal indicators in drinking water associated biofilms in Cluj, Romania.
AB  - Biofouling occurs without exception in all water systems, with undesirable effects such as biocorrosion and deterioration of water quality. Drinking water associated biofilms represent a potential risk to human health by harbouring pathogenic or toxin-releasing microorganisms. This is the first study investigating the attached microbiota, with potential threat to human health, in a public water system in Romania. The presence and the seasonal variation of viable faecal indicators and opportunistic pathogens were investigated within naturally developed biofilms in a drinking water treatment plant. Bacterial frequencies were correlated with microbial loads in biofilms as well as with physical and chemical characteristics of biofilms and raw water. The biofilms assessed in the current study proved to be extremely active microbial consortia. High bacterial numbers were recovered by cultivation, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. There were no Legionella spp. detected in any biofilm sample. Emergence of opportunistic pathogens in biofilms was not significantly affected by the surface material, but by the treatment process. Implementation of a water safety plan encompassing measures to prevent microbial contamination and to control biofouling would be appropriate.
TI  - Microbiological quality and potential public health risks of export meat from springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) in Namibia.
AB  - To assess the microbiological quality and safety of export game meat; i) a total  of 80 pooled meat samples for aerobic plate count (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae ii) water used in harvesting and processing for microbiological quality and iii) meat and rectal contents for Salmonella spp. and Shiga toxin Escherichia coli (STEC) were evaluated in 2009 and 2010. No differences (p>0.05) in the APCs were observed between the years, but the mean Enterobacteriaceae count for 2009 was 1.33 +/- 0.69 log(10)cfu/cm(2) compared to 2.93 +/- 1.50 log(10)cfu/cm(2) for 2010. Insignificant Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) levels were detected in 9/23 field water samples, while fecal bacterial (coliforms, Clostridium perfringens and enterococci) were absent in all samples. No Salmonella spp. was isolated and all E. coli isolates from meat were negative for STEC virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae and hlyA), suggesting a negligible role by springbok in the epidemiology of STEC and Salmonella.
TI  - Garlic derivative propyl propane thiosulfonate is effective against broiler enteropathogens in vivo.
AB  - Two experiments were carried out to study the effects of dietary supplementation  with the garlic (Allium sativum)-derived product propyl propane thiosulfonate (PTS-O) on the intestinal log(10) number of copies of enteropathogens in broiler chickens, together with their intestinal morphology and growth performance. The additive had no significant effect on feed intake at any dose assayed. In experiment 1 (1 to 21 d of age), the BW of chickens fed on 45 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet was higher (P < 0.01) than that of controls. Birds fed on diets containing 45 and 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet had improved (P < 0.01) feed:gain ratios compared with the controls at 21 d of age. Ileal villus height, width and surface area, mucosal thickness, and muscular layer thickness were considerably greater (P < 0.01) than control values in chickens fed 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet. The Clostridium perfringens log(10) number of counts was not significantly affected at any dose assayed. The inclusion of PTS-O at both concentrations (45 and 90 mg/kg of diet) resulted in lower (P < 0.01) log(10) number of copies of ileal Salmonella spp. and crop enterobacteria and Escherichia coli. The inclusion of 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet also resulted in lower (P < 0.01) enterobacteria and E. coli log(10) numbers of copies in the ileal and cecal contents, respectively. The number of copies of Campylobacter jejuni was not significantly affected. In experiment 2 (15 to 28 d of age), lower (P < 0.01) log(10) number of copies of Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni were determined in the ileal contents of chickens fed on diets containing 135 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet. The addition of 90 mg of PTS-O/kg of diet lowered (P < 0.01) only the number of copies of ileal Salmonella spp. This investigation confirmed previous in vitro data and showed that PTS-O lowered the intestinal numbers of enteropathogens and improved the ileal histological structure and productive parameters of broilers.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of pathogenic bacteria from hospitalized trauma patients who survived Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. Most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory tract (37.1%) sites were identified. A total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. Of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were Gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens. The distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the same time. The most prevalent pathogenic isolates were Escherichia coli (15.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), Burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and Enterococcus spp. (9.3%). The drug susceptibility results showed that most of the Gram-negative bacilli, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. Most of the Gram-positive cocci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and Synercid/dalfopristin. Characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.
TI  - Sensitivity of pathogenic and commensal bacteria from the human colon to essential oils.
AB  - The microbiota of the intestinal tract plays an important role in colonic health, mediating many effects of dietary components on colonic health and during enteric infections. In the context of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria, complementary therapies are required for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections. Here we report the potential application of essential oils (EO) and pure EO compounds to improve human gut health. Nerolidol, thymol, eugenol and geraniol inhibited growth of the pathogens Escherichia coli O157 : H7(VT(-)), Clostridium difficile DSM1296, Clostridium perfringens DSM11780, Salmonella typhimurium 3530 and Salmonella enteritidis S1400 at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) varying from 50 to 500 p.p.m. Most EO showed greater toxicity to pathogens than to commensals. However, the beneficial commensal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sensitive to EO at similar or even lower concentrations than the pathogens. The EO showed dose-dependent effects on cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, of Gram-positive bacteria. These effects were not strongly correlated with growth inhibition, however, suggesting that cell membrane damage occurred but was not the primary cause of growth inhibition. Growth inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria, in contrast, occurred mostly without cell integrity loss. Principal component analysis showed clustering of responses according to bacterial species rather than to the identity of the EO, with the exception that responses to thymol and nerolidol clustered away from the other EO. In conclusion, the selective effects of some EO might have beneficial effects on gut health if chosen carefully for effectiveness against different species.
TI  - Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - Consumption of foods containing Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. Given the fact that over the past decade, Canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA on foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada. Between January 2007 and December 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). These foods were screened for: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, S. aureus, Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella spp., and Yersinia spp. S. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. The S. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. Methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. These findings indicate that the presence of S. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although MRSA was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.
TI  - Several enteropathogens are circulating in suckling and newly weaned piglets suffering from diarrhea in the province of Villa Clara, Cuba.
AB  - Intestinal contents of suckling (n = 45) and newly weaned (n = 45) piglets, suffering from diarrhea in the province of Villa Clara in Cuba, were tested for viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteropathogens from May to June 2008. At least one enteropathogen was identified in 53.3 % of piglets and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC; 25.6 %) was the major pathogen; mostly STa(+)/STb(+) or F4(+)/STa(+)/STb(+) ETEC were isolated. The overall occurrence of the rest of pathogens was 10 % for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and Cryptosporidium parvum, 6.7 % for rotavirus A and Isospora suis, 5.6 % for alpha-toxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 3.3 % for verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC), and 2.2 % for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Newport. TGEV and alpha-toxigenic C. perfringens were only identified in suckling piglets, while Salmonella Newport and VTEC were only detected in weaned pigs. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), beta-toxigenic C. perfringens, Eimeria spp., and helminths were not identified. Eight kinds of mixed infections were detected in 25 % of enteropathogen positive piglets. ETEC was present in 10 of 12 mixed infections, and TGEV infections were never combined. This survey demonstrates that several enteropathogens are circulating in piggeries located in the province of Villa Clara in Cuba, and that is necessary to improve surveillance, prevention, and control of enteric infections in order to increase production efficiency.
TI  - Temporal flux and spatial dynamics of nutrients, fecal indicators, and zoonotic pathogens in anaerobic swine manure lagoon water.
AB  - Confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) often use anaerobic lagoons for manure treatment. In the USA, swine CAFO lagoon water is used for crop irrigation that is regulated by farm-specific nutrient management plans (NMPs). Implementation of stricter US environmental regulations in 2013 will set soil P limits; impacting land applications of manure and requiring revision of NMPs. Precise knowledge of lagoon water quality is needed for formulating NMPs, for understanding losses of N and C in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions, and for understanding risks of environmental contamination by fecal bacteria, including zoonotic pathogens. In this study we determined year-round levels of nutrients and bacteria from swine CAFO lagoon water. Statistical analysis of data for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), inorganic and organic C, total N, water-soluble and total minerals (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, and Zn) and bacteria (Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., and staphylococci) showed that all differed significantly by dates of collection. During the irrigation season, levels of total N decreased by half and the N:P ratio changed from 9.7 to 2.8. Some seasonal differences were correlated with temperature. Total N and inorganic C increased below 19 degrees C, and decreased above 19 degrees C, consistent with summer increases in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions. Water-soluble Cu, Fe, and Zn increased with higher summer temperatures while enterococci and zoonotic pathogens (Campylobacter, Listeria, and Salmonella) decreased. Although their populations changed seasonally, the zoonotic pathogens were present year-round. Increasing levels of E. coli were statistically correlated with increasing pH. Differences between depths were also found. Organic C, total nutrients (C, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, N, P, and Zn) and C. perfringens were higher in deeper samples, indicating stratification of these parameters. No statistical interactions were found between collection dates and depths.
TI  - Treatment of bran containing bread by baking enzymes; effect on the growth of probiotic bacteria on soluble dietary fiber extract in vitro.
AB  - Different ways of treating bran by baking enzymes prior to dough making and the baking process were used to increase the amount of water-soluble dietary fiber (DF) in wheat bread with added bran. Soluble DF was extracted from the bread with water and separated from the digestible material with gastrointestinal tract enzymes and by solvent precipitation. The baking enzyme mixtures tested (xylanase and glucanase/cellulase, with and without lipase) increased the amounts of soluble arabinoxylan and protein resistant to digestion. The isolated fiber was used as a growth substrate for 11 probiotic and intestinal Bifidobacterium strains, for commensal strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli, and for potential intestinal pathogenic strains of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Clostridium perfringens. Fermentation analyses indicated that the tested strains had varying capacity to grow in the presence of the extracted fiber. Of the tested probiotic strains B. longum species generally showed the highest ability to utilize the fiber extracts, although the potential pathogens tested also showed an ability to grow on these fiber extracts. In sum, the enzymes used to improve the baking process for high-fiber bread can also be used to produce in situ soluble fiber material, which in turn can exert prebiotic effects on certain potentially beneficial microbes.
TI  - Performance of enviss stormwater filters: results of a laboratory trial.
AB  - An experimental study was undertaken by Monash University to develop and test enviss stormwater treatment and harvesting technologies - non-vegetated filtration systems with an extremely low footprint. This paper focuses on the water quality and hydraulic performance of two systems tested over a 'year' of operation in a Melbourne climate: (1) REUSE enviss filters, designed for stormwater harvesting systems for non-potable supply substitution, and (2) WSUD enviss filters, developed to treat urban stormwater prior to discharge to downstream systems. The presence of chlorine as a disinfection agent proved to be very efficient for the removal of microorganisms in REUSE enviss filters. WSUD enviss filters had the benefit of providing an elevated nutrient treatment performance, due to an extended depth of filter media. However, nutrient outflow concentrations (total nitrogen (TN) in particular) were found to increase during the testing period. Also, extended dry weather periods were found to have a detrimental effect on the treatment performance of almost all pollutants for both filters (nutrients, Escherichia coli and heavy metals). Although hydraulic conductivity results indicated two or three sediment trap replacements per year are required to maintain filtration rates, it is expected that the compressed loading rate schedule overestimated this maintenance frequency.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0174-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
TI  - Sanitary inspection of wells using risk-of-contamination scoring indicates a high predictive ability for bacterial faecal pollution in the peri-urban tropical lowlands of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
AB  - Sanitary inspection of wells was performed according to World Health Organization (WHO) procedures using risk-of-contamination (ROC) scoring in the peri-urban tropical lowlands of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The ROC was assessed for its capacity to predict bacterial faecal pollution in the investigated well water. The analysis was based on a selection of wells representing environments with low to high presumptive faecal pollution risk and a multi-parametric data set of bacterial indicators, generating a comprehensive picture of the level and characteristics of faecal pollution (such as vegetative Escherichia coli cells, Clostridium perfringens spores and human-associated sorbitol fermenting Bifidobacteria). ROC scoring demonstrated a remarkable ability to predict bacterial faecal pollution levels in the investigated well water (e.g. 87% of E. coli concentration variations were predicted by ROC scoring). Physicochemical characteristics of the wells were not reflected by the ROC scores. Our results indicate that ROC scoring is a useful tool for supporting health-related well water management in urban and suburban areas of tropical, developing countries. The outcome of this study is discussed in the context of previously published results, and future directions are suggested.
TI  - Requirement of upstream Hfq-binding (ARN)x elements in glmS and the Hfq C-terminal region for GlmS upregulation by sRNAs GlmZ and GlmY.
AB  - Hfq is an important RNA-binding protein that helps bacteria adapt to stress. Its  primary function is to promote pairing between trans-acting small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) and their target mRNAs. Identification of essential Hfq-binding motifs in up-stream regions of rpoS and fhlA led us to ask the question whether these elements are a common occurrence among other Hfq-dependent mRNAs as well. Here, we confirm the presence of a similar (ARN)(x) motif in glmS RNA, a gene controlled by two sRNAs (GlmZ and GlmY) in an Hfq-dependent manner. GlmZ represents a canonical sRNA:mRNA pairing system, whereas GlmY is non-canonical, interfacing with the RNA processing protein YhbJ. We show that glmS interacts with both Hfq-binding surfaces in the absence of sRNAs. Even though two (ARN)(x) motifs are present, using a glmS:gfp fusion system, we determined that only one specific (ARN)(x) element is essential for regulation. Furthermore, we show that residues 66-72 in the C-terminal extension of Escherichia coli Hfq are essential for activation of GlmS expression by GlmY, but not with GlmZ. This result shows that the C-terminal extension of Hfq may be required for some forms of non-canonical sRNA regulation involving ancillary components such as additional RNAs or proteins.
TI  - Evaluation of impact of exposure of Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. In this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on 11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. Among the tested bacteria, cell growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red, respectively. At the tested concentration of 100 muM, Sudan I and II inhibited growth of Clostridium perfringens and Lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. Sudan II also affected growth of Enterococcus faecalis. Growth of Bifidobacterium catenulatum, C. perfringens, E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by Sudan III and IV with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. C. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by Para Red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-Amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. However, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. The dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. Clostridium indolis and Clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of Sudan azo dyes. The present results suggested that Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.
TI  - Longitudinal study of Clostridium difficile and antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli in healthy horses in a community setting.
AB  - Point prevalence studies have reported carriage rates of enteric pathogens in healthy horses, but longitudinal data are lacking. Commensal E. coli is an indicator organism to evaluate antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria, yet there are limited data for horses. The objectives of this study were to investigate and molecularly characterize isolates of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella, collected sequentially over a one year period, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile for E. coli. Fecal samples were collected monthly from 25 adult horses for one year. Selective cultures were performed for all above bacteria. C. difficile isolates were characterized via PCR toxin gene profiling and ribotyping. Broth microdilution was performed to assess antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of E. coli. Toxigenic Clostridium difficile was isolated from 15/275 (5.45%) samples from 10/25 (40%) horses. Four horses were positive at multiple sampling times but different ribotypes were found in three. Ribotypes included 078 (n=6), 001 (n=6) and C (n=3). C. perfringens was not isolated, nor was Salmonella. E. coli was isolated from 232/300 (77%) fecal samples. Resistance to >/= 1 and >/= 3 antimicrobials was present in 31/232 (13.4%) and 6/232 (2.6%) respectively. Only two horses shed the same strain of toxigenic C. difficile for more than one month, indicating that shedding is transient. The high number of ribotype 078 is consistent with recent emergence of this strain in the local horse population. The low prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal E. coli suggests that healthy horses are not likely a major reservoir of resistance for enteric bacteria.
TI  - Clostridium difficile MazF toxin exhibits selective, not global, mRNA cleavage.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an important, emerging nosocomial pathogen. The transition from harmless colonization to disease is typically preceded by antimicrobial therapy, which alters the balance of the intestinal flora, enabling C. difficile to proliferate in the colon. One of the most perplexing aspects of the C. difficile infectious cycle is its ability to survive antimicrobial therapy and transition from inert colonization to active infection. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been implicated in facilitating persistence after antibiotic treatment. We identified only one TA system in C. difficile strain 630 (epidemic type X), designated MazE-cd and MazF-cd, a counterpart of the well-characterized Escherichia coli MazEF TA system. This E. coli MazF toxin cleaves mRNA at ACA sequences, leading to global mRNA degradation, growth arrest, and death. Likewise, MazF-cd expression in E. coli or Clostridium perfringens resulted in growth arrest. Primer extension analysis revealed that MazF-cd cleaved RNA at the five-base consensus sequence UACAU, suggesting that the mRNAs susceptible to cleavage comprise a subset of total mRNAs. In agreement, we observed differential cleavage of several mRNAs by MazF-cd in vivo, revealing a direct correlation between the number of cleavage recognition sites within a given transcript and its susceptibility to degradation by MazF-cd. Interestingly, upon detailed statistical analyses of the C. difficile transcriptome, the major C. difficile virulence factor toxin B (TcdB) and CwpV, a cell wall protein involved in aggregation, were predicted to be significantly resistant to MazF-cd cleavage.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of tile drainage water and shallow groundwater under different application methods of liquid swine manure.
AB  - A 2 year field experiment evaluated liquid manure application methods on the movement of manure-borne pathogens (Salmonella sp.) and indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens) to subsurface water. A combination of application methods including surface application, pre-application tillage, and post-application incorporation were applied in a randomized complete block design on an instrumented field site in spring 2007 and 2008. Tile and shallow groundwater were sampled immediately after manure application and after rainfall events. Bacterial enumeration from water samples showed that the surface-applied manure resulted in the highest concentration of E. coli in tile drainage water. Pre-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the movement of manure-based E. coli and C. perfringens to tile water and to shallow groundwater within 3 days after manure application (DAM) in 2008 and within 10 DAM in 2007. Pre-tillage also decreased the occurrence of Salmonella sp. in tile water samples. Indicator bacteria and pathogens reached nondetectable levels within 50 DAM. The results suggest that tillage before application of liquid swine manure can minimize the movement of bacteria to tile and groundwater, but is effective only for the drainage events immediately after manure application or initial rainfall-associated drainage flows. Furthermore, the study highlights the strong association between bacterial concentrations in subsurface waters and rainfall timing and volume after manure application.
TI  - Immunohistochemical search for viral and bacterial antigens in Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that diseased intestinal tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) contain obstructed lymphatics, granulomas, and tertiary lymphoid organs, representing responses to persistent antigen. METHODS: Forty-seven tissue sections from 28 CD patients and 20 tissue sections from 17 control patients were studied. Tissues were immunostained with antibody directed against adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus I, parvovirus B19, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. RESULTS: There was no evidence of adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, or M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in the tissues. Clostridia were positively stained in the mucus of 18.5% of CD patients versus 35.3% of controls and in the tissue of 11.1% of CD patients but in no controls. Immunoreactivity to listeria antibody occurred in the mucus of 3.7% of CD patients and in 5.9% of controls while it occurred in the tissue of 37.0% of CD patients and 29.4% of controls. E. coli occurred in the mucus of 48.1% CD and 64.7% controls and in the tissue of 18.5% and 5.9% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Of the agents demonstrated in this search, none was located in granulomas or inflamed lymphatics. Finding the common gut microbes, E. coli and clostridia, in the mucus of patients and controls was not unexpected. The minor focal staining of E. coli and clostridia does not suggest a primary role for these pathogens in CD. Positive staining for listeria in patients and controls may very well represent cross reactivity rather than specific identification.
TI  - A case of emphysematous hepatitis with spontaneous pneumoperitoneum in a patient  with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
AB  - An 80-year-old woman with hilar cholangiocarcinoma was hospitalized due to sudden-onset abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed hepatic necrosis accompanied with emphysematous change in the superior segment of the right liver (S7/S8), implying spontaneous rupture, based on the presence of perihepatic free air. Although urgent percutaneous drainage was performed, neither pus nor fluids were drained. These findings suggest emphysematous hepatitis with a hepatic mass. Despite the application of intensive care, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and she died 3 days after admission to hospital. Liver gas has been reported in some clinical diseases (e.g., liver abscess) to be caused by gas-forming organisms; however, emphysematous hepatitis simulating emphysematous pyelonephritis is very rare. The case reported here was of fatal emphysematous hepatitis in a patient with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
TI  - Foodborne outbreaks surveillance in the Piedmont Region, Italy (2002-2009).
AB  - BACKGROUND: this article summarises the results of eight years (2002-2009) of investigations on food borne disease outbreaks carried out the Regional Agency for Public Health in Piedmont, which is an Italian Region (4,432,571 citizens, 2008). METHODS: the investigations were conducted as cohort studies supported by laboratory analysis of: food and patients. The data were reported by general practitioners and hospital physicians, and were collected, evaluated and recorded in 22 Hospitals. RESULTS: it recorded 803 outbreaks of food borne disease, of which 177 mushroom outbreaks with 318 ill people and 499 outbreaks for all the others agents with 3,381 ill people. The maximum prevalence was 15.7/100,000 (2004). The most important causes for numbers of ill people have been (2002-2009): salmonellosis (34%, 1,250/3,699), mushroom poisoning (9%, 318/3,699), Escherichia coli (8%, 228/3,699), Staphyilococcus (6%, 209/3,699), virus (5%, 198/3,699), Clostridium perfringens (4%, 154/3,699), Bacillus cereus (2.1%, 76/3,699), scombrotoxin (1.8%, 65/3,699). 303 out of 304 mushrooms outbreaks occurred from consumers that picking mushrooms themselves to eat in private homes and for all others agents: 57% of 499 the outbreaks occurred in private homes, 27% in restaurants, 6% in canteens, but 39% of 3,381 ill people had eaten in restaurants and other public food facilities, 32% in private homes and 24% in canteens. After mushrooms the eggs (75 outbreaks) were the most important food recognized. CONCLUSION: the theoretical maximum prevalence which can be hypothesized with this data in Piedmont (2002-2009) is 141/100,000 (sum of the maximum prevalence recorded at least in one Piedmont Hospital district).
TI  - Responses of feeding prebiotics on nutrient digestibility, faecal microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in dogs: a meta-analysis.
AB  - The effects of prebiotics on digestibility, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations and bacterial populations in the faeces and immunity in dogs were evaluated by meta-analyses. Overall, data from 15 published studies containing 65 different treatment means of 418 observations from different breeds of dogs were included in the data set. Feeding of prebiotics to dogs did not affect the nutrient intake (P > 0.10), nor did prebiotics change (P > 0.10) the digestibility of dry matter (DM) and fat. However, crude protein (CP) digestibility tended to decrease quadratically (P = 0.06) with increasing dosages of prebiotics, although the degree of prediction was low (R(2) = 0.33). The concentration of total SCFA (P = 0.08; R(2) = 0.90) tended to increase linearly, whereas concentration of acetate (R(2) = 0.25), propionate (R(2) = 0.88) and butyrate (R(2) = 0.85) increased quadratically with increasing dosage of prebiotics in the faeces of dogs. The numbers of beneficial bifidobacteria (P < 0.01; R(2) = 0.62) increased quadratically, but lactobacilli (P < 0.01; R(2) = 0.66) increased linearly with increasing supplementation of prebiotics. The changes in healthy bacterial numbers were affected by the interaction of initial bacterial numbers and dose of prebiotics; bacterial numbers increased relatively more when initial bacterial numbers were low. Dietary composition did not influence the response of prebiotics on lactobacilli and bifidobacterial numbers in this study. The numbers of pathogenic Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli were not affected by prebiotics. Prebiotics did not affect the serum immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations such as IgG, IgA and IgM in dogs. Although prebiotics may tend to have an adverse effect on CP digestibility, prebiotics at doses up to 1.40% food intake (DM basis) might increase the beneficial bacterial populations and SCFA concentrations in the faeces of dogs. Thus, the feeding of prebiotics has a great prospective to improve the intestinal health of dogs.
TI  - Effect of temperature on microbial growth rate-mathematical analysis: the Arrhenius and Eyring-Polanyi connections.
AB  - The objective of this work is to develop a mathematical model for evaluating the  effect of temperature on the rate of microbial growth. The new mathematical model is derived by combination and modification of the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring-Polanyi transition theory. The new model, suitable for both suboptimal and the entire growth temperature ranges, was validated using a collection of 23 selected temperature-growth rate curves belonging to 5 groups of microorganisms, including Pseudomonas spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli, from the published literature. The curve fitting is accomplished by nonlinear regression using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The resulting estimated growth rate (mu) values are highly correlated to the data collected from the literature (R(2) = 0.985, slope = 1.0, intercept = 0.0). The bias factor (B(f) ) of the new model is very close to 1.0, while the accuracy factor (A(f) ) ranges from 1.0 to 1.22 for most data sets. The new model is compared favorably with the Ratkowsky square root model and the Eyring equation. Even with more parameters, the Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and mean square errors of the new model are not statistically different from the square root model and the Eyring equation, suggesting that the model can be used to describe the inherent relationship between temperature and microbial growth rates. The results of this work show that the new growth rate model is suitable for describing the effect of temperature on microbial growth rate. Practical Application: Temperature is one of the most significant factors affecting the growth of microorganisms in foods. This study attempts to develop and validate a mathematical model to describe the temperature dependence of microbial growth rate. The findings show that the new model is accurate and can be used to describe the effect of temperature on microbial growth rate in foods.
TI  - Bacteria and their toxins tamed for immunotherapy.
AB  - Bacterial toxins share the ability to enter host cells to target various intracellular proteins and to modulate host immune responses. Over the last 20 years, toxins and their mutated variants, as well as live attenuated bacteria, have been exploited for vaccination and immunotherapy of various infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases. The ability of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin to translocate its adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane, as well as the pathways of intracellular trafficking of Bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins, Shigella dysenteriae shiga toxin or Escherichia coli shiga-like toxin, have been repeatedly exploited for the delivery of antigenic epitopes into host cells and for stimulation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Similarly, E. coli alpha-hemolysin, or effector proteins of Yersinia and Salmonella secreted by the type III secretion systems, were used to facilitate the delivery of fused heterologous proteins or peptides for antigenic presentation. Vibrio cholerae cholera toxin, E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, B. pertussis pertussis toxin or the Cry1A protein of Bacillus thuringiensis have shown a great potential to act as adjuvants and to stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. The immunotherapeutic potential of some toxins, like Clostridium perfringens perfringolysin O, Streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin, or Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin needs to be evaluated further. The Bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid used as a vaccine delivery tool, or Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A-based immunotoxins, are currently in various phases of clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy, as are some antigen-delivering Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes strains.
TI  - Determining potential indicators of Cryptosporidium oocysts throughout the wastewater treatment process.
AB  - Most research on wastewater treatment efficiency compliance focuses on physicochemical and microbial indicators; however, very little emphasis has been placed so far on determining suitable indicator organisms to predict the discharge level of pathogens from treatment plants. In this study, raw wastewater, activated sludge, and the resulting final effluents and biosolids in four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs A, B, C and D) were seasonally investigated for human-virulent water-borne pathogens Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis and Giardia duodenalis, and microsporidia (e.g. Encephalitozoon hellem, E. intestinalis, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi) between 2008 and 2009. A suite of potential microbial indicators for human-virulent protozoa and microsporidia was also determined. A combination of multiple fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunofluorescent antibody assays were applied to detect Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, and microsporidian spores. Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens spores were cultivated in selective media. Positive correlations were found between the abundance of enterococci and E. coli and abundance of Cryptosporidium oocysts (r(s) > 0.47, p < 0.01) and Giardia cysts (r(s) > 0.44, p < 0.01) at WWTPs A-D. Cryptosporidium perfringens spores were positively correlated to Cryptosporidium oocysts (r(s) = 0.40, p < 0.01) and Giardia cysts (r(s) = 0.46, p < 0.01). There was a strong positive correlation between abundance of Giardia cysts and that of Cryptosporidium oocysts (r(s) > 0.89, p < 0.01). To sum up, a suite of faecal indicator bacteria can be used as indicators for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in these activated-sludge systems (WWTPs A, B and C). Overall, Giardia duodenalis was noted to be the best Cryptosporidium indicator for human health in the community-based influent wastewater and throughout the treatment process.
TI  - Production and characterization of Clostridium perfringens recombinant beta toxoid.
AB  - In this work, we produced and evaluated a vaccine based on a beta toxoid of Clostridium perfringens type C produced in Escherichia coli (rBT). The non-toxic rBT was innocuous for mice and induced 14 IU mL(-1) of beta antitoxin in rabbits, complying with the European Pharmacopeia and CFR9 - USDA guidelines.
TI  - Study of the cultivable microflora of the large intestine of the rat under varied environmental hyperbaric pressures.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE(S): We conducted an in vivo experiment to investigate the effect of hyperbarometric air pressure on the quantity and composition of the cultivable microflora of the large intestine. METHODS: Using selective culture-based methods, we enumerated from the large intestine total aerobes and total anaerobes, and indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli, other Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Clostridium perfringens, and studied their quantitative variation. RESULTS: Total aerobes and facultative anaerobes (E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae) were increased with an increase in air pressure, whereas the increase caused a drastic reduction in the numbers of total anaerobes and Clostridium perfringens. Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were affected slightly by the altered air pressures. Variation in the numbers of these groups of bacteria was correlated to dose and duration of hyperbaric treatment. CONCLUSION: We conclude from our results that air pressure is an important exogenous factor that strongly modulates bacterial colonization of the large intestine and the composition of the intestinal microflora, and that the occurrence of gastrointestinal disorders during hyperbarism is a result of alteration in the indigenous microflora.
TI  - Effect of sewage treatment plants and diffuse pollution on the occurrence of protozoal parasites in the course of a small river.
AB  - In Germany, protozoal parasites are detected frequently in surface waters. This study aims to assess the parasitological pollution in a river course and two of its tributaries under regular weather conditions. Cryptosporidium was detected in 67% of all samples. The median concentration was 4 oocysts/100l. Giardia lamblia were detected in 90% of the samples. The median concentration of G. lamblia was 22 cysts/100l and increased significantly following the river course. A statistically significant correlation was found between both parasites and the faecal indicators Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli. The intermittent occurrence of Cryptosporidium in the streams investigated was ascribed primarily to diffuse pollution, particularly during rainfall events. The relatively frequent detection of G. lamblia derived mainly from sewage treatment plants. The pathogen concentrations observed present a relevant public health risk as the river is used for recreational activities and agricultural purposes.
TI  - Assessment of microbial quality of commercial and home-made tiger-nut beverages.
AB  - AIMS: We aimed to assess the microbiological quality of Spanish commercial tiger-nut beverages as well as home-made samples collected from supermarkets, street vendors, juice bars and ice-cream parlours located in Valencia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of 44 tiger-nut beverages samples were carried out according to International Standard Organization (ISO) norms and published works which included the total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, yeasts, moulds, Yersinia enterocolitca, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. The obtained results indicated that all the commercial samples were below the detection limit for the viable microorganisms. Results of analysis of those home-made tiger-nut samples revealed that 67% (16 samples) harboured total plate counts while the rest of samples were free from these microorganisms. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 62% (15 samples). E. coli were found in only one sample (4%), yeasts and moulds were detected in 62% (15 samples) each, Shigella was found in 21% (five samples); however, all samples were free from S. aureus, Salmonella, Y. enterocolotica, C. perfringens, Vibrio spp. and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: These results reflected that there exists a rather high contamination level in home-made tiger-nut beverages indicating the need to apply correct and strict HACCP system(s) during manufacturing and storage of these food products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently in these products and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system (s). Tiger-nut beverages are especially well-known products in Spain, hence it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health.
TI  - The peptidoglycan hydrolase TcpG is required for efficient conjugative transfer of pCW3 in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Peptidoglycan hydrolases that are specifically associated with bacterial conjugation systems are postulated to facilitate the assembly of the transfer apparatus by creating a temporally and spatially controlled local opening in the peptidoglycan layer. To date little is known about the role of such enzymes in conjugation systems from Gram-positive bacteria. Conjugative plasmids from the Gram-positive pathogen Clostridium perfringens all encode two putative peptidoglycan hydrolases, TcpG and TcpI, within the conserved tcp transfer locus. Mutation and complementation analysis was used to demonstrate that a functional tcpG gene, but not the tcpI gene, was required for efficient conjugative transfer of pCW3. Furthermore, it was also shown that each of the two predicted catalytic domains of TcpG was functional in C. perfringens and that the predicted catalytic site residues, E-111, D-136, and C-238, present within these functional domains were required for optimal TcpG function. Escherichia coli cells producing TcpG demonstrated a distinctive autoagglutination phenotype and partially purified recombinant TcpG protein was shown to have peptidoglycan hydrolase-like activity on cognate peptidoglycan from C. perfringens. Based on these results it is suggested that TcpG is a functional peptidoglycan hydrolase that is required for efficient conjugative transfer of pCW3, presumably by facilitating the penetration of the pCW3 translocation complex through the cell wall.
TI  - Diet and environment shape fecal bacterial microbiota composition and enteric pathogen load of grizzly bears.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet and environment impact the composition of mammalian intestinal microbiota; dietary or health disturbances trigger alterations in intestinal microbiota composition and render the host susceptible to enteric pathogens. To date no long term monitoring data exist on the fecal microbiota and pathogen load of carnivores either in natural environments or in captivity. This study investigates fecal microbiota composition and the presence of pathogenic Escherichia coli and toxigenic clostridia in wild and captive grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and relates these to food resources consumed by bears. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Feces were obtained from animals of two wild populations and from two captive animals during an active bear season. Wild animals consumed a diverse diet composed of plant material, animal prey and insects. Captive animals were fed a regular granulated diet with a supplement of fruits and vegetables. Bacterial populations were analyzed using quantitative PCR. Fecal microbiota composition fluctuated in wild and in captive animals. The abundance of Clostridium clusters I and XI, and of C. perfringens correlated to regular diet protein intake. Enteroaggregative E. coli were consistently present in all populations. The C. sordellii phospholipase C was identified in three samples of wild animals and for the first time in Ursids. CONCLUSION: This is the first longitudinal study monitoring the fecal microbiota of wild carnivores and comparing it to that of captive individuals of the same species. Location and diet affected fecal bacterial populations as well as the presence of enteric pathogens.
TI  - Identification, Isolation and characterization of a novel azoreductase from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Azo dyes are used widely in the textile, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries as colorants and are often sources of environmental pollution. There are many microorganisms that are able to reduce azo dyes by use of an azoreductase enzyme. It is through the reduction of the azo bonds of the dyes that carcinogenic metabolites are produced thereby a concern for human health. The field of research on azoreductases is growing, but there is very little information available on azoreductases from strict anaerobic bacteria. In this study, the azoreductase gene was identified in Clostridium perfringens, a pathogen that is commonly found in the human intestinal tract. C. perfringens shows high azoreductase activity, especially in the presence of the common dye Direct Blue 15. A gene that encodes for a flavoprotein was isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli, and further purified and tested for azoreductase activity. The azoreductase (known as AzoC) was characterized by enzymatic reaction assays using different dyes. AzoC activity was highest in the presence of two cofactors, NADH and FAD. A strong cofactor effect was shown with some dyes, as dye reduction occurred without the presence of the AzoC (cofactors alone). AzoC was shown to perform best at a pH of 9, at room temperature, and in an anaerobic environment. Enzyme kinetics studies suggested that the association between enzyme and substrate is strong. Our results show that AzoC from C. perfringens has azoreductase activity.
TI  - Potentially pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance in bioaerosols from  cage-housed and floor-housed poultry operations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are used in animal confinement buildings, such as cage-housed (CH) and floor-housed (FH) poultry operations, to lower the likeliness of disease transmission. In FH facilities, antibiotics may also be used at sub-therapeutic levels for growth promotion. Low levels of antibiotic create a selective pressure toward antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in chicken fecal bacteria. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare bacteria and AMR genes in bioaerosols from CH and FH poultry facilities. METHODS: Bioaerosols were collected from 15 CH and 15 FH poultry operations, using stationary area samplers as well as personal sampling devices. Bacteria concentrations were determined by genus- or species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AMR genes were detected using endpoint PCR. RESULTS: Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus spp. were significantly higher in bioaerosols of FH poultry operations than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.001) while Clostridium perfringens was significantly higher in area bioaerosols of CH operations than FH area bioaerosols (P < 0.05). Campylobacter spp. were detected only in bioaerosols of FH facilities. Zinc bacitracin resistance gene, bcrR, erythromycin resistance gene, ermA, and tetracycline resistance gene, tetA/C, were more prevalent in bioaerosols of FH facilities than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria are more concentrated and most AMR genes are more prevalent in bioaerosols of FH poultry operations, where growth-promoting antibiotics may be used.
TI  - Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration for simultaneous recovery of viruses, bacteria and parasites from reclaimed water.
AB  - Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (UF) is a technique that has been reported to be effective for recovering a diverse array of microbes from water, and may also be potentially useful for microbial monitoring of effluent from water reclamation facilities. However, few data are available to indicate the potential limitations and efficacy of the UF technique for treated wastewater. In this study, recovery efficiencies were determined for various options available for performing the tangential-flow UF technique, including hollow-fiber ultrafilter (i.e., dialyzer) type, ultrafilter pre-treatment (i.e., blocking), and elution. MS2 and PhiX174 bacteriophages, Clostridium perfringens spores, Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were seeded into 10-L reclaimed water samples to evaluate UF options. Then a single UF protocol was established and studied using seeded and non-seeded 100-L samples from two water reclamation facilities in Georgia, USA. Baxter Exeltra Plus 210 and Fresenius F200NR dialyzers were found to provide significantly higher microbial recovery than Minntech HPH 1400 hemoconcentrators. The selected final UF method incorporated use of a non-blocked ultrafilter for UF followed by elution using a surfactant-based solution. For 10-L samples, this method achieved recovery efficiencies of greater than 50% recovery of seeded viruses, bacteria, and parasites. There was no significant difference in overall microbial recovery efficiency when the method was applied to 10- and 100-L samples. In addition, detection levels for pathogens in seeded 100-L reclaimed water samples were 1000 PFU HAV, 10,000 GI norovirus particles, <500 Salmonella and <200 Cryptosporidium oocysts. These data demonstrate that UF can be an effective technique for recovering diverse microbes in reclaimed water to monitor and improve effluent water quality in wastewater treatment plants.
TI  - Enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats: diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control.
AB  - This report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats, with an emphasis on Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli associated with granulomatous colitis in Boxers. Veterinarians are challenged when attempting to diagnose animals with suspected bacterial-associated diarrhea because well-scrutinized practice guidelines that provide objective recommendations for implementing fecal testing are lacking. This problem is compounded by similar isolation rates for putative bacterial enteropathogens in animals with and without diarrhea, and by the lack of consensus among veterinary diagnostic laboratories as to which diagnostic assays should be utilized. Most bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting diarrhea, and injudicious administration of antimicrobials could be more harmful than beneficial. Salmonella and Campylobacter are well-documented zoonoses, but antimicrobial administration is not routinely advocated in uncomplicated cases and supportive therapy is recommended. Basic practices of isolation, use of appropriate protective equipment, and proper cleaning and disinfection are the mainstays of control. Handwashing with soap and water is preferred over use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers because spores of C. difficile and C. perfringens are alcohol-resistant, but susceptible to bleach (1:10 to 1:20 dilution of regular household bleach) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide. The implementation of practice guidelines in combination with the integration of validated molecular-based testing and conventional testing is pivotal if we are to optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats.
TI  - Effects of feeding polydextrose on faecal characteristics, microbiota and fermentative end products in healthy adult dogs.
AB  - Polydextrose is a potential prebiotic, but has not been well tested in dogs. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of polydextrose on faecal characteristics, microbial populations and fermentative end products in healthy adult dogs. A total of eight adult hound dogs (3.5 (sem 0.5) years; 20 (sem 0.5) kg) were randomly allotted to one of four test diets containing the following concentrations of polydextrose: (1) 0 % (control); (2) 0.5 %; (3) 1.0 %; or (4) 1.5 %. A Latin square design was used, with each treatment period lasting 14 d (days 0-10 adaptation; days 11-14 fresh and total faecal collection). All dogs were fed to maintain body weight. Data were evaluated for linear and quadratic effects using SAS software. Although apparent total tract DM digestibility was unaffected, total tract crude protein digestibility tended to decrease (P < 0.10) linearly with increasing dietary polydextrose concentrations. Fresh faecal DM percentage tended to decrease (P < 0.10) linearly, while faecal scores increased (P < 0.05; looser stools) with increasing dietary concentrations of polydextrose. Faecal acetate, propionate and total SCFA concentrations increased (P < 0.05) linearly with increased dietary polydextrose. Faecal pH decreased (P < 0.05) linearly with increasing polydextrose. Faecal indole tended to decrease (P < 0.10) linearly with increasing polydextrose, but other faecal protein catabolites were not changed. Faecal Clostridium perfringens linearly decreased (P < 0.05) with increasing dietary polydextrose concentrations, but Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were not affected. Based on the present results, polydextrose appears to act as a highly fermentable fibre, but requires further research to test its potential as a prebiotic in dogs.
TI  - Effects of non-fermented and fermented soybean milk intake on faecal microbiota and faecal metabolites in humans.
AB  - The effects of non-fermented soybean milk (NFSM) and fermented soybean milk (FSM) intake on the faecal microbiota and metabolic activities in 10 healthy volunteers were investigated. Soybean oligosaccharides, raffinose and stachyose were utilized by bifidobacteria except for Bifidobacterium bifidum, but most strains of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens could not use them. During the dietary administration of FSM, the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the faeces increased (p < 0.05), and clostridia decreased (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of faecal sulphide were decreased (p < 0.01) in the intake of FSM. During the dietary administration of NFSM, the number of bifidobacteria tended to increase. These results indicate that the consumption of soybean milk, especially FSM, is related to improvement of the intestinal environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
AB  - A chitosan dextran-based (CD) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. The microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations. In addition, the time-kill efficacy of CD hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. CD hydrogel was found to be effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. Minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000 mg/liter. Dextran aldehyde (DA) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the CD hydrogel with MBC ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. S. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than E. coli. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to CD hydrogel and DA. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of E. coli and S. aureus incubated with CD hydrogel and DA alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. Motility and chemotaxis tests showed E. coli to be inhibited when incubated with DA. The antibacterial activity of CD hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Microbial safety of air-dried and rewetted biosolids.
AB  - To assess microbial safety of treated sewage sludge (biosolids), we examined the  inactivation of microbial indicators for potential bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens. The levels of indicators were determined throughout the air-drying and storage phases of anaerobically digested sewage sludge. Samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) in Victoria, Australia. Established methods were applied for analysis of bacteria and coliphages, based on membrane filtration and layered plates, respectively. In the pan drying phase, the prevalence of Escherichia coli was reduced by >5 log10 compared with sludge entering the pan. Thus, after pan drying of 8-11 months at WWTP A and 15 months at WWTP B, the numbers of E. coli were reduced to below 10(2) cfu/g dry solids (DS). This level is acceptable for unrestricted use in agriculture in Australia (P1 treatment grade), the UK (enhanced treatment status) and the USA (Class A pathogen reduction). Coliphage numbers also decreased substantially during the air-drying phase, indicating that enteric viruses are also likely to be destroyed during this phase. Clostridium perfringens appeared to be an overly conservative indicator. Survival, but not regrowth, of E. coli or Salmonella was observed in rewetted biosolids (15-20% moisture content), after being seeded with these species, indicating a degree of safety of stored biosolids upon rewetting by rain.
TI  - Microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  - It is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. Pyrosequencing targeting the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and Bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. Diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and Bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. The Bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. Clustering and Venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and Bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. Traditional fecal indicators, i.e., Escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and Clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. Besides the Bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., Parasutterella excrementihominis, Veillonella sp., Dialister invisus, Megamonas funiformis, and Ruminococcus lactaris for the human and Lactobacillus amylovorus and Atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. These microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent on the absence or presence of a single indicator. Monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different degree of hydrolysis of palm kernel expeller  peptides against spore-forming and non-spore-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine inhibitory effect of palm kernel expeller (PKE) peptides of different degree of hydrolysis (DH %) against spore-forming bacteria Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Clostridium perfringens; and non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli, Lisinibacillus sphaericus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A range of DH % (50-100) of PKE peptides was prepared using alcalase, and hydrolysis conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). The influence of pH (6.5-10.5), temperature (35-65 degrees C), enzyme/substrate ratio (1-5%) and substrate concentration (1-2%) were studied on the response of the DH. The antibacterial activity of different DH % of PKE peptides was tested by using disc diffusion assay and micro-broth dilution assay. According to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test on each of the PKE peptides of different DH %, the 70 DH % PKE peptide showed greater inhibitory effect compared to the 100 DH % PKE peptide against B. cereus, B. coagulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. stearothermophillus, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Cl. perfringens, Lisinibacillus sphaericus and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The 70 DH % PKE peptides exhibited greatest overall antibacterial effect of the various peptides of PKE evaluated. Further research is needed to determine the mode of action of PKE peptides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Palm kernel expeller peptides, a natural plant product, effectively inhibited the growth of spore-forming and non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Potentially, PKE peptides could be used in food preservation and developed as antibacterial agent in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - Physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in Greece and its public health implications.
AB  - Ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. To evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100 ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of Epirus were studied. The following microbiological parameters were determined: Total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp., Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens. E. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. Samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. Aeromonas spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter sp. and V. cholerae were not detected. Spore forms of C. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's P. aeruginosa and Yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. The presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. In view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.
TI  - Characterization of the betagamma-crystallin domains of betagamma-CAT, a non-lens betagamma-crystallin and trefoil factor complex, from the skin of the toad Bombina maxima.
AB  - betagamma-CAT is a naturally existing 72-kDa complex of a non-lens betagamma-crystallin (alpha-subunit, CAT-alpha) and a trefoil factor (beta-subunit, CAT-beta) that contains a non-covalently linked form of alphabeta(2) and was isolated from the skin secretions of the toad Bombina maxima. The N-terminal region of CAT-alpha (CAT-alphaN, residues 1-170) contains two betagamma-crystallin domains while the C-terminal region (CAT-alphaC) has sequence homology to the membrane insertion domain of the Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin. To examine the biochemical characteristics of the betagamma-crystallin domains of betagamma-CAT, CAT-alphaN, CAT-alphaC and CAT-beta were expressed in Escherichia coli. Co-immunoprecipitation of the naturally assembled betagamma-CAT confirmed that the CAT-alpha and CAT-beta complex always exists. Furthermore, recombinant CAT-beta bound recombinant CAT-alphaN. Ca(2+)-binding motifs were identified in CAT-alphaN, and recombinant CAT-alphaN was able to bind the calcium probe terbium. However, the conformation of CAT-alphaN was not significantly altered upon Ca(2+) binding. betagamma-CAT possesses strong hemolytic activity toward human erythrocytes, and treatment of erythrocytes with betagamma-CAT resulted in a rapid Ca(2+) influx, eventually leading to hemolysis. However, in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), no significant hemolysis was detected, even though the binding and oligomerization of betagamma-CAT in the erythrocyte membrane was observed. Our data demonstrate the binding of CAT-beta (a trefoil factor) to CAT-alphaN (betagamma-crystallin domains) and provide a basis for the formation of a betagamma-crystallin and trefoil factor complex in vivo. Furthermore, the betagamma-crystallin domains of betagamma-CAT are able to bind Ca(2+), and betagamma-CAT-induced hemolysis is Ca(2+) dependent.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Colostrum and amniotic fluid from different species exhibit similar immunomodulating effects in bacterium-stimulated dendritic cells.
AB  - The fetus and newborn are immunologically immature. Bioactive compounds in amniotic fluid (AF) and maternal milk therefore play a key role in the immunological development of the infant intestine. We hypothesized that colostrum and AF exert similar immunomodulatory effects on the developing immune system. Hence, bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells (BMDCs) were co-incubated with Clostridium perfringens A or Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and porcine, bovine, or human AF, colostrum/milk whey fractions. Interleukin (IL) 10, IL-12, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) production was measured. IL-12 production was reduced with all AFs and wheys, and IL-6 and TNF-? were also reduced by porcine AF. Porcine and bovine whey both reduced TNF-? production. Overall, the reductions were most pronounced with the porcine fluids. Only bovine fluids caused strong induction of IL-10. Overall, effects of AF and whey from same species were similar. Viability of stimulated BMDCs was not significantly affected by the fluids. Neutralization of IL-10, transforming growth factor ?, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) did not remove the IL-12-inhibiting effect, but EGF neutralization increased IL-10 production. Addition of EFG to DCs enhanced the bacterium-induced cytokine production contrary to the effect of AF and colostrums, ruling out EGF as the inhibitory component in the fluids.
TI  - Etiologic agents and diseases found associated with clinical aspergillosis in falcons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe parasitological, microbiological, and pathological findings associated with the isolation of Aspergillus species in 94 clinically diseased captive falcons from Dubai. Concomitant agents and/or diseases were identified in 64 cases, causing either single (n = 36) or multiple coinfections (n = 28). Diagnoses found more often in association with aspergillosis were chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS) (n = 29), Caryospora sp. (n = 16), Serratospiculum seurati infestation (n = 14), cestodiasis (n = 6), bumblefoot (n = 5), trematodosis due to Strigea falconispalumbi (n = 5), trichomoniasis (n = 4), Babesia shortti (n = 4), Mannheimia (Pastorella) haemolytica (n = 4), interstitial hepatitis (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxemia (n = 2). Compared with a control group of 2000 diseased falcons without evidence of aspergillosis, the prevalence of Babesia shortti, CFIDS, Mannheimia (Pastorella) haemolytica, Escherichia coli, and falcon herpes virus infection was conspicuously higher in association with aspergillosis. These entities may be considered suitable candidates as predisposing factors for the mycosis.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - [Factors associated with the quality of well water and the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the municipality of Abomey-Calavi in Benin].
AB  - The objective of this work is to assess the factors associated with the water quality of household wells, suggest solutions to improve it, and study the prevalence of water-borne diseases in this community. The quality of well water and the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the municipality were studied by analysis of the microbiological indicators currently used to assess drinking-water quality and the retrospective study of waterborne diseases treated in the local health centres. The wells surveyed were contaminated by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp, Clostridium perfringens and fecal streptococci, at prevalences of 12.5, 12.2, 12.2, 12.1, 12 and 11.1%, respectively. The high rates of diarrhea, urinary infections, typhoid fever and abdominal pain found in the retrospective study were consistent with the results of the well-water quality assessment. These results showed that human activity has strongly influenced water quality, especially the lack of sanitation in the different districts and neighbourhoods. Other factors affecting the vulnerability of well water include poor waste management by households, the low depth of the water table, the nature of the soil, and the permeability of the aquifer used. Improvement in water quality, sanitation, and personal hygiene will make it possible to reduce considerably the propagation of these diseases and several others. It is therefore important to provide these populations with the necessary equipment for an adequate drinking water supply, but also to promote health education to avoid water pollution. The search for solutions to these problems will lead to a plan for future action.
TI  - Effects of land uses on fecal indicator bacteria in the water and soil of a tropical watershed.
AB  - Effects of different land uses on densities of Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens in the water and soil of a tropical watershed were investigated. Densities of fecal indicator bacteria (FIBs) in the watershed exhibited a clear land-use dependency in the stream water. Significantly higher concentrations were detected in the urban portion of the stream (417, 420, and 44 CFU 100 mL(-1) for E. coli, enterococci, and C. perfringens, respectively) than in the forest portion (54, 32, and 5 CFU 100 mL(-1) for E. coli, enterococci, and C. perfringens, respectively). High concentrations of FIBs were also detected in the soil of the watershed with concentration ranges of 603-1,820,000, 69-17,000, and 0-525 CFU 100 g soil(-1) for E. coli, enterococci, and C. perfringens, respectively, which however were not affected by the different land uses. Prior cumulative rainfall significantly correlated with concentrations of E. coli and enterococci in the urban stream water (r=0.73-0.87, P<0.05), but not with the alternative FIB C. perfringens. Poor correlations were observed in the forest reach of the stream for all FIBs. Furthermore, the concentration of C. perfringens only correlated strongly and significantly with E. coli and enterococci in stream water (r=0.70-0.82, P<0.05), but not in tropical soil, indicating different survival and transport behaviors.
TI  - Isolation of microbial pathogens of subclinical mastitis from raw sheep's milk of Epirus (Greece) and their role in its hygiene.
AB  - The natural raw milk microflora is a factor that expresses its sensorial characteristics. The microbial charge into the mammary gland of healthy animal is low and the application of right and healthy conditions during milking and cheese making procedure, prevents from contaminating as well as maintains the natural microflora in order to lend the particular characteristics of milk. The purpose of the present project was the study of the Total Viable Count (T.V.C.) and the count of total psychrotropic bacteria of raw sheep milk from Boutsiko and Karamaniko breeds, collected from healthy animals, as well as the isolation, identification and enumeration of pathogenic bacteria related with the hygiene and the quality of raw sheep milk (with a particular interest in bacteria that may cause human infection). During the experiment we examined two hundred forty (240) samples of raw sheep milk. In these samples a) Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens (vegetative cells and spores) and Bacillus sp. were isolated and identified b) the Total Viable Count and the total number of psychrotropic bacteria were also specified. The sampling, the preparation of samples and decimal dilutions were based on international methods. The Total viable count was determined using the standard methods of the American Public Health Association, 2002. The total number of psychrotropic bacteria was determined using APHA 1976, 1978 rules. The identification of the bacteria was carried out according to the Bergey's manual. Microscopic examination of Gram stained cells, catalase, oxidase and biochemical tests were performed when necessary to further identify. From the 240 milk samples tested, only 5% were E. coli positive, with mean counts ranged from 2 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml. S. aureus was isolated from 24% of the samples and the mean count per ml was ranged from <10 to 3.4 x 10(2). Meanwhile, Bacillus spp. was also detected in 29% samples. Vegetative forms and spores of C. perfringens were detected in 13% and 63% of the samples respectively. However, microbiological analyses revealed the presence of a small number of selected pathogens in milk samples such as Salmonella, which was only detected in 5% of the samples. Listeria sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Vibrio cholerae were never found. From the experimental results, the Total Viable Count from raw sheep milk samples, fulfils the microbiological criteria of EU Legislation in a percentage of approximately 97%.

TI  - Assessment of levels of bacterial contamination of large wild game meat in Europe.
AB  - The variations in prevalence and levels of pathogens and fecal contamination indicators in large wild game meat were studied to assess their potential impact on consumers. This analysis was based on hazard analysis, data generation and statistical analysis. A total of 2919 meat samples from three species (red deer, roe deer, wild boar) were collected at French game meat traders' facilities using two sampling protocols. Information was gathered on the types of meat cuts (forequarter or haunch; first sampling protocol) or type of retail-ready meat (stewing meat or roasting meat; second protocol), and also on the meat storage conditions (frozen or chilled), country of origin (eight countries) and shooting season (autumn, winter, spring). The samples were analyzed in both protocols for detection and enumeration of Escherichia coli, coagulase+staphylococci and Clostridium perfringens. In addition, detection and enumeration of thermotolerant coliforms and Listeria monocytogenes were performed for samples collected in the first and second protocols, respectively. The levels of bacterial contamination of the raw meat were determined by performing statistical analysis involving probabilistic techniques and Bayesian inference. C. perfringens was found in the highest numbers for the three indicators of microbial quality, hygiene and good handling, and L. monocytogenes in the lowest. Differences in contamination levels between game species and between meats distributed as chilled or frozen products were not significant. These results might be included in quantitative exposure assessments.
TI  - Effects of genetically modified T2A-1 rice on faecal microflora of rats during 90 day supplementation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many animal studies have been performed on products with the Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxin-encoding gene (Bt products), but less have focused on its effects on intestinal microflora owing to difficulties in culturing. This 90 day study was designed to assess unintended effects of genetically modified T2A-1 rice (GMR) on selected intestinal bacteria (Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium genus, Escherichia coli subgroup, Enterococcus genus and Clostridium perfringens) of rats by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. RESULTS: During the whole experiment, no statistically significant differences in the numbers of specific bacteria and total bacteria were found between the GMR group and its parental group. At all stages of the experiment the two main probiotics (Lactobacillus group and Bifidobacterium genus) in faeces accounted for 11-23% of the total bacteria, whereas the conditional pathogens (E. coli subgroup, Enterococcus genus and C. perfringens) made up less than 1% of the total bacteria. B/E (log(10) copies of Bifidobacterium genome g(-1) faeces/log(10) copies of E. coli genome g(-1) faeces) ratios from 1.19 to 1.34 were obtained. Furthermore, significant correlations (P < 0.01) between the real-time PCR method and the plate count method were found, with r values ranging from 0.60 to 0.75. CONCLUSION: No adverse effects on the numbers of specific bacteria in rat faeces were observed as a result of GMR feeding. The real-time PCR method is recommended in further studies on the composition and dynamics of the intestinal bacteria community for better safety assessment of GM materials.
TI  - Bacterial monocultures, propionate, butyrate and H2O2 modulate the expression, secretion and structure of the fasting-induced adipose factor in gut epithelial cell lines.
AB  - Previous research showed that an intestinal microbial community represses the fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) in the gut epithelium, thereby increasing fat storage in the host. This study was designed to investigate the overall effect of different bacterial species and metabolites on FIAF in intestinal (Caco-2, HT-29 and HCT-116) and hepatic (HepG2) cancer cell lines. First, we showed that FIAF was present in different isoforms, and secreted as N-glycosylated proteins, exclusively at the basal side of the cell monolayer. Second, co-incubation of cell lines with bacterial monocultures and metabolites altered both FIAF production and isoform appearance. Propionate and/or butyrate treatment increased FIAF expression and cleavage in all tested cell lines. In contrast, different bacteria induced cell line-specific FIAF modulation. Clostridium perfringens induced FIAF isoform changes in Caco-2 cells. Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron treatment resulted in cell line-specific FIAF increases, whereas Escherichia coli significantly decreased FIAF expression in HCT-116 cells. Treatment with H(2) O(2) and peroxide-producing E. faecalis strains induced FIAF isoform changes in Caco-2 cells. Since bacteria and bacterial metabolites alter both FIAF production and isoform appearance, further investigation may reveal an important role for bacteria in FIAF-regulated physiological processes, such as cell differentiation and fat metabolism.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens in Hawaiian coastal streams--associations with fecal indicators, land cover, and water quality.
AB  - This work aimed to understand the distribution of five bacterial pathogens in O'ahu coastal streams and relate their presence to microbial indicator concentrations, land cover of the surrounding watersheds, and physical-chemical measures of stream water quality. Twenty-two streams were sampled four times (in December and March, before sunrise and at high noon) to capture seasonal and time of day variation. Salmonella, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus were widespread -12 of 22 O'ahu streams had all five pathogens. All stream waters also had detectable concentrations of four fecal indicators and total vibrio with log mean +/- standard deviation densities of 2.2 +/- 0.8 enterococci, 2.7 +/- 0.7 Escherichia coli, 1.1 +/- 0.7 Clostridium perfringens, 1.2 +/- 0.8 F(+) coliphages, and 3.6 +/- 0.7 total vibrio per 100 ml. Bivariate associations between pathogens and indicators showed enterococci positively associated with the greatest number of bacterial pathogens. Higher concentrations of enterococci and higher incidence of Campylobacter were found in stream waters collected before sunrise, suggesting these organisms are sensitive to sunlight. Multivariate regression models of microbes as a function of land cover and physical-chemical water quality showed positive associations between Salmonella and agricultural and forested land covers, and between S. aureus and urban and agricultural land covers; these results suggested that sources specific to those land covers may contribute these pathogens to streams. Further, significant associations between some microbial targets and physical-chemical stream water quality (i.e., temperature, nutrients, turbidity) suggested that organism persistence may be affected by stream characteristics. Results implicate streams as a source of pathogens to coastal waters. Future work is recommended to determine infectious risks of recreational waterborne illness related to O'ahu stream exposures and to mitigate these risks through control of land-based runoff sources.
TI  - Structure of an archaeal-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase sensitive to inhibition by aspartate.
AB  - The crystal structure of an archaeal-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Clostridium perfringens has been determined based on X-ray data extending to 3 A. The asymmetric unit of the structure includes two tetramers (each a dimer-of-dimers) of the enzyme. The precipitant, malonate, employed for the crystallization is itself a weak inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and a malonate molecule is seen in the active-site in the crystal structure. The allosteric binding sites for aspartate (an inhibitor) and glucose-6-phosphate (an activator) observed in the Escherichia coli and Zea mays phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase structures, respectively, are not conserved in the C. perfringens structure. Aspartate inhibits the C. perfringens enzyme competitively with respect to the substrate, Mg(++.) phosphoenolpyruvate. A mechanism for inhibition is proposed based on the structure and sequence comparisons with other archaeal-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases with differing sensitivity to inhibition by aspartate.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a putative endolysin encoded by episomal phage phiSM101 of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens produces potent toxins and histolytic enzymes, causing various diseases including life-threatening fulminant diseases in humans and other animals. Aiming at utilizing a phage endolysin as a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics, we surveyed the genome and bacteriophage sequences of C. perfringens. A phiSM101 muramidase gene (psm) revealed by this study can be assumed to encode an N-acetylmuramidase, since the N-terminal catalytic domain deduced from the gene shows high homology of those of N-acetylmuramidases. The psm gene is characteristic in that it is present in phiSM101, an episomal phage of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens type A strain, SM101, and also in that homologous genes are present in the genomes of all five C. perfringens toxin types. The psm gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a protein histidine-tagged at the N-terminus (Psm-his). Psm-his was purified to homogeneity by nickel-charged immobilized metal affinity chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme lysed cells of all C. perfringens toxin types but not other clostridial species tested, as was shown by a turbidity reduction assay. These results indicate the Psm-his is useful as a cell-wall lytic enzyme and also suggest that it is potentially useful for biocontrol of this organism.
TI  - Quality of water sources used as drinking water in a Brazilian peri-urban area.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to assess bacteriological quality of drinking water in a peri-urban area located in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 89 water samples were collected from community plastic tanks and 177 water samples from wells were collected bimonthly, from September 2007 to November 2008, for evaluating bacteriological parameters including: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and heterotrophic plate count (HPC). Clostridium perfringens was investigated in a subsample (40 samples from community plastic tank and 40 from wells). E. coli was present in 5 (5.6%) samples from community plastic tanks (2.0 - 5.1x10(4) MPN/100mL) and in 70 (39.5%) well samples (2.0 - 8.6x10(4) MPN/100mL). Thus, these samples were not in accordance with the Brazilian Regulation. Enterococcus was detected in 20 (22.5%) samples of the community plastic tanks (1 to 79 NC/100mL) and in 142 (80.2%) well samples (1 to >200 NC/100mL). C. perfringens was detected in 5 (12.5%) community plastic tanks samples and in 35 (87.5%) wells samples (2.2 to >16 MPN/100mL). HPC were above 500 CFU/mL in 5 (5.6%) waters from community plastic tanks. In wells samples, the HPC ranged from <1 to 1.6x10(4) CFU/mL. The residual chlorine did not attend the standard established in the drinking water legislation (0.2 mg/L), except in 20 (22.5%) samples. These results confirm the vulnerability of the water supply systems in this peri-urban area what is clearly a public health concern.
TI  - Gut bacteria alteration in obese people and its relationship with gene polymorphism.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the differences in cultivable gut bacteria and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPAR-gamma2) gene Pro12Ala variation in obese and normal-weight Chinese people. METHODS: Using culture methods, the amounts of Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Bacteroides, Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) in the feces of 52 obese participants [body mass index (BMI): >/= 28 kg/m(2)] and 52 participants of normal-weight (BMI: 18.5-24 kg/m(2)) were obtained. Study participants completed comprehensive questionnaires and underwent clinical laboratory tests. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-PFLP) assay was used to analyze PPAR-gamma2 gene Pro12Ala variation. RESULTS: The obese group exhibited a lower amount of C. perfringens (6.54 +/- 0.65 vs 6.94 +/- 0.57, P = 0.001) and Bacteroides (9.81 +/- 0.58 vs 10.06 +/- 0.39, P = 0.012) than their normal-weight counterparts. No major differences were observed in Pro12Ala genotype distribution between the two groups; however, obese individuals with a Pro/Ala genotype had a significantly lower level of Bacteroides (9.45 +/- 0.62 vs 9.93 +/- 0.51, P = 0.027) than those with a Pro/Pro genotype. In addition, the obese group demonstrated a higher stool frequency (U = 975, P < 0.001) and a looser stool (U = 1062, P = 0.015) than the normal-weight group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated interactions among cultivable gut flora, host genetic factors and obese phenotype and this might be helpful for obesity prevention.
TI  - Inactivation of indicators and pathogens in cattle feedlot manures and compost as determined by molecular and culture assays.
AB  - Accurate and conservative information about pathogen inactivation rates is needed as the basis for safe manure management on beef cattle feedlots. The survival of indicators and pathogens in faecal pen manure, stockpiled manure and manure compost was measured with autochthonous indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, total coliforms) and pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni) using culture and/or real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods. Additionally, the manures were incubated at 20, 37, 50 and 60 degrees C in microcosms to quantify the persistence of autochthonous microorganisms and selected process performance surrogates (Clostridium sporogenes, green fluorescent protein-labelled E. coli and L. monocytogenes). Estimated qPCR cell counts indicated that up to four orders of magnitude more target cells were present compared with the culturable counts. Corresponding T(90) estimates were up to sixfold higher. This study demonstrates the benefits of nucleic acid-based quantification of pathogen inactivation in cattle manures and concludes that the concurrent analysis of microorganisms by molecular and culture methods provides complementary value.
TI  - Review of enteric outbreaks in prisons: effective infection control interventions.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify documented outbreaks, worldwide, of enteric illness in correctional facilities over the last 10 years to understand the epidemiology of the outbreaks and explicitly identify effective infection control measures. STUDY DESIGN: Review of literature and outbreak investigation reports. METHODS: Computer-aided searches of literature databases and systematic searches of government websites were completed to identify relevant outbreak reports. Reference lists were hand-searched to validate the electronic search methodology. Reports identified through personal communications with public health officials were also included. RESULTS: Of the 72 outbreaks meeting the inclusion criteria, 76% and 21% were associated with bacterial agents and viral agents, respectively. The majority of outbreaks were associated with Salmonella (n=20), Clostridium perfringens (n=14), norovirus (n=14), pathogenic Escherichia coli (n=10) and Campylobacter spp. (n=5). Transmission was primarily foodborne (67%). During an outbreak, the most common control measures included limiting movements of ill inmates and staff, and their exclusion from kitchen duty. The most common retrospectively reported preventative recommendations included monitoring food temperatures and effective infection control procedures. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to monitor food temperatures to prevent enteric outbreaks in prisons. Training in safe food handling should be offered to inmates who work in the kitchen. Enteric outbreaks are best controlled by effective infection control practices, while active surveillance and early diagnosis may prevent further spread of illness.
TI  - Microbial ecology of fish species ongrowing in Greek sea farms and their watery environment.
AB  - The present study focuses on the bacteriological profile of both watery ecosystem and fishes from different North and Central West Greek fish-farms ongrowing euryhaline fish species. The natural microflora of the fish and the water of their ongrowing units in selected farms were studied for a period of 20 months. The analyzed samples were mainly sea bream (Sparus aurata) 61.3% and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 24%. In most of the watery ecosystems coming from the different sampling areas, total and fecal coliforms as well as total and fecal streptococci were abundant in all water samples. Enterococcus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas were present at a level of 3 logs cfu/100 ml. The anaerobic Clostridium perfringens was found in vegetative (21.3%) and spore forms (13.3%). It is of interest to note that pathogens as Pasteurella piscicida and Vibrio anguillarum were isolated only in a small number of samples. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 4% of the samples, other Staphylococcus sp. in 29.3%, E. coli in 30.7%, Salmonella sp. in 1.3%, Pseudomonas sp. in 13.3%, Clostridia lec(-) in 49.3%, Bacillus sp. in 38.7%, Vibrio sp. in 18.7%, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus sp. in 36% kappaalphaiota 29.3% respectively. Vegetative forms of C. perfringens were detected in 22.7%. Although, our results showed no significant correlations between the sea water and fish microflora, more focus on this bipolar interacting system should be necessary in order to avoid any possible disturbance in the balance of the healthy farming ecosystem with the host organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the enniatin B, produced by Fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The enniatins (ENs) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of Fusarium sp. The EN B was purified from extracts of Fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (PDB), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (LC) followed by an analytical LC. The purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study. The pure fraction of EN B was utilized to determine the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, EN B induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms tested and no significant differences over control were detected when Caco-2 cells were exposed to EN B, at any of the concentrations used.
TI  - Necrotic enteritis in young calves.
AB  - Non-enterotoxin (CPE)-producing Clostridium perfringens type A has been associated with enteritis in calves. Recent evidence has suggested that a novel toxin, named beta2 (CPB2), is implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease, although there is little evidence supporting this. In the current study, the role of C. perfringens type A in an outbreak of enteritis in calves was studied. Two 20-day-old dairy calves exhibiting apathy and reluctance to eat, with paresis of the anterior limbs, were euthanized for postmortem examination. Gross and histological changes compatible with acute enteritis, rumenitis, meningitis, and pneumonia were seen in both calves. Clostridium perfringens type A non-CPE, non-CPB2 was isolated from the abomasum and the small intestine. Escherichia coli ONTH8 (with cdtBIII and f17 virulence genes detected by polymerase chain reaction) was also isolated from the brain, abomasum, and intestine from both calves. All the samples were negative for Salmonella spp. When the C. perfringens strain was inoculated into bovine ligated small and large intestinal loops, cell detachment, erosion, and hemorrhage of the lamina propria were observed, predominantly in the small intestine. The results suggest that non-CPE, non-CPB2 C. perfringens type A is able to induce pathologic changes in the intestine of calves, probably enhanced by other pathogens, such as some pathogenic E. coli strains.
TI  - Hot water surface pasteurisation of lamb carcasses: microbial effects and cost-benefit considerations.
AB  - Although hot water pasteurisation of carcasses is accepted as a general intervention in USA, this is not the case in Europe. The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the microbiological effects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses, both after slaughtering and dressing and following subsequent chilling and storage; (ii) to discuss hot water pasteurisation from a public health and cost-benefit perspective; (iii) to discuss the benefits of hot water pasteurisation compared with use of separate meat processing streams for high-risk carcasses; (iv) to evaluate the use of recycled hot water in a hygienic context and in relation to EU regulations; and (v) to consider the technological and sensory aspects of hot water pasteurisation of lamb carcasses. Samples were collected from 420 naturally contaminated lamb carcasses, with 50% of the carcasses (n=210) subject to hot water pasteurisation at 82 degrees C for 8s immediately after slaughter. Surface swab samples from 4500 cm(2) areas on carcasses were collected at slaughter, after chilling for 24 h, and after chilling for five days. The microbial analyses included Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and aerobic plate count (APC). A resuscitation step using Tryptone Soya Agar was included in the microbiological analyses. Hot water pasteurisation significantly reduced the levels of E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, B. cereus and APC (all P<0.001). E. coli colony forming unit (CFU) reduction was 99.5%, corresponding to a reduction of 1.85 log CFU per carcass. E. coli was isolated from 66% of control carcasses and from 26% of pasteurised carcasses. After 24h storage, the reduction in E. coli was increased to 2.02 log, and after five days E. coli could not be isolated from the pasteurised carcasses. These results suggest that surface pasteurisation could be an important and efficient procedure (critical control point) for reducing generic E. coli and thereby shiga toxin-producing E. coli on carcasses, and thus the risk for disease among consumers. The recycled water had acceptable physical and chemical parameters and no spore-forming bacteria were detected. Although some carcass discolouration was observed, after 24h the colour was acceptable. Our data provide relevant input for some of the data gaps regarding hot water pasteurisation and indicate that replacing the expensive system of separate processing of high-risk carcasses with hot water surface pasteurisation should be considered as a serious option.
TI  - Identification and cloning of two immunogenic Clostridium perfringens proteins, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO) of C. perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium-related poultry diseases such as necrotic enteritis (NE) and gangrenous dermatitis (GD) cause substantial economic losses on a global scale. Two antigenic Clostridium perfringens proteins, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO), were identified by reaction with immune sera from commercial meat-type chickens with clinical outbreak of Clostridium infections. In addition to the genes encoding EF-Tu and PFO, C. perfringens alpha-toxin and necrotic enteritis B-like (NetB) toxin were also expressed in Escherichia coli and their corresponding recombinant proteins were purified. Using the four recombinant proteins as target antigens in ELISA immunoassays, high serum antibody titers were observed not only in chickens with clinical signs of Clostridium infections, but also in apparently healthy animals from the same disease-endemic farm. By contrast, no antibodies against any of the proteins were present in the serum of a specific pathogen-free bird. In ELISA using recombinant proteins of C. perfringens, the levels of anti-bacterial protein antibodies were also higher in chickens which were experimentally induced to show NE clinical signs after co-infection with C. perfringens and Eimeria maxima compared with uninfected controls. These results show that two antigenic C. perfringens proteins, EF-Tu and PFO can be useful detection antigens for C. perfringens-afflicted infections in commercial poultry.
TI  - Expression and purification of functional Clostridium perfringens alpha and epsilon toxins in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The alpha and epsilon toxins are 2 of the 4 major lethal toxins of the pathogen Clostridium perfringens. In this study, the expression of the epsilon toxin (etx) gene of C. perfringens was optimized by replacing rare codons with high-frequency codons, and the optimized gene was synthesized using overlapping PCR. Then, the etx gene or the alpha-toxin gene (cpa) was individually inserted into the pTIG-Trx expression vector with a hexahistidine tag and a thioredoxin (Trx) to facilitate their purification and induce the expression of soluble proteins. The recombinant alpha toxin (rCPA) and epsilon toxin (rETX) were highly expressed as soluble forms in the recipient Escherichia coli BL21 strain, respectively. The rCPA and rETX were purified using Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. And the entire purification process recovered about 40% of each target protein from the starting materials. The purified target toxins formed single band at about 42kDa (rCPA) or 31kDa (rETX) in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their functional activity was confirmed by bioactivity assays. We have shown that the production of large amounts of soluble and functional proteins by using the pTIG-Trx vector in E. coli is a good alternative for the production of native alpha and epsilon toxins and could also be useful for the production of other toxic proteins with soluble forms.
TI  - Intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B virus infection. Intestinal microbiota of HBV cirrhotic patients.
AB  - To unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in Chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic hepatitis B, decompensated HBV cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative PCR and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens in fecal crude DNA and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. Data analysis indicated that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of HBV cirrhotic patients. The Bifidobacteria/Enterobacteriaceae (B/E) ratio, which may indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis B to 0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis (for all, P < 0.01). This suggests that B/E ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. The data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. Fecal secretory IgA and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated HBV cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.
TI  - Synergistic antimicrobial activity of galangal (Alpinia galanga), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and lemon iron bark (Eucalyptus staigerana) extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study the synergistic antimicrobial activities of combinations of extracts from galangal (Alpinia galanga), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and lemon iron bark (Eucalyptus staigerana) were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Clostridium perfringens. Chemical compositions of these extracts were also determined to provide further insight into antimicrobial constituents and their potential mechanisms of action. RESULTS: Combinations of galangal with either rosemary or lemon iron bark showed synergistic antimicrobial activity. Specifically, galangal and rosemary showed synergistic activity against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes only, while galangal and lemon iron bark showed synergistic activity against E. coli and S. typhimurium. Chemical compositions of the extracts were determined by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis. The major chemical components of the galangal and lemon iron bark extracts were 1'-acetoxy-chavicol acetate (1'ACA) (63.4%) and neral (15.6%), respectively, while 1,8-cineole (26.3%) and camphor (20.3%) were identified as major chemical components of the rosemary extract. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that galangal, rosemary and lemon iron bark extracts contain components that may have different modes of antimicrobial action and combinations of these extracts may have potential as natural antimicrobials to preserve foods.
TI  - Effect of dietary prebiotic supplementation on the performance, intestinal microflora, and immune response of broilers.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with the prebiotics fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) and mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) on the performance, small intestinal microflora, and immune response of broilers. Two hundred forty 1-d-old Ross broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 6 dietary treatment groups: control, avilamycin (6 mg/kg), 0.25% FOS, 0.5% FOS, 0.025% MOS, and 0.05% MOS. Each treatment was fed to 4 replicates of 10 birds per diet for 4 wk. Except for the 0.5% FOS group, the overall BW gains of birds treated with avilamycin and prebiotics were significantly(P < 0.05) higher than those of the control group. No significant differences were found between the control and supplemented groups in overall feed intake, feed conversion, and mortality. The 0.05% MOS group was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the control and 0.5% FOS groups in heterophil:lymphocyte ratio and basophil level. Concentrations of plasma IgA and IgG were not significantly different among the treatment groups. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that supplementation of the diet with avilamycin or prebiotics caused significant (P < 0.05) changes in the small intestinal microbial community, as determined in samples obtained at the ileocecal junction. The populations of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli decreased with 0.25% FOS, 0.05% MOS, or avilamycin, and lactobacilli increased in the 0.25% FOS and 0.25% MOS treatment groups. Total bacteria increased in the 0.25% FOS and 0.05% MOS treatments and decreased in the avilamycin treatment. Feeding 0.25% FOS and 0.05% MOS resulted in an increase in lactobacillus community diversity in the ileum. Our results showed that 0.25% FOS and 0.05% MOS were comparable with avilamycin in improving productivity in broilers raised in wire floor cages up to 28 d of age. Plasma immunoglobulins were not affected by prebiotics, but the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio, basophil level, and microbial population in the ileum were significantly affected.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a lactose-inducible promoter system for controlled gene expression in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen which causes many diseases in humans and animals. While some genetic tools exist for working with C. perfringens, a tightly regulated, inducible promoter system is currently lacking. Therefore, we constructed a plasmid-based promoter system that provided regulated expression when lactose was added. This plasmid (pKRAH1) is an Escherichia coli-C. perfringens shuttle vector containing the gene encoding a transcriptional regulator, BgaR, and a divergent promoter upstream of gene bgaL (bgaR-P(bgaL)). To measure transcription at the bgaL promoter in pKRAH1, the E. coli reporter gene gusA, encoding beta-glucuronidase, was placed downstream of the P(bgaL) promoter to make plasmid pAH2. When transformed into three strains of C. perfringens, pAH2 exhibited lactose-inducible expression. C. perfringens strain 13, a commonly studied strain, has endogenous beta-glucuronidase activity. We mutated gene bglR, encoding a putative beta-glucuronidase, and observed an 89% decrease in endogenous activity with no lactose. This combination of a system for regulated gene expression and a mutant of strain 13 with low beta-glucuronidase activity are useful tools for studying gene regulation and protein expression in an important pathogenic bacterium. We used this system to express the yfp-pilB gene, comprised of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-encoding gene fused to an assembly ATPase gene involved in type IV pilus-dependent gliding motility in C. perfringens. Expression in the wild-type strain showed that YFP-PilB localized mostly to the poles of cells, but in a pilC mutant it localized throughout the cell, demonstrating that the membrane protein PilC is required for polar localization of PilB.
TI  - Microbiological quality of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in Nunavik, Quebec: a pilot study.
AB  - This pilot study was aimed at documenting the presence of fecal indicators and enteric pathogens in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) from 6 communities in Nunavik, Quebec. One to four 2 kg samples of mussels were collected at low tide in each community. Samples were investigated by enumeration methods for the fecal indicators enterococci, Escherichia coli, F-specific coliphages, Clostridium perfringens, and by molecular identification for the pathogens norovirus, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari, verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (particularly serovar O157:H7), Shigella spp., and Yersinia enterocolitica. In 5 communities, the presence of Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. was also tested by microscopy and molecular methods and that of Toxoplasma gondii was tested by molecular methods. Apart from small quantities of Clostridium perfringens in 2 samples, no bacterial or viral pathogens were detected in the mussels. Toxoplasma gondii was also not detected. However, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 18% and 73% of the samples investigated for these pathogens, respectively. When considering the indicators and the viral and bacterial pathogens investigated, the mussels examined were of good microbiological quality, but considering the presence of potentially zoonotic protozoa, it should be recommended that consumers cook the molluscs well before eating them.
TI  - Companion animals symposium: microbes and gastrointestinal health of dogs and cats.
AB  - Recent molecular studies have revealed complex bacterial, fungal, archaeal, and viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in Firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.
TI  - Tangential-flow ultrafiltration with integrated inhibition detection for recovery of surrogates and human pathogens from large-volume source water and finished drinking water.
AB  - Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was optimized for the recovery of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens spores, bacteriophages MS2 and PRD1, murine norovirus, and poliovirus seeded into 100-liter surface water (SW) and drinking water (DW) samples. SW and DW collected from two drinking water treatment plants were then evaluated for human enteric viruses.
TI  - Comparison of selected nutrients and bacteria from common contiguous soils inside and outside swine lagoon effluent spray fields after long-term use.
AB  - Swine (Sus scofa domestica) lagoon effluent is a valuable resource. In the U.S. Mid-South it is applied from April to September to fertilize grass hay in spray-irrigated fields. Lagoon levels of nutrients and bacteria, and soil levels of nutrients have been documented, but little was known of effluent bacterial levels in soil. The present study examined levels of selected effluent bacteria and nutrients in soils inside and outside spray fields after >15 yr of effluent irrigation. Samples were collected February to March 2009 from contiguous soils spanning adjacent irrigated and nonirrigated areas. Separate soil cores for bacterial and nutrient tests were collected in pairs <10 cm apart. Five cores each were collected at 15-m intervals and combined, respectively, to comprise inside and outside samples from each of 20 soils (four each from five farms/spray fields). Analyses of data combined across all soils showed higher pH and Mehlich-3-extracrable (M3-) P, Mg, K, Na, Cu, and Zn inside than outside spray fields, while total N, total C, M3-Ca, and M3-Mn did not differ. Bacterial levels were higher inside than outside spray fields for heterotrophic plate counts, thermotolerant coliforms, Staphylococcus spp., and Clostridium perfringens, but levels of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were not different. Cultural presence/absence tests for three pathogens (Listeria spp., Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp.) detected only Listeria spp., which did not differ inside (23% positive samples) and outside (28% positive). Molecular tests detected all three pathogens at low levels that were not different inside and outside. We found no evidence of cumulative buildup of Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., or Salmonela s. in spray field soils.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Isolation of culturable microorganisms from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the southeastern United States.
AB  - Reports of diseases in marine mammals are increasing worldwide, however our understanding of the microorganisms associated with marine mammals is still limited. In this study, we cultured bacteria and fungi isolated from the upper respiratory tract (blowhole), gastric fluid and anus of 180 wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from two estuarine locations along the southeastern Atlantic Coast of the United States. A total of 339 and 491 isolates from Charleston, SC (CHS) and Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) dolphins, respectively, were cultured from gastric (70 CHS/82 IRL), fecal (141 CHS/184 IRL), and blowhole (128 CHS/225 IRL) swabs on selective media used for routine clinical microorganisms of human concern. The most frequently cultured Gram-negative bacteria from all sample and study types were Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus sp., and Staphylococcus Coag. Neg were the predominant organisms. For fungi, the most abundant species were Candida glabrata, budding yeasts, and Candida tropicalis. Of concern, the MRSA strain of Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blowhole and gastric swabs from CHS dolphins. In general, a greater prevalence of bacteria and fungi (four-fold increase) were cultured from IRL than CHS animals. Together, these culture-dependent studies, coupled to on-going culture-independent approaches, should help establish a baseline of microorganisms associated with bottlenose dolphins and aid in the identification of organisms responsible for infectious diseases(s) in these animals.
TI  - Effects of feeding distillers dried grains with solubles to broilers from 0 to 28 days posthatch on broiler performance, feed manufacturing efficiency, and selected intestinal characteristics.
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of 2 levels (0 vs. 8%) of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in a starter broiler diet (0 to 14 d; 45 replicates/treatment) after these same birds were subsequently fed a grower diet (14 to 28 d) with either 0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, or 30% DDGS (9 replicates/treatment). RossxRoss 308 male broilers were used in this experiment, and evaluation criteria consisted of feed mill parameters, broiler growth, relative liver weight, ileal viscosity, and cecal content count of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli analyzed by both selective media and real-time PCR. Increased inclusion of DDGS resulted in a nonlinear response for production rate (P<0.05), conditioner energy usage (P<0.01), and pellet mill energy usage (P<0.05). Increasing DDGS resulted in a linear decrease in pellet quality (P<0.001) and an increase (P<0.001) in total fines. Inclusion of DDGS decreased (P<0.001) energy usage at the pellet mill and decreased (P<0.05) bulk density of the diets. The DDGS levels fed during the starter phase (0 vs. 8%) had no effect on the broilers at 14 or at 28 d of age. Increasing DDGS inclusion levels during the grower phase resulted in a linear decrease (P<0.001) in BW gain and liver relative weight (P<0.001). A DDGS starterxgrower interaction (P<0.05) was observed for feed consumption, in which birds that consumed no DDGS during the starter phase exhibited a decrease in feed consumption with the higher inclusion levels of DDGS during the grower phase, whereas birds that received 8% DDGS during the starter phase were unaffected by DDGS inclusion level in the grower phase. Feed conversion, mortality, ileal viscosity, and cecal C. perfringens and E. coli concentrations were unaffected by DDGS level in the grower diet. The feed intake response suggests a beneficial effect of exposing broiler chicks to DDGS if inclusion levels of 22.5% or higher are to be fed after 14 d of age. However, the data suggest that the young broiler can be negatively affected with inclusion levels of 15% DDGS or higher up to 28 d of age.
TI  - Galactoglucomannan oligosaccharide supplementation affects nutrient digestibility, fermentation end-product production, and large bowel microbiota of the dog.
AB  - A galactoglucomannan oligosaccharide (GGMO) obtained from fiberboard production was evaluated as a dietary supplement for dogs. The GGMO substrate contained increased concentrations of oligosaccharides containing mannose, xylose, and glucose, with the mannose component accounting for 35% of DM. Adult dogs assigned to a 6 x 6 Latin square design were fed 6 diets, each containing a different concentration of supplemental GGMO (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8%) that replaced dietary cellulose. Total tract DM and OM apparent digestibilities increased (P < 0.001) linearly, whereas total tract CP apparent digestibility decreased (P < 0.001) linearly as dietary GGMO substrate concentration increased. Fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and total short-chain fatty acids increased (P </= 0.001) linearly, whereas butyrate concentration decreased (P </= 0.001) linearly with increasing dietary concentrations of GGMO. Fecal pH decreased (P </= 0.001) linearly as dietary GGMO substrate concentration increased, whereas fecal score increased quadratically (P </= 0.001). Fecal phenol (P </= 0.05) and indole (P </= 0.01) concentrations decreased linearly with GGMO supplementation. Fecal biogenic amine concentrations were not different among treatments except for phenylethylamine, which decreased (P < 0.001) linearly as dietary GGMO substrate concentration increased. Fecal microbial concentrations of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus spp., and Clostridium perfringens were not different among treatments. A quadratic increase (P </= 0.01) was noted for Bifidobacterium spp. as dietary GGMO substrate concentration increased. The data suggest positive nutritional properties of supplemental GGMO when incorporated in a good-quality dog food.
TI  - Recombinant expression of two bacteriophage proteins that lyse clostridium perfringens and share identical sequences in the C-terminal cell wall binding domain of the molecules but are dissimilar in their N-terminal active domains.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium capable of producing four major toxins that are responsible for disease symptoms and pathogenesis in a variety of animals, humans, and poultry. The organism is the third leading cause of human foodborne bacterial disease, and C. perfringens is the presumptive etiologic agent of necrotic enteritis among chickens, which in the acute form can cause increased mortality among broiler flocks. Countries that have complied with the ban on antimicrobial growth promoters (AGP) in feeds have had increased incidences of C. perfringens-associated necrotic enteritis in poultry. To address this issue, new antimicrobial agents, putative lysins from the genomes of bacteriophages, are identified. Two putative phage lysin genes (ply) from the clostridial phages phiCP39O and phiCP26F were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli , and the resultant proteins were purified to near homogeneity. Gene and protein sequencing revealed that the predicted and chemically determined amino acid sequences of the two recombinant proteins were homologous to N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases. The proteins were identical in the C-terminal putative cell-wall binding domain, but only 55% identical to each other in the presumptive N-terminal catalytic domain. Both recombinant lysins were capable of lysing both parental phage host strains of C. perfringens as well as other strains of the bacterium in spot and turbidity reduction assays. The observed reduction in turbidity was correlated with up to a 3 log cfu/mL reduction in viable C. perfringens on brain-heart infusion agar plates. However, other member species of the clostridia were resistant to the lytic activity by both assays.
TI  - Effects of bilayer composition and physical properties on the phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin.
AB  - alpha-Toxin, a major determinant of Clostridium perfringens toxicity, exhibits both phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase activities. Our studies with large unilamellar vesicles containing a variety of lipid mixtures reveal that both lipase activities are enhanced by cholesterol and by lipids with an intrinsic negative curvature, e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine. Conversely lysophospholipids, that possess a positive intrinsic curvature, inhibit the alpha-toxin lipase activities. Phospholipids with a net negative charge do not exert any major effect on the lipase activities, and the same lack of effect is seen with the lysosomal lipid bis (monoacylglycero) phosphate. Ganglioside GT1b has a clear inhibitory effect, while the monosialic ganglioside GM3 is virtually ineffectual even when incorporated at 6mol % in the vesicles. The length of the lag periods appears to be inversely related to the maximum (post-lag) enzyme activities. Moreover, and particularly in the presence of cholesterol, lag times increase with pH. Both lipase activities are sensitive to vesicle size, but in opposite ways: while phospholipase C is higher with larger vesicles, sphingomyelinase activity is lower. The combination of our results with previous structural studies suggests that alpha-toxin lipase activities have distinct, but partially overlapping and interacting active sites.
TI  - A 17-year review of foodborne outbreaks: describing the continuing decline in England and Wales (1992-2008).
AB  - Systematic national surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks effectively serves the development of public health policy on food safety. The Health Protection Agency has maintained a collaborative surveillance system for foodborne outbreaks in England and Wales since 1992. Up to 2008, 2429 foodborne outbreaks were identified, described and analysed for changes over time. Salmonella spp. accounted for half of the outbreaks, although the proportion of these decreased over the surveillance period. Similarly, the proportion of outbreaks caused by Clostridium perfringens decreased, while those attributed to Campylobacter spp. and Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 increased. Although poultry meat was the most frequently implicated food vehicle in outbreaks followed by miscellaneous foods and red meats, the proportion of outbreaks attributed to meats in fact decreased over time but those linked to miscellaneous foods did not. Over the surveillance period, the proportion of outbreaks linked to eggs and S. Enteritidis non-phage-type 4, particularly in food service establishments, increased, highlighting the importance of this organism/setting/vehicle association. Contributory factors in most outbreaks were cross-contamination, inadequate heat treatment, and inappropriate food storage. This study describes the overall decline in foodborne outbreaks, providing evidence that the introduction and adherence to effective control measures provide the best means of minimizing the risk of foodborne infection.
TI  - Functional and structural characterization of soluble recombinant epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens D, causative agent of enterotoxaemia.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens types B and D are responsible for enterotoxaemia, one of  the major causes of cattle mortality and is therefore of great economic concern. The epsilon toxin produced by the organism is the major antigenic determinant and has been directly implicated for the disease causation. In the present paper, we evaluated the biological activity of the recombinant epsilon toxin (rEtx) produced as soluble protein in Escherichia coli. The rEtx was purified to near homogeneity by a one-step anion-exchange chromatography. The immunological identity of purified rEtx was confirmed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the native toxin. The rEtx formed heptamer in the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and synaptosomal membrane of mouse brain and was cytotoxic to the MDCK cells with a CT(50) of 30 ng/ml. The rEtx was highly stable and its thermostability profile related well with its biological activity. The rEtx was purified in large amounts and exhibited all the properties of native toxin and therefore can be used for the development of vaccine against the pathogen.
TI  - Potency against enterotoxemia of a recombinant Clostridium perfringens type D epsilon toxoid in ruminants.
AB  - Enterotoxemia, a disease that affects domestic ruminants, is caused mainly by the epsilon toxin from Clostridium perfringens type D. Its eradication is virtually impossible, control and prophylaxis are based on systematic vaccination of herds with epsilon toxoids that are efficient in inducing protective antibody production. The use of recombinant toxins is one of the most promising of these strategies. This work evaluates the potency of a Cl. perfringens type D epsilon toxoid expressed by Escherichia coli administered to goats, sheep, and cattle. The etx gene was cloned into the pET-11a plasmid of E. coli strain BL21 to produce the recombinant toxin. Rabbits (n=8), goats, sheep, and cattle (n=5 for each species) were immunized with 0.2mg of the insoluble recombinant protein fraction to evaluate vaccine potency of the epsilon toxoid studied. Antibody titers were 40, 14.3, 26, and 13.1 IU/mL in the rabbit, goat, sheep, and cattle serum pools, respectively. The epsilon toxoid produced and tested in this work is adequate for immunization of ruminants against enterotoxemia.
TI  - Implications of faecal indicator bacteria for the microbiological assessment of roof-harvested rainwater quality in southeast Queensland, Australia.
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the suitability of Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens for assessing the microbiological quality of roof-harvested rainwater and assessing whether the concentrations of these faecal indicators can be used to predict the presence or absence of specific zoonotic bacterial or protozoan pathogens. From a total of 100 samples tested, 58%, 83%, and 46% of samples were found to be positive for, respectively, E. coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens spores, as determined by traditional culture-based methods. Additionally, in the samples tested, 7%, 19%, 1%, 8%, 17%, and 15% were PCR positive for Aeromonas hydrophila lip, Campylobacter coli ceuE, Campylobacter jejuni mapA, Legionella pneumophila mip, Salmonella invA, and Giardia lamblia beta-giardin genes, respectively. However, none of the samples was positive for E. coli O157 lipopolysaccharide, verocytotoxin 1, and verocytotoxin 2 and Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst wall protein genes. The presence or absence of these potential pathogens did not correlate with any of the faecal indicator bacterial concentrations as determined by a binary logistic regression model. The roof-harvested rainwater samples tested in this study appeared to be of poor microbiological quality, and no significant correlation was found between the concentration of faecal indicators and pathogenic microorganisms. The use of faecal indicator bacteria raises questions regarding their reliability in assessing the microbiological quality of water and particularly their poor correlation with pathogenic microorganisms. The presence of one or more zoonotic pathogens suggests that the microbiological analysis of water should be performed and that appropriate treatment measures should be undertaken, especially in tanks where the water is used for drinking.
TI  - Escherichia coli and enterococci are sensitive and reliable indicators for human, livestock and wildlife faecal pollution in alpine mountainous water resources.
AB  - AIMS: This study evaluated the applicability of standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) for alpine mountainous water resources monitoring. METHODS AND RESULTS: Escherichia coli, enterococci (ENTC) and Clostridium perfringens were investigated by standard or frequently applied phenotypic and genotypic methods in a broad range of animal and human faecal sources in a large alpine mountainous area. Clostridium perfringens occurred only in human, livestock and carnivorous source groups in relevant average concentrations (log 4.7-7.0CFU g(-1) ) but not in herbivorous wildlife sources. Escherichia coli proved to be distributed in all faecal source groups with remarkably balanced average concentrations (log 7.0-8.4CFU g(-1) ). Except for single faecal samples from the cattle source group, prevalence rates for ENTC source groups were generally >87% with average concentrations of log 5.3-7.7 CFUg(-1) . To test the faecal indication capacity in the environment, faecal prevalence data were comparatively analysed with results from the concurrently performed multi-parametric microbial source tracking effort on karst spring water quality from the investigated alpine mountainous catchment (Reischer et al. 2008; Environ Microbiol 10:2598-2608). CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli and enterococci are reliable faecal indicators for alpine mountainous water resources monitoring, although E. coli is the more sensitive one. Clostridium perfringens did not prove to be an indicator of general faecal pollution but is suggested a conservative microbial source tracking marker for anthropogenic faecal influence. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Applicability of SFIB is currently hotly debated. This is the first study providing comprehensive information on the applicability of SFIB at alpine mountainous habitats.
TI  - Clostridial dermatitis and cellulitis: an emerging disease of turkeys.
AB  - Clostridial dermatitis of turkeys (CDT) has emerged as a major issue across most  geographic regions of the United States. The prevalence and severity of dermatitis has increased over the last several years, since the time it was first reported in 1993. Cellulitis in poultry can be associated with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, but the more recent field situation in turkeys is specifically associated with Clostridium spp. The prevalence of cellulitis is relatively low; however, the disease can be devastating in the individual flocks affected. Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sordelli, and S. aureus can cause cellulitis. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., and other bacteria have occasionally been isolated from birds diagnosed with cellulitis. CDT appears as excessive mortality in older birds around 16-18 weeks of age. It has been reported from field experience as early as 7 wk of age. Clinical signs of CDT can range from sudden death to inappetence, depression, leg weakness, recumbency, and ataxia. The disease is characterized by reddish to dark or greenish discoloration of the skin around the thighs, abdomen, keel, tail region, back, and wings. The lesions can extend into the underlying muscles, and there can be gas bubbles under the skin which result in crepitation. Some cases present with dead birds having "bubbly tail," fluid-filled blisters associated with broken feather follicles around the base of the tail. Bubbly tail in breeder toms might not cause excessive mortality, but the lesions are so severe that the birds cannot be used for semen collection. Incidence of mortality from this condition can be severe and acute (i.e., rapid onset of high mortality). The dead birds decompose very quickly. Microscopically, there is necrosis, with or without inflammation of the skin, especially in the dermis and occasionally in the skeletal muscles, associated with large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria. Overcrowding, aggressive birds, poor-wet litter, decreased down time, a contaminated environment including feed and water, poor hygienic conditions, and contaminated vaccines and vaccine equipment, etc., can predispose birds for CDT. Preventative measures and treatment are discussed extensively in this review.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - Growth performance, meat quality, and gut microflora of broiler chickens fed with cranberry extract.
AB  - Cranberry fruit components have been reported to have antimicrobial activities against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and to be beneficial for human health. Studies on their effects are very limited in animals and especially in chickens. This study investigated the effect of feed supplementation with a commercial cranberry fruit extract (CFE) on the performance, breast meat quality, and intestinal integrity of broiler chickens. Twelve hundred male 1-d-old broiler chicks were allocated randomly to CFE treatments at 0, 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg of feed from d 0 to 35. Cloacal and cecal samples were collected weekly to evaluate the influence of treatments on the intestinal population of generic Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. At d 35, BW were 1.62, 1.60, 1.61, and 1.64 kg for the control birds and birds fed 40, 80, and 160 mg of CFE/kg of feed, respectively. Feed intake ranged from 2.7 to 2.8 kg and feed efficiency from 1.8 to 1.9 g of feed/g of BW. However, the treatment effects on bird performance were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The mortality rate tended to be lower (P = 0.09) in birds fed 40 mg of CFE/kg of feed. Feed supplementation with CFE did not significantly alter any broiler meat properties evaluated when compared with the control diet (P > 0.05). At d 28, the populations of Enterococcus spp. in cecal and cloacal samples were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in birds receiving CFE at 160 mg/kg of feed than the other groups. No significant differences were noted between the control and the treatment groups for general health and intestinal integrity (P > 0.05). These findings suggest that more studies are needed to investigate potential beneficial effects of CFE or its derivatives in broiler production.
TI  - Identification and sequence determination of recombinant Clostridium perfringens  alpha-toxin by use of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
AB  - Only a few methods exist for simple, sensitive and rapid detection of alpha-toxin in clinical and biological samples. The aim of our study was to establish a procedure for the production of an antibody against a recombinant antigen with confirmed sequence identity. We applied a noble approach based on proteomics using a mass spectrometer for the conclusive identification of the recombinant alpha-toxin that was subsequently used as an antigen. The recombinant alpha-toxin was produced in Escherichia coli. A clinical isolate of Clostridium perfringens GAI 94074 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently, cloning was performed. Three different fragments were cloned using a pET100/D-TOPO vector. These fragments coded for a ribosome binding site, a signal peptide and the alpha-toxin gene, respectively. Recombinant pET100 plasmids were cloned into TOP 10 cells and the isolated plasmids were transferred into BL21 Star (DE3) cells. Their expression was then induced with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Recombinant E. coli transformed with a plasmid encoding the alpha-toxin gene alone produced a biologically inactive protein. On the other hand, E. coli carrying the plasmid encoding the toxin sequence and its native signal peptide sequence, or the toxin sequence along with the ribosome binding sequence and the signal peptide sequence secreted an active alpha-toxin with phospholipase activity. Accordingly, the C. perfringens gene encoding the alpha-toxin protein along with its signal peptide was successfully cloned, expressed, and secreted by E. coli. Furthermore, without consideration of its activity, we used mass spectrometry to confirm that the expressed protein was indeed the alpha-toxin. Thus, the identification of alpha-toxin protein using both the biological activity testing and the mass spectrometry analysis is expected to verify the significant production of C. perfringens antibody. The study for the analysis of recombinant alpha-toxin using ESI/MS has not been reported. In this study, we report the successful cloning, expression, secretion, identification and sequence determination of the C. perfringens alpha-toxin.
TI  - Dietary cellulose, fructooligosaccharides, and pectin modify fecal protein catabolites and microbial populations in adult cats.
AB  - Twelve young adult (1.7 +/- 0.1 yr) male cats were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design to determine the effects of fiber type on nutrient digestibility, fermentative end products, and fecal microbial populations. Three diets containing 4% cellulose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), or pectin were evaluated. Feces were scored based on the 5-point system: 1 being hard, dry pellets, and 5 being watery liquid that can be poured. No differences were observed (P > 0.100) in intake of DM, OM, CP, or acid-hydrolyzed fat; DM or OM digestibility; or fecal pH, DM%, output on an as-is or DM basis, or concentrations of histamine or phenylalanine. Crude protein and fat digestibility decreased (P = 0.079 and 0.001, respectively) in response to supplementation with pectin compared with cellulose. Both FOS and pectin supplementation resulted in increased fecal scores (P < 0.001) and concentrations of ammonia (P = 0.003) and 4-methyl phenol (P = 0.003). Fecal indole concentrations increased (P = 0.049) when cats were supplemented with FOS. Fecal acetate (P = 0.030), propionate (P = 0.035), and total short-chain fatty acid (P = 0.016) concentrations increased in pectin-supplemented cats. Fecal butyrate (P = 0.010), isobutyrate (P = 0.011), isovalerate (P = 0.012), valerate (P = 0.026), and total branched-chain fatty acids + valerate (P = 0.008) concentrations increased with supplementation of FOS and pectin. Fecal cadaverine (P < 0.001) and tryptamine (P < 0.001) concentrations increased with supplementation of FOS and pectin. Fecal tyramine concentrations decreased (P = 0.039) in FOS-supplemented cats, whereas spermidine concentrations increased (P < 0.001) in pectin-supplemented cats. Whereas fecal concentrations of putrescine (P < 0.001) and total biogenic amines (P < 0.001) increased with FOS and pectin, the concentrations of these compounds were increased (P < 0.001) in cats supplemented with pectin. Fecal Bifidobacterium spp. concentrations increased (P = 0.006) and Escherichia coli concentrations decreased (P < 0.001) in FOS-supplemented cats. Fecal concentrations of Clostridium perfringens (P < 0.001), E. coli (P < 0.001), and Lactobacillus spp. (P = 0.030) also increased in pectin-supplemented cats. In addition to increasing populations of protein-fermenting microbiota, pectin increased production of fermentative end products associated with carbohydrate compared with protein fermentation. Pectin and FOS may be useful fiber sources in promoting intestinal health of the cat.
TI  - Web of ecological interactions in an experimental gut microbiota.
AB  - The dynamics of all ecosystems are dictated by intrinsic, density-dependent mechanisms and by density-independent environmental forcing. In spite of the importance of the gastrointestinal microbiota in health and disease, the ecology of this system remains largely unknown. Here, we take an ecological approach to gut microbial community analysis, with statistical modelling of time series data from chemostats. This approach removes effects of host forcing, allowing us to describe a network of intrinsic interactions determining the dynamic structure of an experimental gut microbiota. Surprisingly, the main colonization pattern in this simplified model system resembled that of the human infant gut, suggesting a potentially important role of density-dependent interactions in the early gut microbiota. Knowledge of ecological structures in microbial systems may provide us with a means of controlling such systems by modifying the strength and nature of interactions among microbes and between the microbes and their environment.
TI  - Exogenous lysozyme influences Clostridium perfringens colonization and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens.
AB  - Necrotic enteritis is a worldwide poultry disease caused by the overgrowth of Clostridium perfringens in the small intestine. An experiment with a 2x2 factorial design (supplementation with or without 40 mg lysozyme/kg diet for chickens challenged with or without C. perfringens) was conducted to investigate the inhibitory efficacy of exogenous lysozyme against intestinal colonization by C. perfringens in chickens subject to oral inoculation of C. perfringens type A on days 17 to 20. The C. perfringens challenge resulted in significant increase of C. perfringens, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus populations in the ileum, bacteria translocation to the spleen, the intestinal lesion scores , There was significantly lower intestinal lysozyme activity in the duodenum and jejunum and weight gain during days 14 to 28 of the experiment. The addition of exogenous lysozyme significantly reduced the concentration of C. perfringens in the ileum and the intestinal lesion scores, inhibited the overgrowth of E. coli and Lactobacillus in the ileum and intestinal bacteria translocation to the spleen, and improved intestinal lysozyme activity in the duodenum and the feed conversion ratio of chickens. These findings suggest that exogenous lysozyme could decrease C. perfringens colonization and improve intestinal barrier function and growth performance of chickens.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the bioactive compound beauvericin produced by Fusarium proliferatum on solid medium of wheat.
AB  - To obtain the bioactive compound beauvericin (BEA), Fusarium proliferatum CECT 20569 was grown on a solid medium of wheat, utilizing the technique of the solid state fermentation (SSF), being this mycotoxin purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse phase semi-preparative column using as the mobile phase acetonitrile/water in gradient condition. The purity of the BEA was verified by analytical HPLC and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The pure fractions of BEA were utilized to determinate the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract as: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  - The effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, pH, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. Although several isolates of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and the Bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of Escherichia coli, Collinsela aerofaciense, Eubacterium limosum, and Clostridium perfringens could not. When fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. After the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus including Enterococcus tended to increase. However, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including C. perfringens, decreased (p < 0.05), and Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas tended to decrease. Moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. The fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p < 0.05) on apple intake. These findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  - A wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. The objective of this study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. Using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium and Bacillus were studied for inhibition of Clostridium perfringens type A, various serovars of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, as well as Brachyspira pilosicoli. Strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without pH neutralization, proteinase K and catalase treatment. Enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus amylovorus and Bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. The Bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-Brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. Homofermentative lactobacilli and B. thermophilum could suppress the growth of B. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to L. reuteri and L. mucosae had no effect. The lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one Enterococcus faecium and L. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. The findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of hemO encoding heme oxygenase in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen, Clostridium perfringens, causes clostridial myonecrosis or gas gangrene in humans by producing numerous extracellular toxins and enzymes that act in concert to degrade host tissues. The ability of infectious bacteria to acquire sufficient iron during infection is essential for the pathogen to cause disease. In the C. perfringens strain 13 genome, a heme oxygenase gene homologue (CPE0214, hemO) was found and its role was examined. The purified recombinant HemO protein showed heme oxygenase activity that can convert heme to biliverdin. hemO transcription was induced in response to extracellular hemin in a dose-dependent manner. The global two-component VirR/VirS regulatory system and its secondary regulator VR-RNA had positive regulatory effects on the transcription of hemO. These data indicate that heme oxygenase may play important roles in iron acquisition and cellular metabolism, and that the VirR/VirS-VR-RNA system is also involved in the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis, which might be important for the survival of C. perfringens in a human host.
TI  - Validation of a numerical indicator of microbial contamination for karst springs.
AB  - Rapid changes in spring water quality in karst areas due to rapid recharge of bacterially contaminated water are a major concern for drinking water suppliers and users. The main objective of this study was to use field experiments with fecal indicators to verify the vulnerability of a karst spring to pathogens, as determined by using a numerical modeling approach. The groundwater modeling was based on linear storage models that can be used to simulate karst water flow. The vulnerability of the karst groundwater is estimated using such models to calculate criteria that influence the likelihood of spring water being affected by microbial contamination. Specifically, the temporal variation in the vulnerability, depending on rainfall events and overall recharge conditions, can be assessed and quantified using the dynamic vulnerability index (DVI). DVI corresponds to the ratio of conduit to diffuse flow contributions to spring discharge. To evaluate model performance with respect to predicted vulnerability, samples from a spring were analyzed for Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and heterotrophic plate count bacteria during and after several rainfall events. DVI was shown to be an indication of the risk of fecal contamination of spring water with sufficient accuracy to be used in drinking water management. We conclude that numerical models are a useful tool for evaluating the vulnerability of karst systems to pathogens under varying recharge conditions.
TI  - Presence of zoonotic pathogens in physico-chemically characterized manures from hog finishing houses using different production systems.
AB  - Hog production has been intensified in Eastern Canada, by 50% over the last 20years. Wastes are now managed with conventional production systems (slatted floor), litter systems or source separation systems. We studied the presence of total and fecal coliforms, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the manure of all of these production systems. The concentrations of the studied zoonotic pathogens did not differ between the conventional and the litter systems investigated. The source separation system yielded separated solid and liquid fractions. Total and fecal coliforms, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were found in the solids and the liquid fractions of a source separation system.Campylobacter species were not detected in the liquid fractions. Zoonotic pathogens are therefore, found in the manure of Eastern Canadian hog finishing houses equipped either with conventional, sawdust litter or source separation systems. Pathogens inactivation will require changes in manure management practices or the use of manure disinfection methods.
TI  - Bacteriological characterization of wastewater samples obtained from a primary treatment system on a small scale swine farm.
AB  - This study was carried out in order to quantify enteric bacteria and identify the presence of Salmonella spp., Escherichiacoli, Clostridiumperfringens and Erysipelothixrhusiopathiae in the liquid fraction of excreta generated from a small scale swine farm by means of a primary treatment system, consisting of the separation of solids and the sedimentation of liquids. Samples were collected at the following stages of the treatment: collection basin (CB), liquid obtained from a solids separator (SLF) and liquid from the sedimentation basin (SB). In each sample, enteric bacteria (cfu/g wet weight) and E. coli were quantified, Salmonella spp. was isolated and typified, and C. perfringens, and E. rhusiopathiae were isolated. No significant differences (p>0.05) were found in the enteric bacteria and E. coli population levels at any treatment stage. S.choleraesuis was found in 20% of CB samples analyzed, 40% of SLF samples and 30% of SB samples. C. perfringens was isolated from SLF and SB. E. rhusiopathiae was not isolated (below the minimum detection limit). Results suggest that primary treatment does not reduce the amount of enteric bacteria, or eliminate Salmonella spp., E. coli and C. perfringens. Therefore, it is necessary to apply additional treatments to allow safe use of the liquid obtained in the farm.
TI  - Expanding the family of collagen proteins: recombinant bacterial collagens of varying composition form triple-helices of similar stability.
AB  - The presence of the (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) open reading frames in different bacteria predicts the existence of an expanded family of collagen-like proteins. To further explore the triple-helix motif and stabilization mechanisms in the absence of hydroxyproline (Hyp), predicted novel collagen-like proteins from Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. Soluble proteins capable of successful folding and in vitro refolding were observed for collagen proteins from Methylobacterium sp 4-46, Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Solibacter usitatus . In contrast, all protein constructs from Clostridium perfringens were found predominantly in inclusion bodies. However, attachment of a heterologous N-terminal or C-terminal noncollagenous folding domain induced the Clostridium perfringens collagen domain to fold and become soluble. The soluble constructs from different bacteria had typical collagen triple-helical features and showed surprisingly similar thermal stabilities despite diverse amino acid compositions. These collagen-like proteins provide a resource for the development of biomaterials with new properties.
TI  - EtfA catalyses the formation of dipicolinic acid in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Dipicolinic acid (DPA) is a major component of bacterial endospores, comprising 5-15% of the spore dry weight, and is important for spore stability and resistance properties. The biosynthetic precursor to DPA, dihydro-dipicolinic acid (DHDPA), is produced by DHDPA synthase within the lysine biosynthesis pathway. In Bacillus subtilis, and most other bacilli and clostridia, DHDPA is oxidized to DPA by the products of the spoVF operon. Analysis of the genomes of the clostridia in Cluster I, including the pathogens Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, has shown that no spoVF orthologues exist in these organisms. DPA synthase was purified from extracts of sporulating C. perfringens cells. Peptide sequencing identified an electron transfer flavoprotein, EtfA, in this purified protein fraction. A C. perfringens strain with etfA inactivated is blocked in late stage sporulation and produces < or = 11% of wild-type DPA levels. C. perfringens EtfA was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, and this protein catalysed DPA formation in vitro. The sequential production of DHDPA and DPA in C. perfringens appears to be catalysed by DHDPA synthase followed by EtfA. Genome sequence data and the taxonomy of spore-forming species suggest that this may be the ancestral mechanism for DPA synthesis.
TI  - Presence of pathogens and indicator microbes at a non-point source subtropical recreational marine beach.
AB  - Swimming in ocean water, including ocean water at beaches not impacted by known point sources of pollution, is an increasing health concern. This study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south Florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. Twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. The analyses performed included analyses of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers (human polyomaviruses [HPyVs] and Enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (Vibrio vulnificus, Staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.). The enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative PCR were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. The FIB concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and MST markers were also generally undetectable. The FIB levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one event, and this was accompanied by detection of HPyVs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium V. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans Giardia spp. in water, and detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. The elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. Additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.
TI  - Prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens in racing sled dogs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is highly prevalent in racing sled dogs, although the underlying causes are poorly understood. HYPOTHESIS: Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile Toxin A and B are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs. ANIMALS: One hundred and thirty-five sled dogs. METHODS: Freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. Samples were visually scored for diarrhea, mucus, blood, and melena. CPE and C. difficile Toxin A and B were detected by ELISA. Samples were cultured for C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157; Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. were detected via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. Salmonella was isolated from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. C. perfringens and C. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. Dogs were more likely to test positive for CPE during than before racing (18.8 versus 5.5%, P = .021); however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly associated with hematochezia or diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Sled dogs participating in long distance racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not associated with common enteropathogens. It is possible that diarrhea and hematochezia represent the effect of prolonged exercise on the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Expression, purification and crystallization of an archaeal-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase.
AB  - An archaeal-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PepcA) from Clostridium perfringens has been expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form with an amino-terminal His tag. The recombinant protein is enzymatically active and two crystal forms have been obtained. Complete diffraction data extending to 3.13 angstrom resolution have been measured from a crystal soaked in KAu(CN)(2), using radiation at a wavelength just above the Au L(III) edge. The asymmetric unit contains two tetramers of PepcA.
TI  - Physiological role of carbon dioxide in spore germination of Clostridium perfringens S40.
AB  - Germination of Clostridium perfringens is known to be triggered by nutrients such as l-alanine and inosine, and facilitated by CO2, however the role of CO2 has not been fully understood. During the studies of the germination-specific protease GSP, we found that CO2 could be replaced by bicarbonate or weakly acidic pH (pH 6.0-6.5). We also found that the spores obtained from the C. perfringens S40 overproducing GSP could germinate without CO2. Moreover, the spores could germinate in the absence of nutrients, when the spores were incubated with bicarbonate or under weakly acidic pH. GSP, which might consist of three homologous proteases, CspA, CspB, and CspC, is one of the key enzymes involved in the spore germination, and converts the pre-mature form of the spore cortex-lytic enzyme, SleC, to the mature form. Maturation of SleC in the spores obtained from the mother strain of C. perfringens S40 requires nutrients plus bicarbonate or weakly acidic pH. In contrast, mature SleC was found in the spores obtained from the cells overpoducing GSP, when the spores were treated by nutrients, bicarbonate or weakly acidic pH. Each nutrients, bicarbonate and weakly acidic pH can trigger the germination of the spores obtained from C. perfringens cells overproducing GSP.
TI  - Characterization of selected nutrients and bacteria from anaerobic swine manure lagoons on sow, nursery, and finisher farms in the Mid-South USA.
AB  - Swine (Sus scrofa domestica) production in the Mid-South USA comprises sow, nursery, and finisher farms. A 2007 packing plant closure started a regional shift from finisher to sow and nursery farms. Changes in manure stored in lagoons and land-applied as fertilizer were expected but were unknown because nutrient and bacterial levels had not been characterized by farm type. The objectives of this study were to quantify selected nutrients and bacteria, compare levels by farm types, and project impacts of production shifts. Nutrients and bacteria were characterized in 17 sow, 10 nursery, and 10 finisher farm lagoons. Total and thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli (Migula) Castellani and Chalmers, Enterococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens (Veillon and Zuber) Hauduroy et al., Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., and Salmonella spp. were evaluated. Highest levels were from total coliforms (1.4- 5.7x10(5) cfu 100 mL(-1)), which occurred with E. coli, Campylobacter spp., C. perfringens, and Enterococcus spp., in every lagoon and virtually every sample. Lowest levels were from Listeria spp. and Salmonella spp. (<or=1.3x10(2) most probable number [MPN] 100 mL(-1)), detected in 81 and 89% of lagoons and 68 and 64% of samples, respectively. Sow farm levels were higher for all except Listeria spp. and Salmonella spp., which were lower (1.4x10(1) and 2.8x10(1) MPN 100 mL(-1), respectively) and only slightly below their respective levels from nursery farms (1.1x10(2) and 3.4x10(1) MPN 100 mL(-1)). Shifting from finisher to nursery farm would not affect bacterial levels, but shifting to sows would. Either shift would reduce NPK and N:P and suggest modification of nutrient management plans.
TI  - Immunization of broiler chickens against Clostridium perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis using purified recombinant immunogenic proteins.
AB  - This study identified and assessed secreted proteins of Clostridium perfringens additional to those previously described for their ability to protect broiler chickens against necrotic enteritis (NE). Secreted proteins of virulent and avirulent C. perfringens were electrophoretically separated and reacted with serum of chickens immune to NE. Three immunoreactive protein bands unique to the virulent C. perfringens were identified by mass spectrometry as the toxin C. perfringens large cytotoxin (TpeL), endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Naglu), and phosphoglyceromutase (Pgm). The genes encoding Naglu and Pgm proteins were cloned, and their gene products were purified as histidine-tagged recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli and used in immunizing chickens. Immunized and nonimmunized control broiler chickens were then challenged with two different strains (CP1, CP4) of C. perfringens and assessed for the development of NE. Of the two immunogens, Pgm immunization showed significant protection of broiler chickens against experimental NE, although protection reduced as challenge severity increased. However, birds immunized with Naglu were protected from challenge only with strain CP4. Birds immunized with these proteins had antigen-specific antibodies when tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the partial efficacy of additional secreted proteins in immunity of broiler chickens to NE. The study also showed that there may be differences in the protective ability of immunogens depending on the infecting C. perfringens strain.
TI  - Influence of enrichment broths on multiplex PCR detection of total coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, in spiked water samples.
AB  - Although multiplex PCR amplification condition for simultaneous detection of total coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens in water sample has been developed, results with high sensitivity are obtained when amplifying purified DNA, but the sensitivity is low when applied to spiked water samples. An enrichment broth culture prior PCR analysis increases sensitivity of the test but the specific nature of enrichment broth can affect the PCR results. Three enrichment broths, lactose broth, reinforced clostridial medium and fluid thioglycollate broth, were compared for their influence on sensitivity and on time required with multiplex PCR assay. Fluid thioglycollate broth was the most effective with shortest enrichment time and lowest detection limit.
TI  - The effect of Grobiotic-P combined with yeast cell wall and gluconic acid on growth performance, nutrient digestibilities, and cecal microbial populations in young chicks.
AB  - Two experiments were conducted with New Hampshire x Columbian chicks fed a corn-soybean meal diet to examine the efficacy of varying levels and combinations of Grobiotic P (GB), a prebiotic-type product that contains dairy and yeast fractions and dried fermentation extracts, gluconic acid, and yeast cell wall (YCW) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and cecal microbial populations. In experiment 1, chicks were allowed ad libitum access to a corn-soybean meal basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 2 or 4% GB, 1.5 or 3% gluconic acid, 0.2% YCW, or various 2-way combinations of the supplements in place of dextrose and arenaceous flour. In experiment 2, the same supplement combinations were used as in experiment 1; however, the 3% gluconic acid supplement was eliminated. In both experiments, supplementing GB, YCW, or 1.5% gluconic acid to the diet had no consistent effect on growth performance except that the weight gain was depressed (P < 0.05) when the chicks were fed a diet containing 3% gluconic acid. Chicks fed diets containing 2 or 4% GB combinations showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in ME(n) at 21 d when compared with chicks fed the basal diet. For amino acid (AA) digestibility, 2% GB combined with 0.2% YCW or 1.5% gluconic acid resulted in a reduction (P < 0.05) in AA digestibility at 7 d; however, at 21 d, these combinations increased (P < 0.05) digestibility of all AA. There was no consistent effect of dietary treatment on cecal bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, Escherichia coli, or Clostridium perfringens populations or cecal pH. These experiments indicated that diets containing GB generally increased ME(n) and AA digestibility at 21 d and that the prebiotic combinations had no consistent effects on cecal microbial populations.
TI  - Microbiological quality of saffron from the main producer countries.
AB  - A microbiological study of saffron spice was undertaken in the context of a European research project (Methodologies for Implementing International Standards for Saffron Purity and Quality, the acronym for which is SAFFIC), analyzing 79 samples obtained from the main producer countries, namely Greece, Iran, Italy, Morocco, and Spain. Current microbiological quality criteria are the same as for other spices, but saffron is added in minute quantities during the cooking process, so the health risk associated with microbial contamination might be lower. We did not detect Salmonella either by culture or by PCR methods in any sample, and Escherichia coli was only found in five samples. Enterobacteriaceae were frequently found (70.9% of the samples), but most of them belonged to species of probable environmental origin. Aerobic sporulated bacteria were also common, but only three samples contained Bacillus cereus at low levels (<200 CFU g(-1)). Clostridium perfringens counts were also very low, with only one sample reaching >100 CFU g(-1), an acceptable value. Overall, microbial contamination in saffron was markedly lower than it was in other spices.
TI  - Prevalence, prediction and risk factors of enteropathogens in normal and non-normal faeces of young Dutch dairy calves.
AB  - Between January and April 2007, 424 calves under 22 days of age from 108 Dutch dairy herds were sampled to estimate the prevalence of non-normal faeces ('custard-like'-yellowish-coloured with custard consistency or diarrhoea: watery-like faeces) and the shedding of enteropathogens Escherichia coli K99 (E. coli), Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum), Rotavirus and Clostridium perfringens (Cl. perfringens). In addition, information was collected on animal characteristics and herd-management practices. The probability of detecting each one of five enteropathogens given a calf with 'custard-like' faeces or diarrhoea was estimated using Bayes' rule and was based on the predicted probabilities from a multinominal model including each of five enteropathogens as independent variables. In addition, putative risk factors for the presence of each of five enteropathogens were analysed using logistic regression models with random herd effects. Fifty-seven percent of calves had faeces of normal colour (brownish) and consistency (firm), 23.8% (95%CI: 19.8-28.2%) had 'custard-like' faeces and 19.1% (95%CI: 15.5-23.2%) had diarrhoea. E. coli was the least detected enteropathogen (2.6% (95%CI: 1.3-4.6%) of calves, 9% (95%CI: 5-16%) of herds) and Cl. perfringens was most detected (54.0% (95%CI: 49.1-58.8%) of calves, 85% (95%CI: 77-91%) of herds). E. coli and Coronavirus were detected incidentally in only one or two calves per herd, whereas C. parvum and Cl. perfringens were frequently detected in up to four calves per herd. For calves with 'custard-like' faeces, the probability of detecting Rotavirus from a calf in its first week of age was 0.31 whereas for a calf in its second week, there was a 0.66 probability of detecting C. parvum. The probabilities of detecting E. coli, Rotavirus and C. parvum in calves with diarrhoea in their first week of age were 0.10, 0.20 and 0.43, respectively. In calves with diarrhoea between 1 and 2 weeks of age, the probability of detecting enteropathogens was 0.43 for C. parvum. None of the tested enteropathogens were related to 'custard-like' faeces or diarrhoea in the third week of age. Putative risk factors for E. coli, Coronavirus and C. parvum included the presence of peer-calves shedding Coronavirus, C. parvum or Rotavirus, respectively. Additionally, managerial risk factors such as non-optimal hygienic housing (for Coronavirus) and the routine use of antibiotics for diarrhoeic calves (for C. parvum) were found. No animal or managerial factors were associated with shedding of Cl. perfringens.
TI  - Comparison of molecular markers to detect fresh sewage in environmental waters.
AB  - Human-specific Bacteroides HF183 (HS-HF183), human-specific Enterococci faecium esp (HS-esp), human-specific adenoviruses (HS-AVs) and human-specific polyomaviruses (HS-PVs) assays were evaluated in freshwater, seawater and distilled water to detect fresh sewage. The sewage spiked water samples were also tested for the concentrations of traditional fecal indicators (i.e., Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens) and enteric viruses such as enteroviruses (EVs), sapoviruses (SVs), and torquetenoviruses (TVs). The overall host-specificity of the HS-HF183 marker to differentiate between humans and other animals was 98%. However, the HS-esp, HS-AVs and HS-PVs showed 100% host-specificity. All the human-specific markers showed >97% sensitivity to detect human fecal pollution. E. coli, enterococci and, C. perfringens were detected up to dilutions of sewage 10(-5), 10(-4) and 10(-3) respectively. HS-esp, HS-AVs, HS-PVs, SVs and TVs were detected up to dilution of sewage 10(-4) whilst EVs were detected up to dilution 10(-5). The ability of the HS-HF183 marker to detect fresh sewage was 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the HS-esp and viral markers. The ability to detect fresh sewage in freshwater, seawater and distilled water matrices was similar for human-specific bacterial and viral marker. Based on our data, it appears that human-specific molecular markers are sensitive measures of fresh sewage pollution, and the HS-HF183 marker appears to be the most sensitive among these markers in terms of detecting fresh sewage. However, the presence of the HS-HF183 marker in environmental waters may not necessarily indicate the presence of enteric viruses due to their high abundance in sewage compared to enteric viruses. More research is required on the persistency of these markers in environmental water samples in relation to traditional fecal indicators and enteric pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of septicaemia and severe bacterial infections in foals with a new cefquinome formulation: a field study.
AB  - A multicentre field study was conducted in accordance with VICH Guideline on Good Clinical Practice (VICH 2000) to confirm the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of cefquinome for the treatment of naturally occurring severe bacterial infections and septicaemia in foals. Thirty-nine foals suffering from severe bacterial infections (such as pneumonia, gastro-enteritis, arthritis, omphalitis, or wound infections) or acute septicaemia were treated twice daily with the test product (1 mg cefquinome/kg body weight) intravenously for three days and then intramuscularly for three to 11 days. Investigators examined the foals daily and scored both systemic and local clinical signs to assess the response to treatment, treatment success and relapses. On the day of inclusion a blood sample was taken from each foal for IgG determination and blood culture. In case of abnormal clinical findings additional samples were taken for bacteriology. Treatment was successful in 87.2% of cases (34 of 39 foals) and no relapses were observed. The average duration of treatment was 7.5 days. At inclusion, bacterial culture was positive in 40.5% (15 out of 37) of the blood cultures. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus spp. were the most common isolates and were all susceptible to cefquinome. E. coli predominated in swabs from umbilical and open wound infections, and in rectal swabs E. coli. There was no correlation between IgG at inclusion and study outcome or treatment duration. The test product was very well tolerated by all of the foals following intravenous and intramuscular injection. The cefquinome formulation tested was effective and safe in the treatment of severe bacterial infections and septicaemia in foals under field conditions.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activities of Sinapis alba L. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. longum, Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and L. casei. The active component of S. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and HPLC and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. The antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. Phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of C. difficile and C. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. Furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of E. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and E. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. In conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Comparison between the Vitek Immunodiagnostic Assay System and PCR for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms in an experimental dry sausage during its curing process.
AB  - The comparison between the Vitek Immunodiagnostic Assay System (VIDAS) and PCR methods for the detection of the pathogenic microorganisms Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus in salchich6n (a type of Spanish fermented dry sausage) was studied. The automated mini-VIDAS method and the PCR method were used to detect the presence of these microorganisms in 90 samples grouped into six batches (one control batch, and five batches inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, S. aureus, and C. perfringens, respectively). The determinations were carried out on fresh sausage, semicured (14 days), and finished product (28 days of curing). The concordance between both methods was 100%. For salchichon-type sausage samples, both the VIDAS method and PCR (in comparison to traditional methods) permit a significant reduction in the time required for the detection of the pathogens assayed. The absence of Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, their enterotoxins, and C. perfringens were verified in the control batch. Conversely, for batches inoculated with these pathogens, the results were positive in the fresh sausage up to 14 days of curing and in the finished product; this demonstrated the null or scant influence of the curing conditions and the constitutive lactic acid biota on the pathogens investigated.
TI  - Mammalian cell ganglioside-binding specificities of E. coli enterotoxins LT-IIb and variant LT-IIb(T13I).
AB  - LT-IIb, a type II heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli, is a potent immunologic adjuvant with high affinity binding for ganglioside GD1a. Earlier study suggested that LT-IIb bound preferentially to the terminal sugar sequence NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-3GalNAc. However, studies in our laboratory suggested a less restrictive binding epitope. LT-IIb(T13I), an LT-IIb variant, engineered by a single isoleucine-threonine substitution, retains biological activity, but with less robust inflammatory effects. We theorized that LT-IIb has a less restrictive binding epitope than previously proposed and that immunologic differences between LT-IIb and LT-IIb (T13I) correlate with subtle ganglioside binding differences. Ganglioside binding epitopes, determined by affinity overlay immunoblotting and enzymatic degradation of ganglioside components of RAW264.7 macrophages, indicated that LT-IIb bound to a broader array of gangliosides than previously recognized. Each possessed NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-3GalNAc, although not necessarily as a terminal sequence. Rather, each had a requisite terminal or penultimate single sialic acid and binding was independent of ceramide composition. RAW264.7 enterotoxin-binding and non-binding ganglioside epitopes were definitively identified as GD1a and GM1a, respectively, by enzymatic degradation and mass spectroscopy. Affinity overlay immunoblots, constructed to the diverse array of known ganglioside structures of murine peritoneal macrophages, established that LT-IIb bound NeuAc- and NeuGc-gangliosides with nearly equal affinity. However, LT-IIb(T13I) exhibited enhanced affinity for NeuGc-gangliosides and more restrictive binding. These studies further elucidate the binding epitope for LT-IIb and suggest that the diminished inflammatory activity of LT-IIb(T13I) is mediated by a subtle shift in ganglioside binding. These studies underscore the high degree of specificity required for ganglioside-protein interactions.
TI  - Dominant-negative inhibitors of the Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin is responsible for a severe, often lethal intoxication. In this study, we characterized dominant-negative inhibitors of the epsilon-toxin. Site-specific mutations were introduced into the gene encoding epsilon-toxin, and recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Paired cysteine substitutions were introduced at locations predicted to form a disulfide bond. One cysteine in each mutant was introduced into the membrane insertion domain of the toxin; the second cysteine was introduced into the protein backbone. Mutant proteins with cysteine substitutions at amino acid positions I51/A114 and at V56/F118 lacked detectable cytotoxic activity in a MDCK cell assay. Cytotoxic activity could be reconstituted in both mutant proteins by incubation with dithiothreitol, indicating that the lack of cytotoxic activity was attributable to the formation of a disulfide bond. Fluorescent labeling of the cysteines also indicated that the introduced cysteines participated in a disulfide bond. When equimolar mixtures of wild-type epsilon-toxin and mutant proteins were added to MDCK cells, the I51C/A114C and V56C/F118C mutant proteins each inhibited the activity of wild-type epsilon-toxin. Further analysis of the inhibitory activity of the I51C/A114C and V56C/F118C mutant proteins indicated that these proteins inhibit the ability of the active toxin to form stable oligomeric complexes in the context of MDCK cells. These results provide further insight into the properties of dominant-negative inhibitors of oligomeric pore-forming toxins and provide the basis for developing new therapeutics for treating intoxication by epsilon-toxin.
TI  - Enteric bacterial pathogen detection in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) is associated with coastal urbanization and freshwater runoff.
AB  - Although protected for nearly a century, California's sea otters have been slow to recover, in part due to exposure to fecally-associated protozoal pathogens like Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona. However, potential impacts from exposure to fecal bacteria have not been systematically explored. Using selective media, we examined feces from live and dead sea otters from California for specific enteric bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile and Escherichia coli O157:H7), and pathogens endemic to the marine environment (Vibrio cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and Plesiomonas shigelloides). We evaluated statistical associations between detection of these pathogens in otter feces and demographic or environmental risk factors for otter exposure, and found that dead otters were more likely to test positive for C. perfringens, Campylobacter and V. parahaemolyticus than were live otters. Otters from more urbanized coastlines and areas with high freshwater runoff (near outflows of rivers or streams) were more likely to test positive for one or more of these bacterial pathogens. Other risk factors for bacterial detection in otters included male gender and fecal samples collected during the rainy season when surface runoff is maximal. Similar risk factors were reported in prior studies of pathogen exposure for California otters and their invertebrate prey, suggesting that land-sea transfer and/or facilitation of pathogen survival in degraded coastal marine habitat may be impacting sea otter recovery. Because otters and humans share many of the same foods, our findings may also have implications for human health.
TI  - Mechanistic analysis of the blood group antigen-cleaving endo-beta-galactosidase  from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The A and B antigens are of vital importance in blood transfusion and organ transplantation. The specificity of EABase, an endo-beta-galactosidase from C. perfringens, toward the cleavage of A and B trisaccharides from glycoconjugates is unique and holds significant potential for use in modifying blood group antigens on cell surfaces. The mechanism of this enzyme and others in its family (GH98) and the identities of its catalytic residues have not previously been experimentally determined. Direct 1H NMR analysis of the hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate, DNP-beta-A-trisaccharide, by EABase revealed that EABase is an inverting endo-beta-galactosidase. Both activated and nonactivated substrates were used to kinetically characterize EABase and its mutants (E354A, D429A, D453A, E467A, and E506A) at pH 6.0, 37 degrees C. Hydrolysis of DNP-beta-A-trisaccharide by EABase follows normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent KM of 64 +/- 3 microM and a k(cat) of 105 +/- 5 min(-1). Mutation of two putative active site residues, D453 and E506, to alanine resulted in complete loss of activity, strongly suggesting that one or both of these residues functions as the base catalyst. The kinetic data also strongly suggest that E354 is the acid catalyst since the activity of the E354A mutant with nonactivated natural substrates is 1100-fold lower than that of the wild type enzyme, while its activity is only 10-fold lower when assayed with an activated aryl glycoside substrate (DNP-beta-A-trisaccharide). Further support is obtained through comparison of pH profiles for the wild type and E354A mutants: mutation of the acid catalyst eliminates the basic limb from the bell-shaped pH-dependence of k(cat)/KM seen for the wild type enzyme.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Removal of viruses and indicators by anaerobic membrane bioreactor treating animal waste.
AB  - Appropriate treatment of agricultural waste is necessary for the protection of public health in rural areas because land-applied animal manure may transmit zoonotic disease. In this study, we evaluated the potential of using a pilot anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) to treat agricultural waste. The AnMBR system, following a conventional complete mix anaerobic digester (CMAD), achieved high removals of biological and chemical agents. The mean log(10) removals of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and coliphage by the AnMBR were 5.2, 6.1, 6.4, and 3.7, respectively, and for the CMAD were 1.5, 1.2, 0.1, and 0.5, respectively. Compared with other indicators, coliphage was observed most frequently and had the highest concentration in effluent samples. Bovine adenoviruses and bovine polymaviruses (BPyV) were monitored in this study using nested PCR methods. All of the CMAD influent and CMAD effluent samples were positive for both viruses, and three AnMBR effluent samples were BPyV positive. The mean removals of total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphate, chemical oxygen demand, total solids, and volatile solids by the entire system were 31, 96, 92, 82, and 91%, respectively, but there was no removal of ammonium. When the AnMBR was operated independent of the CMAD, AnMBR achieved similar E. coli and enterococci removals as the combined CMAD/AnMBR system. The high quality of effluent produced by the pilot AnMBR system in this study demonstrated that such systems can be considered as alternatives for managing animal manure.
TI  - Rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  - AIM: To develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (RDB) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. METHODS: The 12 intestinal pathogens tested were Salmonella spp., Brucella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two universal primers were designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16S and 23S rDNA genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. Five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved RDB assay. RESULTS: The methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 CFUs. The consistent detection rate of the improved RDB assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. CONCLUSION: The hybridization results indicated that the improved RDB assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.
TI  - Dietary protein concentration affects intestinal microbiota of adult cats: a study using DGGE and qPCR to evaluate differences in microbial populations in the feline gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify qualitative and quantitative differences in microbial populations of adult cats fed diets containing different protein concentrations. Following a 4 week baseline period, eight healthy adult domestic short-hair queens (>1-year-old) were randomly allotted to a moderate-protein (MP; n = 4) or high-protein (HP; n = 4) diet for 8 weeks. Fresh faecal samples were collected after baseline and 8 weeks on treatment and stored at -80 degrees C. Following DNA extraction, samples were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to distinguish qualitative changes between diets. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure E. coli, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, and Lactobacillus populations. Compared to baseline, cats fed MP had a bacterial similarity index of 66.7% as opposed to 40.6% similarity for those fed HP, exhibiting marked changes in intestinal bacteria of cats fed HP. Bifidobacterium populations were greater (p < 0.05) in cats fed MP versus HP (9.44 vs. 5.63 CFU/g). Clostridium perfringens populations were greater (p < 0.05) in cats fed HP than MP (12.39 vs. 10.83 CFU/g). In this experiment, a high-protein diet resulted in a dramatic shift in microbial populations. Decreased Bifidobacterium population in cats fed HP may justify prebiotic supplementation for such diets.
TI  - GerO, a putative Na+/H+-K+ antiporter, is essential for normal germination of spores of the pathogenic bacterium Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The genome of the pathogen Clostridium perfringens encodes two proteins, GerO and GerQ, homologous to monovalent cation transporters suggested to have roles in the germination of spores of some Bacillus species. GerO and GerQ were able to transport monovalent cations (K(+) and/or Na(+)) in Escherichia coli, and gerO and gerQ were expressed only in the mother cell compartment during C. perfringens sporulation. C. perfringens spores lacking GerO were defective in germination with a rich medium, KCl, L-asparagine, and a 1:1 chelate of Ca(2+) and dipicolinic acid (DPA), but not with dodecylamine, and the defect was prior to DPA release in germination. All defects in gerO spores were complemented by ectopic expression of wild-type gerO. Loss of GerQ had much smaller effects on spore germination, and these effects were most evident in spores also lacking GerO. A modeled structure of GerO was similar to that of the E. coli Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NhaA, and GerO, but not GerQ contained two adjacent Asp residues thought to be important in the function of this group of cation transporters. Replacement of these adjacent Asp residues in GerO with Asn reduced the protein's ability to complement the germination defect in gerO spores but not the ability to restore cation transport to E. coli cells defective in K(+) uptake. Together, these data suggest that monovalent cation transporters play some role in C. perfringens spore germination. However, it is not clear whether this role is directly in germination or perhaps in spore formation.
TI  - Occurrence and levels of fecal indicators and pathogenic bacteria in market-ready recycled organic matter composts.
AB  - Landfill diversion of organic wastes through composting is making compost products available for agricultural and horticultural crops. On certified organic farms, nonsludge green waste and manure composts are widely used because the use of these products removes harvest date restrictions imposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture when raw manure is applied. We quantified several pathogens in point-of-sale composts from 94 nonsludge facilities processing 2.2 million m3 year(-1) of recycled green waste. Only one compost contained Salmonella (1.8 most probable number [MPN]/4 g), 28% had fecal coliforms exceeding the Environmental Protection Agency 503 sludge hygiene limits (1000 MPN g(-1)), and 6% had detectable Escherichia coli O157:H7. In 22 of 47 samples, very low levels of Listeria spp. were found. However, in one sample the Listeria level was very high, coinciding with the highest overall level of all pathogen indicators. Seventy percent of the compost samples were positive for Clostridium perfringens, but only 20% of the samples had levels >1000 CFU/g. All samples were positive for fecal streptococci, and 47% had >1000 MPN g(-1). Statistical analyses conducted using documented site characteristics revealed that factors contributing to elevated pathogen levels were large facility size, large pile size, and immaturity of compost. Application of the California Compost Maturity Index distinguished compost products that had very low levels of E. coli from those with high levels. Products produced with windrow methods were of higher microbiological quality than were those produced with static pile methods, and point-of-sale bagged composts scored very high. These data indicate that compost that is hygienic by common standards can be produced, but more effort is required to improve hygiene consistency in relation to management practices.
TI  - Seasonal relationships among indicator bacteria, pathogenic bacteria, Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, and hydrological indices for surface waters within an agricultural landscape.
AB  - The South Nation River basin in eastern Ontario, Canada is characterized by mixed agriculture. Over 1600 water samples were collected on a bi-weekly basis from up to 24 discrete sampling sites on river tributaries of varying stream order within the river basin between 2004 and 2006. Water samples were analyzed for: densities of indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, total and fecal coliforms), the presence of pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp.), and densities of parasite Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts. Relationships between indicator bacteria, pathogens, and parasite oocysts/cysts were overall weak, seasonally dependent, site specific, but primarily positive. However, L. monocytogenes was inversely related with indicator bacteria densities. Campylobacter, Salmonella, Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were most frequently detected in the fall. E. coli O157:H7 was detected at a very low frequency. Exploratory decision tree analyses found overall that E. coli densities were the most utilitarian classifiers of parasite/pathogen presence and absence, followed closely by fecal coliforms, and to a lesser extent enterococci and total coliforms. Indicator bacteria densities that classified pathogen presence and absence groupings, were all below 100 CFU per 100 mL(-1). Microorganism relationships with rainfall indices and tributary discharge variables were globally weak to modest, and generally inconsistent among season, site and microorganism. But, overall rainfall and discharge were primarily positively associated with indicator bacteria densities and pathogen detection. Instances where a pathogen was detected in the absence of a detectable bacterial indicator were extremely infrequent; thus, the fecal indicators were conservative surrogates for a variety of pathogenic microorganisms in this agricultural setting. The results from this study indicate that no one indicator or simple hydrological index is entirely suitable for all environmental systems and pathogens/parasites, even within a common geographic setting. These results place more firmly into context that robust prediction and/or indicator utility will require a more firm understanding of microorganism distribution in the landscape, the nature of host sources, and transport/environmental fate affinities among pathogens and indicators.
TI  - Nitrogen, phosphorus, and bacteria tile and groundwater quality following direct  injection of dewatered municipal biosolids into soil.
AB  - Application of municipal biosolids (sewage) to agricultural land is a common practice to improve soil physical quality and fertility. The chosen method of land application can have a strong impact on the extent of adjacent water contamination by nutrients and bacteria. Dewatered municipal biosolids (DMB) were applied to silt-clay loam experimental field plots in Ontario, Canada using two application methods: (i) surface spreading followed by shallow incorporation (SS) and (ii) a newly developed implement that directly injects DMB into the topsoil (DI). The objective of this study was to compare N, P, and bacteria quality of tile drainage and shallow groundwater associated with each land application technique. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in N, P, and bacteria tile mass loads among the application treatments for time periods <100 d postapplication, when the greatest peak loads and peak tile water concentrations were observed. Both land application treatments caused groundwater Escherichia coli contamination to at least 1.2 m depth below surface after the first postapplication rainfall event, and NO(3)-N contamination to at least 2.0 m depth below surface. The DI treatment did, however, have significantly (P < 0.05) higher tile mass loads of total Kjeldahl N (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), E. coli, Enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens relative to the SS treatment for time periods >100 d postapplication. Nevertheless, relative to tile effluent data collected <100 d postapplication (no application treatment differences), peak loads, and concentrations during this time were, overall, considerably lower for both treatments. This finding, along with no significant differences in N, P, and bacteria groundwater concentrations among the application treatments, and that the direct injection technique could potentially reduce vector attraction problems and odor, suggests that the direct injection technique should be considered a dewatered municipal biosolid land application option.
TI  - Characterization of two putative fibronectin-binding proteins of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen that causes gas gangrene and food poisoning in humans and animals. Genomic analysis of C. perfringens strain 13 revealed that this bacterium contains two genes (CPE0737 and CPE1847) that encode putative fibronectin (Fn)-binding proteins (Fbps). These genes, named fbpA and fbpB, were found to be constitutively expressed in all three strains (13, NCTC8237, CPN50) of C. perfringens, isolated from gas gangrene of human, that were tested. Both fbpA and fbpB were cloned and His-tagged, recombinant FbpA (rFbpA) and recombinant FbpB (rFbpB) were purified by Ni(2+)-Sepharose column chromatography from transformed Escherichia coli. These recombinant Fbps were shown to bind to Fn, purified from human serum, in a ligand blotting assay. Additionally, Fn bound to these rFbps in a dose-dependent manner in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, it was found that pre-incubation of Fn with either rFbpA or rFbpB inhibited the binding of Fn to C. perfringens cells.
TI  - Screening Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridium perfringens as indicator organisms in evaluating pathogen-reducing capacity in biogas plants.
AB  - This study was conducted to identify an indicator organism(s) in evaluating the pathogen-reducing capacity of biogas plants. Fresh cow manure containing 10(4) to 10(5) colony forming unit (CFU) per milliliter of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis along with an inoculated Clostridium perfringens strain were exposed to 37 degrees C for 15 days, 55 degrees C for 48 h, and 70 degrees C for 24 h. C. perfringens was the most heat-resistant organism followed by E. faecalis, while E. coli was the most heat-sensitive organism. E. coli was reduced below detection limit at all temperatures with log(10) reductions of 4.94 (10 s), 4.37 (40 min), and 2.6 (5 days) at 70 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 37 degrees C, respectively. Maximum log(10) reductions for E. faecalis were 1.77 at 70 degrees C (1 day), 1.7 at 55 degrees C (2 days) and 3.13 at 37 degrees C (15 days). For C. perfringens, maximum log(10) reduction at 37 degrees C was 1.35 log(10) units (15 days) compared to less than 1 unit at 55 and 70 degrees C. Modeling results showed that E. faecalis and C. perfringens had higher amount of heat-resistant fraction than E. coli. Thus, E. faecalis and C. perfringens can be used as indicator organisms to evaluate pathogen-reducing capacity in biogas plants at high temperatures of 55 degrees C and 70 degrees C while at 37 degrees C E. coli could also be included as indicator organism.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools in Wales, United Kingdom.
AB  - A survey of the general microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools was undertaken across Wales, United Kingdom. Of the 2,351 samples taken, four were identified as containing unsatisfactory counts of Escherichia coli, four contained unsatisfactory counts of Staphylococcus aureus, and one contained an unacceptable count of Bacillus cereus when compared with guidelines for the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food published by the United Kingdom Public Health Laboratory Service in 2000. No samples contained detectable levels of Salmonella, Listeria species, or Clostridium perfringens. When compared with data on the general microbiological quality of food available in Wales, the food sampled from schools was of relatively better microbiological quality.
TI  - Investigation of bioaerosols released from swine farms using conventional and alternative waste treatment and management technologies.
AB  - Microbial air pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) has raised concerns about potential public health and environmental impacts. We investigated the levels of bioaerosols released from two swine farms using conventional lagoon-sprayfield technology and ten farms using alternative waste treatment and management technologies in the United States. In total, 424 microbial air samples taken at the 12 CAFOs were analyzed for several indicator and pathogenic microorganisms, including culturable bacteria and fungi, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, bacteriophage, and Salmonella. At all of the investigated farms, bacterial concentrations at the downwind boundary were higher than those at the upwind boundary, suggesting that the farms are sources of microbial air contamination. In addition, fecal indicator microorganisms were found more frequently near barns and treatmenttechnology sites than upwind or downwind of the farms. Approximately 4.5% (19/424), 1.2% (5/424), 22.2% (94/424), and 12.3% (53/424) of samples were positive for fecal coliform, E. coli, Clostridium, and total coliphage, respectively. Based on statistical comparison of airborne fecal indicator concentrations at alternative treatment technology farms compared to control farms with conventional technology, three alternative waste treatment technologies appear to perform better at reducing the airborne release of fecal indicator microorganisms during on-farm treatment and management processes. These results demonstrate that airborne microbial contaminants are released from swine farms and pose possible exposure risks to farm workers and nearby neighbors. However, the release of airborne microorganisms appears to decrease significantly through the use of certain alternative waste management and treatment technologies.
TI  - Demonstration of passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis following immunization of pregnant heifers at 3 months of gestation.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is one of the primary etiologic agents for diarrhea in neonatal calves. Immunization of dams can provide passive protection in neonatal calves; antibodies transferred through colostrum block colonization of bacteria, thereby preventing disease. In this study, healthy pregnant heifers were vaccinated at approximately 3 months of gestation with either a polyvalent oil-adjuvanted vaccine containing inactivated coronavirus, rotavirus, E. coli K99 subunit antigen, and Clostridium perfringens b and e toxoid or normal saline as a placebo. Calves were allowed to nurse immediately after birth, were orally challenged with virulent heterologous enterotoxigenic E. coli at 1 day of age, and were observed for clinical signs of scours for 10 days. Signs of severe scours were noted in 75% of control calves and 28.6% of vaccinates, and the severity of scours was significantly higher (P = .0382) in the control group. The mortality rate was significantly higher (P = .0007) in the control group (80%) than in the vaccinate group (14%). These findings indicate that the vaccination of pregnant heifers at as early as 3 months of gestation (6 months before calving) provides passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis.
TI  - Auranofin disrupts selenium metabolism in Clostridium difficile by forming a stable Au-Se adduct.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen whose incidence and importance are on the rise. Previous work in our laboratory characterized the central role of selenoenzyme-dependent Stickland reactions in C. difficile metabolism. In this work we have identified, using mass spectrometry, a stable complex formed upon reaction of auranofin (a gold-containing drug) with selenide in vitro. X-ray absorption spectroscopy supports the structure that we proposed on the basis of mass-spectrometric data. Auranofin potently inhibits the growth of C. difficile but does not similarly affect other clostridia that do not utilize selenoproteins to obtain energy. Moreover, auranofin inhibits the incorporation of radioisotope selenium ((75)Se) in selenoproteins in both Escherichia coli, the prokaryotic model for selenoprotein synthesis, and C. difficile without impacting total protein synthesis. Auranofin blocks the uptake of selenium and results in the accumulation of the auranofin-selenide adduct in the culture medium. Addition of selenium in the form of selenite or L-selenocysteine to the growth medium significantly reduces the inhibitory action of auranofin on the growth of C. difficile. On the basis of these results, we propose that formation of this complex and the subsequent deficiency in available selenium for selenoprotein synthesis is the mechanism by which auranofin inhibits C. difficile growth. This study demonstrates that targeting selenium metabolism provides a new avenue for antimicrobial development against C. difficile and other selenium-dependent pathogens.
TI  - Regional differences in bacterial flora in harbour porpoises from the North Atlantic: environmental effects?
AB  - AIMS: Microbiological findings in harbour porpoises from different regions of the North Atlantic were compared. Results in animals from the North and Baltic Seas were evaluated over a period of 18 years for changes in the microbiological flora. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbiological investigations were performed on 1429 organ samples from the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes from harbour porpoises of the German North and Baltic Seas, Greenlandic, Icelandic and Norwegian waters. A large variety of bacteria, including potentially pathogenic bacteria like Brucella sp., Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. Those bacteria were associated with bronchopneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis, myocarditis and septicemia. CONCLUSIONS: Organs from animals originating from Greenlandic and Icelandic waters showed clearly less bacterial growth and fewer associated pathological lesions compared to animals from the German North and Baltic Seas and Norwegian waters. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Differences in bacterial findings and associated lesions between harbour porpoises from the German North and Baltic Seas and animals from Greenlandic, Norwegian and Icelandic waters may result from higher stress due to anthropogenic activities such as chemical pollutants in the North and Baltic Seas.
TI  - Enumeration of some cultivable bacterial groups and characterization of some abiotic variables in the jejunoileal content of Prim'Holstein veal calves.
AB  - A study was conducted to characterize the bacterial and biochemical composition of the jejunoileal content of veal calves and the effect of pre-slaughter fasting time. At 22 wk of age, 22 preruminant Prim'Holstein calves fed milk replacer and pellets (mainly composed of corn) were slaughtered at 6, 12, or 24 h after their last meal. Chyme samples were collected from the jejunoileal compartment just after slaughter, and pH and redox potential were immediately measured. Culture-based methods were used to determine the concentrations of total anaerobic microflora, lactate-utilizing bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group, Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, Enterococci, and 2 potential pathogenic species, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of l-lactate, ammonia, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were determined on frozen samples. The biochemical composition (DM, total protein, lactose, galactose, glucose, minerals, AA profile, and fatty acid profile) of the jejunoileal content was determined only on samples from the 6-h fasted group. Microflora concentrations were greater (P < 0.01) in the 6-h fasted group compared with the 12- and 24-h fasted groups, involving a decreased pH (P < 0.05) and greater lactate and SCFA concentrations, both linked directly to the fermentative state of the microorganisms. The 6-h fasted group showed the least interanimal variability in bacterial group levels, except for Cl. perfringens, which presented increased interanimal variability regardless of fasting time. At 6 h postprandial, the jejunoileal content of veal calves seemed to be in a stable state, allowing the creation of a database on its biochemical composition. This study is a key first step in the development of an in vitro system for modeling the jejunoileal ecosystem of veal calves. This model will provide a useful tool for assessing the effects of feed additives on intestinal microflora.
TI  - Tight junctions as targets of infectious agents.
AB  - The epithelial barrier is a critical border that segregates luminal material from entering tissues. Essential components of this epithelial fence are physical intercellular structures termed tight junctions. These junctions use a variety of transmembrane proteins coupled with cytoplasmic adaptors, and the actin cytoskeleton, to attach adjacent cells together thereby forming intercellular seals. Breaching of this barrier has profound effects on human health and disease, as barrier deficiencies have been linked with the onset of inflammation, diarrhea generation and pathogenic effects. Although tight junctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhea. Understanding the strategies that microorganisms use to commandeer the functions of tight junctions is an active area of research in microbial pathogenesis. In this review we highlight and overview the tactics bacteria and viruses use to alter tight junctions during disease. Additionally, these studies have identified novel tight junction protein functions by using pathogens and their virulence factors as tools to study the cell biology of junctional structures.
TI  - The effects of several organic acids on growth performance, nutrient digestibilities, and cecal microbial populations in young chicks.
AB  - Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of citric, gluconic, fumaric, and malic acids on growth and nutrient digestibility in New Hampshire x Columbian male chicks from hatch to 21 d. For growth performance, chicks fed 1 to 4% gluconic acid, 4% citric acid, or 4% malic acid in a corn-soybean meal diet generally showed reductions (P < 0.05) in growth to 21 d, whereas 3% citric acid, 2% malic acid, or 1.5 to 4.5% fumaric acid had no significant effect. In the first experiment, 2, 4, and 6% gluconic acid increased ME(n) values at 7, 14, and 21 d, but in experiment 2, 1 and 2% gluconic acid decreased ME(n) at 4 and 7 d, but had no effect at 14 and 21 d. The 4% level of citric acid increased ME(n) at 4 d. Digestibility of most amino acids (AA) was reduced by gluconic acid in some treatments, whereas citric acid (3%) increased AA digestibility at 4 d but not at 21 d. For cecal microbial populations at 21 d, bifidobacteria were reduced when 2% gluconic acid and 3% citric acid were fed to chicks in a corn-soybean meal diet, whereas 4% gluconic acid had no effect when fed in a dextrose-casein diet to chicks. In a dextrose-isolated soy protein diet, 4% gluconic acid reduced the cecal populations of Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens. The results of this study indicated that feeding organic acids did not have any consistent effects on growth performance, ME(n), AA digestibility, or cecal microbial numbers.
TI  - Assessment of the microbiological safety of dried spices and herbs from production and retail premises in the United Kingdom.
AB  - A study of dried spices and herbs from retail and production premises to determine the microbiological status of such products was undertaken in the UK during 2004. According to EC Recommendation 2004/24/EC and European Spice Association specifications, 96% of 2833 retail samples and 92% of 132 production batches were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. Salmonella spp. were detected in 1.5% and 1.1% of dried spices and herbs sampled at production and retail, respectively. Overall, 3.0% of herbs and spices contained high counts of Bacillus cereus (1%, > or =10(5) cfu g(-1)), Clostridium perfringens (0.4%, > or =10(3) cfu g(-1)) and/or Escherichia coli (2.1%, > or =10(2) cfu g(-1)). Ninety percent of samples examined were recorded as being 'ready-to-use', 96% of which were of satisfactory/acceptable quality. The potential public health risk of using spices and herbs as an addition to ready-to-eat foods that potentially undergo no further processing is therefore highlighted in this study. Prevention of microbial contamination in dried herbs and spices lies in the application of good hygiene practices during growing, harvesting and processing from farm to fork, and effective decontamination. In addition, the importance of correct food handling practices and usage of herbs and spices by end users cannot be overemphasised.
TI  - Microbial quality control of raw ground beef and fresh sausage in Casablanca (Morocco).
AB  - In this study, samples of raw ground beef (n = 150) and fresh sausage (n = 100) were collected randomly from butcheries, supermarkets, and fast-food shops, in Casablanca, Morocco. Two types of meat product samples were considered, one with spices (n = 115) and other without spices (n = 135). All the samples were analyzed for the presence of the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes. E. coli strains were further typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Operon O, and characterized for virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results indicated that counts of E. coli, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, and C. perfringens were 17%, 9.6%, and 8.7% in samples without spices, respectively; and 23.5%, 23.7%, and 29.6% in samples with spices, respectively. Two pathogenic genes, LT and EAST, were identified separately in four strains of E. coli. Salmonella and L. monocytogenes were isolated in 2.8% and 3.2% of the total samples, respectively.
TI  - [Construction and immunogenicity of a genetic engineered strain expressing nontoxic ST1-LT(B)-alpha-beta fusion protein against diarrhea of piglet].
AB  - We constructed a recombinant strain BL21 (DE3) (pETST3LTBalphabeta) including ST1-LT(B)-alpha-beta fusion gene via molecular technology. The SDS-PAGE and Western blotting indicated that the ST1-LT(B)-alpha-beta fusion protein was highly expressed in Escherichia coli and the molecular weight of the fusion protein was about 110 kD. The recombinant strain was induced in different concentrations of lactose and different aeration rate. The optimal culture conditions in 20 L fermentor were 1% inoculation (V/V), initial aeration 5 L/min, 0.03 mol/L lactose addition 3 hours after inoculation, and increased the aeration to 12.5 L/min for the following 6 hours. The fusion protein was about 38.53% of total cellular protein. It was nontoxic, immunogenic and protective against enterotoxigenic E. coli and Clostridium perfringens infection. The constructed recombinant strain BL21 (DE3) (pETST3LTBalphabeta) could serve as a candidate vaccine strain against diarrhea of piglet.
TI  - Fate of pathogenic microorganisms and indicators in secondary activated sludge wastewater treatment plants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and their indicators in a laboratory scale biological treatment system that simulated the secondary treatment process of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Four groups of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths as well as the selected indicators were employed in the investigation. The results demonstrated that approximately 2-3 log10 removal of the microbial indicators was achieved in the treatment process. The log removal of Clostridium perfringens spores was low due to their irreversible adsorption to sludge flocs. The laboratory treatment system demonstrated a similar removal capability for Escherichia coli and the bacterial indicators (total coliforms, enterococci and particles <2.73 microm/L). The MS-2 bacteriophage, measured as a viral indicator, showed a lower removal than poliovirus, which may be considered as a worst case scenario for virus removal. The results of using particle profiling as an indicator for protozoa and helminths appeared to be inaccurate. The removal performance for bacterial and protozoan pathogens and their indicators in a full scale WWTP and the laboratory treatment system was compared.
TI  - Understanding gastroenteritis in elderly residents of aged-care facilities.
AB  
TI  - Using irradiation treatment for reduction of anaerobic bacteria from a wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - This study was done to investigate the reduction of anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens) by ultrasound irradiation technology (USI). C. perfringens is the most important of the sulfite-reducing clostridia and is normally present in human and animal feces. Clostridial spores survive longer than coliforms, Escherichia coli or enterococci, and are consequently used as an indicator of past fecal pollution. The spores are not always inactivated by chlorination, but are not a hazard to health in potable water. C. perfringens are very resistant to chlorine and other drinking-water disinfectants. Conventional water treatment practices including chlorination are sometimes inadequate for inactivation of C. perfringens. Ultrasound irradiation is able to inactive C. perfringens through a number of physical and chemical effects arising from acoustic cavitation. The phenomenon of cavitation, which involves formation, growth, and violent collapse of vapour bubbles in a liquid media, is known to generate a high-intensity pressure, which affects the cell and C. perfringens' viability. Cavitations disrupt C. perfringens. Ultrasound irradiation at a frequency of 42 kHz was used to expose aqueous suspension of C. perfringens to evaluate the disinfection efficacy of ultrasound irradiation. Results indicated a significant increase in reduction of C. perfringens with increasing ultrasound time. C. perfringens was inactivated by 99.98% after 90 min.
TI  - Use of faecal pollution indicators to estimate pathogen die off conditions in source separated faeces in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal.
AB  - As the introduction and promotion of dehydrating toilets progresses, the safety of handling and reuse of their biosolids remains a question. A detailed study to understand the storage conditions and the fate of selected faecal indicators was conducted on four urine diverting dehydrating toilet units, using ash as a major additive, in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Presumptive Escherichia coli, total coliforms, enterococci and different fractions of Clostridium perfringens were investigated under field storage conditions. In addition, chemo-physical and chemical (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous content) parameters were investigated. Observed temperature was low in all the four toilets with a median of 24.0 degrees C, which was in the same range as the ambient temperature. pH was below the desired range of >9 and moisture level was very high (>60%). No single factor of the studied chemo-physical and chemical parameters could be found by statistical analysis to have accounted for the reduction of the indicators in any of the toilets. By time series analysis of the investigated strata in the faecal heaps (n=96), the determined reduction rate showed increasing persistence characteristics for E. coli, coliforms and enterococci with respective average log(10) reduction of -0.4, -0.3 and -0.2 per month (p<0.001). No significant reduction was observed for the different fractions of C. perfringens determined for the non-pasteurised and pasteurised fraction at 60 degrees C and 85 degrees C. 72% of randomly selected and analysed samples (n=36) were found to contain helminthes eggs. The used 6 months storage time did not prove sufficient to reach appropriate safety levels for handling and reuse of the biosolids.
TI  - Effects of mannanoligosaccharide and fructooligosaccharide on the response of broilers to pathogenic Escherichia coli challenge.
AB  - 1. The effects of mannanoligosaccharide (MOS, Bio-Mos, Alltech Inc.) on the growth performance and digestive system, particularly gut microflora, were tested and compared with fructooligosaccharide (FOS, Raftilose P95, Orafti) using 1-d-old birds in an Escherichia coli challenge model. The experiment lasted for 3 weeks and zinc bacitracin (ZnB) was used as a positive control. 2. Dietary MOS had positive effects on body weight gain (BWG) or/and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) of the challenged birds compared to the negative control at the end of weeks 1 and 3. Similar results were obtained for ZnB treatment. In contrast, FOS supplementation improved only the BWG of the challenged birds at 21 d of age. Within the unchallenged birds, a large improvement in BWG was noticed for FOS treatment at the end of the experiment, with the BWG of birds on ZnB and MOS treatments being intermediate. The FCE of the unchallenged birds was not affected by the dietary additives. 3. The addition of MOS reduced the number of mucosa-associated coliforms in the jejunum of the challenged birds on d 7. On d 21, FOS tended to increase the number of jejunal mucosa-associated lactobacilli in both the challenged and unchallenged birds. The number of Clostridium perfringens in the gut lumen was reduced by only ZnB. 4. Dietary MOS reduced the jejunal crypt depth of birds on d 7, regardless of the challenge. The FOS supplement did not affect the gut morphology, however, the concentration of lactic acid in the ileum was increased and, depending on the challenge, the intestinal pH was decreased by FOS at different ages. 5. In conclusion, the effects of MOS or FOS on the composition and activities of gut microflora and mucosal morphology of birds were related to E. coli challenge as well as the age of birds, which may be involved in the observed different growth-improving effects of the tested dietary additives.
TI  - Comparing the partitioning behavior of Giardia and Cryptosporidium with that of indicator organisms in stormwater runoff.
AB  - Microbial association with particles can significantly affect the fate and transport characteristics of microbes in aquatic systems as particle-associated organisms will be less mobile in the environment than their free phase (i.e. unattached) counterparts. As such, similarities or dissimilarities in the partitioning behavior of indicator organisms and pathogens may have an impact on the suitability of a particular indicator to act as a surrogate for a pathogen. This research analyzed the partitioning behavior of two pathogens (Cryptosporidium, Giardia) and several common indicator organisms (fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Clostridium perfringens spores, and coliphage) in natural waters under both dry and wet weather conditions. Samples were taken from several streams in two distinct sampling phases: (i) single grab samples; and (ii) intrastorm samples obtained throughout the duration of four storms. Partitioning behavior varied by microbial type, with 15-30% of bacterial indicators (fecal coliform, E. coli, and Enterococci) associated with settleable particles compared to 50% for C. perfringens spores. Both pathogens exhibited similar levels of particle association during dry weather (roughly 30%), with increased levels observed during wet weather events (Giardia to 60% and Cryptosporidium to 40%). The settling velocities of particle-associated microbes were also estimated, with those of the bacterial indicators (fecal coliform, E. coli, and Enterococci), as well as C. perfringens spores, being similar to that of the Giardia and Cryptosporidium, suggesting these organisms may exhibit similar transport behavior. With respect to intrastorm analysis, the highest microbial concentrations, in both particle-associated and free phase, occurred during the earlier stages of a storm. The total loadings of both indicators and pathogens were also estimated over the course of individual storms.
TI  - Molecular approach and bacterial quality of drinking water of urban and rural communities in Egypt.
AB  - Water is necessary to life so when supplied as drinking water to consumers, a satisfactory quality must be maintained. In Egypt, infectious intestinal diseases are the major cause of hospitalization in almost all regions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological quality of treated and untreated water samples from urban and rural communities. Thirty-five samples of treated (chlorinated) water from taps, 25 samples of bottled water and 15 samples of hand pump (untreated) water collected from different cities alongside the River Nile during the winter of 2007 were bacteriologically tested for safety as drinking water. This study indicated good quality of tap water and bottled water. The untreated water samples (hand pumps) were, however, slightly contaminated by faecal coliforms, faecal enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella and Shigella. Consequently, the consumers in the villages receiving water through hand pumps are often exposed to the risk of water-borne diseases due to inadequate treatment of the raw water. Therefore, there are guidelines necessary to protect groundwater quality. Moreover, PCR-amplified by some functional gene fragments such as dctA, dcuB, frdA, dcuS and dcuR genes of the E. coli was adapted for use as a non-cultivation-based molecular approach for detection of E. coli populations from water samples without the need for pure and identified cultures.
TI  - Indicator microorganisms and pathogens removal function performed by copepods in  constructed wetlands.
AB  - Removal efficiency of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms in constructed wetlands were analyzed, and microorganisms removal function performed by copepods was determined. The results showed that the constructed wetlands effectively reduced Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms, the Salmonella spp. removal efficiency was relatively low and the Clostridium perfringens removal was the least. At copepods concentrations of 3.0 x 10(2)/L, and 6.0 x 10(2)/L, high die-off rates were observed for indicator and pathogenic microorganisms compared to the control group, and indicator and pathogenic microorganisms in samples with higher concentration of copepods decreased much more rapidly than those in samples with lower concentration. These results suggest that predation by copepods is an important mechanism for the removal of bacteria in constructed wetlands.
TI  - The effects of Grobiotic-P on growth performance, nutrient digestibilities, and cecal microbial populations in young chicks.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Grobiotic-P (GB), a prebiotic-type product that contains dairy and yeast fractions and dried fermentation extracts, on growth performance and nutrient digestibility at 4 and 21 d of age and cecal populations of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens at 21 d of age. Two experiments were conducted using male New Hampshire x Columbian chicks. The first experiment evaluated GB at 2, 4, and 6% in a corn-soybean meal diet and compared these dietary treatments to a diet containing no GB (negative control) and a diet containing an antibiotic growth promoter (positive control), bacitracin methylene disalicylate. The second experiment used semi-purified dextrose-casein and dextrose-isolated soy protein diets to examine the effects of a 5% GB addition. In the first experiment, supplementing GB at 2, 4, and 6% in a corn-soybean meal diet had no effect on weight gain (P > 0.05). Feed efficiency and ME(n) were decreased (P < 0.05) by feeding 4 and 6% GB for some time periods, suggesting that the ME(n) value of GB used in diet formulation was too high. The GB had no consistent effect on apparent digestibility of amino acids. Cecal lactobacilli populations were linearly increased (P < 0.05) by GB in a corn-soybean meal diet in experiment 1. In the second experiment, the cecal populations of bifidobacteria were increased (P < 0.05) when 5% GB was supplemented to chicks fed a dextrose-casein diet, and the cecal populations of E. coli and C. perfringens were reduced (P < 0.05) when 5% GB was supplemented to chicks fed a dextrose-isolated soy protein diet. The results of this study indicate that feeding GB to chicks may promote the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria while reducing the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens in the ceca.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against foodborne bacterial strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of aqueous, methanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate extracts from edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against nine foodborne pathogenic bacterial strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, Shigella sonnei, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) was screened with a disk diffusion assay. Twenty-nine of the 48 species tested had antimicrobial activity. Methanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts accounted for 92.8% of the positive assays, whereas the hexane extracts accounted for only 7.2%. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than gram-negative bacteria to fungal extracts, and C. perfringens was the most sensitive microorganism. Aqueous extracts from Clitocybe geotropa and Lentinula edodes had the highest antimicrobial activity against all the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of oxidized cellulose salts.
AB  - Antimicrobial properties of oxidized cellulose and its salts in linters (-L) and  microsphere (-M) form (OKCEL H-L, OKCEL Zn-M, OKCEL ZnNa-L, OKCEL ZnNa-M and OKCEL Ag-L) were tested by a dilution method against a spectrum of microbial strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. OKCEL Ag-L exhibited antimicrobial activity in the range 0.1-3.5% w/v against all the bacteria and fungi involved in this study. Strong inhibition by OKCEL ZnNa-M was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis in the range 0.5-2.0% w/v. Antimicrobial effects of oxidized cellulose and its salts in textile form were investigated by a diffusion and dilution method against the spectrum of above-cited microbial strains extended by Clostridium perfringens. Generally, OKCEL Ag-T, OKCEL Zn-T and OKCEL H-T showed high antimicrobial activity against populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. OKCEL Zn-T was the only sample suppressing the growth of species.
TI  - Real-time PCR detection of pathogenic microorganisms in roof-harvested rainwater  in Southeast Queensland, Australia.
AB  - In this study, the microbiological quality of roof-harvested rainwater was assessed by monitoring the concentrations of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides spp. in rainwater obtained from tanks in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Samples were also tested using real-time PCR (with SYBR Green I dye) for the presence of potential pathogenic microorganisms. Of the 27 rainwater samples tested, 17 (63%), 21 (78%), 13 (48%), and 24 (89%) were positive for E. coli, enterococci, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides spp., respectively. Of the 27 samples, 11 (41%), 7 (26%), 4 (15%), 3 (11%), and 1 (4%) were PCR positive for the Campylobacter coli ceuE gene, the Legionella pneumophila mip gene, the Aeromonas hydrophila lip gene, the Salmonella invA gene, and the Campylobacter jejuni mapA gene. Of the 21 samples tested, 4 (19%) were positive for the Giardia lamblia beta-giardin gene. The binary logistic regression model indicated a positive correlation (P < 0.02) between the presence/absence of enterococci and A. hydrophila. In contrast, the presence/absence of the remaining potential pathogens did not correlate with traditional fecal indicators. The poor correlation between fecal indicators and potential pathogens suggested that fecal indicators may not be adequate to assess the microbiological quality of rainwater and consequent health risk.
TI  - Enteric bacteria isolated from acute diarrheal patients in the Republic of Korea  between the year 2004 and 2006.
AB  - In an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the Republic  of Korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. Among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic Escherichia coli, especially, EAEC was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Shigella species. Distinct seasonality was found in V. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed no age-specific patterns. However, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and B. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. However, both pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. Moreover, S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. In conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.
TI  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an Excel-based software program, Risk Ranger. It is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. Risk scores provided by the tool were characterized as low, medium and high. Also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. Low risk scores were obtained for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) for low risk population. High risk scores were obtained for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). Moderate risk scores for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). Scores for Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for S. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. Campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas Y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. High risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes (high risk population), EHEC (high risk population) or S. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with Campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and HEV (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). Salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. Preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. Only Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes and E. coli EHEC gave moderate risk ratings in case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. These results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a Food Safety Management System.
TI  - A national survey of the microbiological quality of retail raw meats in Australia.
AB  - A national survey of the microbiology of meat (ground beef and diced lamb) at the retail level in Australia was undertaken. For ground beef samples (n = 360), the mean aerobic plate count (APC) was 5.79 log CFU/g, and Escherichia coli was detected in 17.8% of samples; the mean population for these positive samples was 1.49 log CFU/g. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 96.9% of samples (mean for positive samples, 3.01 log CFU/g), and coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 28.1% of samples (mean for positive samples, 2.18 log CFU/g). For diced lamb samples (n = 360), the mean APC was 5.71 log CFU/g, and E. coli was detected in 16.7% of samples (mean for positive samples, 1.67 log CFU/g). Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 91.1% of samples (mean for positive samples, 2.85 log CFU/g), and coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 22.5% of samples (mean for positive samples, 2.34 log CFU/g). Salmonella was recovered from 4 (1.1%) of the 360 ground beef samples (isolates were Salmonella Typhimurium phage types), and E. coli O157 was recovered from 1 (0.3%) of 357 samples; Campylobacter and Clostridium perfringens were not recovered from any of the 91 and 94 samples tested, respectively. Salmonella was recovered from 2 (0.6%) of the 360 diced lamb samples (serovars were Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella Typhimurium), Campylobacter was recovered from 1 (1.1%) of 95 samples, and C. perfringens was recovered from 1 (1.1%) of 92 samples.
TI  - A comparison of efficiencies of microbiological pollution removal in six sewage treatment plants with different treatment systems.
AB  - Six sewage treatment plants (STP) were investigated over a 12-month period in order to measure the microbiological load of untreated municipal wastewater and to evaluate the removal efficiencies of different treatment systems. The STP investigated can be classified into three categories: bigger plants with tertiary treatment, smaller plants with enhanced secondary treatment, and very small compact facilities. The plants studied had a considerable quantitative impact on the hydrology of the catchment area; consequently, it was anticipated that the microbiological load of the effluent would also be significant. Eighty samples were taken from the influent and effluent of the STP, regardless of weather conditions, and several bacterial and two parasitological parameters were analysed. The average microbiological reduction of each STP was dependent on its capacity and treatment procedures and varied between 1.9 and 3.5log10. Small compact facilities had a significantly lower removal efficiency (2.0+/-1log10) and discharged treated wastewater with a poorer microbiological quality compared to larger plants with tertiary treatment or with enhanced secondary treatment (2.8log10). Final sand filtration and extensive intermediate settling considerably improved the overall microbiological removal efficiency. During the study period, the microbiological water quality of the receiving water course was not significantly impaired by the discharge of any of the investigated plants; however, the compact facilities showed critical treatment deficiencies. In particular, the reduction of Giardia cysts was insufficient (<1.5log10) compared to that of the bigger plants (>3.0log10). In order to quantify the overall impact of microbiological loads on the receiving watercourse in this catchment area, it is also necessary to assess the pollution from combined sewer overflow basins and diffuse pollution. This will be considered in subsequent studies.
TI  - Detection and characterization of an ABC transporter in Clostridium hathewayi.
AB  - An ABC transporter gene from Clostridium hathewayi is characterized. It has duplicated ATPase domains in addition to a transmembrane protein. Its deduced amino acid sequence has conserved functional domains with ATPase components of the multidrug efflux pump genes of several bacteria. Cloning this transporter gene into C. perfringens and E. coli resulted in decreased sensitivities of these bacteria to fluoroquinolones. It also decreased the accumulation and increased the efflux of ethidium bromide from cells containing the cloned gene. Carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) inhibited both accumulation and efflux of ethidium bromide from these cells. The ATPase mRNA was overexpressed in the fluoroquinolone-resistant strain when exposed to ciprofloxacin. This is the first report of an ABC transporter in C. hathewayi.
TI  - Effects of bovine lactoferrin on the immune system and the intestinal microflora  of adult dogs.
AB  - Eighteen Beagle dogs were used to evaluate the effects of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) on immune function and faecal microbial populations. The study comprised three feeding periods, each lasting four weeks. After an initial control Period 1, six dogs per group were supplemented with 0, 120 and 1800 mg bLF/kg dry diet, respectively (Period 2). In Period 3 dogs received again control diets. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets, lymphocyte proliferative response to concanavalin A, phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen and plasma IgA and IgG concentrations were analysed. The faecal concentrations of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were determined by cultural methods. Supplementation of bLF increased the number of monocytes, T cells and cytotoxic T cells in the blood and the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The leukocyte counts were not affected, except monocytes that increased after the supplementation with bLF. Plasma immunoglobulin concentrations were unchanged by treatment. Dogs supplemented with bLF tended to have lower faecal concentrations of E. coli and Clostridium perfringens. In conclusion, bLF seems to alter indices of the cellular immune response and faecal microbial populations of healthy adult dogs.
TI  - Interaction of isoquinoline alkaloid palmatine with deoxyribonucleic acids: binding heterogeneity, and conformational and thermodynamic aspects.
AB  - The binding heterogeneity, conformational aspects, and energetics of the interaction of the cytotoxic plant alkaloid palmatine have been studied with various natural and synthetic DNAs. The alkaloid binds to calf thymus and Escherichia coli DNA that have mixed AT and GC sequences in almost equal proportions with positive cooperativity, while, with Clostridium perfringens and Micrococcus lysodeikticus DNA with predominantly high AT and GC sequences, respectively, noncooperative binding was observed. On further investigation with synthetic DNAs, the binding was observed to be cooperative with polymers like poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dG).poly(dC) having poly(purine)poly(pyrimidine) sequences, while with polymers poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT), poly(dA-dC).poly(dG-dT) and poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), which have alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences, a non-cooperative binding phenomenon was observed. This suggests the binding heterogeneity of palmatine to the two types of sequences of base pairs. Circular dichroism (CD) studies revealed that the binding induced conformational changes in all the DNAs, but more importantly, the bound alkaloid molecules acquired induced optical activity, and the extent was dependent on the AT content and showed AT base-pair specificity. Energetics of the interaction of the alkaloid studied by highly sensitive isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the binding was in most cases exothermic and favored by both enthalpy and entropy changes, while, in the case of the homo and hetero AT polymers, the same was predominantly entropy-driven. This study defines base-pair-dependent heterogeneity, conformational aspects, and energetics of palmatine binding to DNA.
TI  - Large-scale freshwater microbiological study: rationale, results and risks.
AB  - A fifteen-month fortnightly survey of microbial health risk indicators and pathogens has been carried out at 25 freshwater recreational and water supply sites distributed throughout New Zealand, for: E. coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, F-RNA bacteriophage, somatic coliphage, human enteroviruses, human adenoviruses, Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Sites were selected to represent five geographical areas covering New Zealand and five categories of predominant environmental impact: birds, dairy farming, forestry/undeveloped, municipal, and sheep/pastoral farming. Six of the sites were also source waters for treated drinking-water supplies. Of the indicators, E. coli was detected in 99 % of all samples, with somatic coliphage being detected most of the time (89 %). Of the pathogens tested, Campylobacter and human adenoviruses were inferred to be the most likely to cause human waterborne illness to recreational freshwater users. Using data from all sites, an estimated 5 % of notified campylobacteriosis cases in New Zealand could be attributable to water contact recreation. The critical value for E. coli as an indicator of increased Campylobacter infection is in the range of 200-500 E. coli per 100 ml. This result has been used to derive new national water quality guidelines for recreational fresh water in New Zealand.
TI  - Chromosomal engineering of Clostridium perfringens using group II introns.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a major natural pathogen of human and domestic animals owing to the production of multiple toxins. Defined clostridial mutants are essential for studying the role of toxins in disease pathogenesis. However, it has been very difficult to introduce mutations into C. perfringens. We recently developed a clostridia-modified targetron that can specifically and efficiently inactivate C. perfringens genes. The usefulness of this system has now been demonstrated by specifically inactivating four different C. perfringens toxin genes.
TI  - Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for Qnr-like PRPs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis in Escherichia coli DH10B. MIC values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and E. coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for PRPs. RESULTS: Amino acid identity of Qnr-like PRPs in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA1, QnrB1 and QnrS1 was in the range of 16% to 22%. Recombinant plasmids coding for Qnr-like PRPs conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/L), depending on the antimicrobial agent and PRP. The PRP from B. subtilis showed no protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: The PRPs analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in E. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in quinolone resistance of PRPs from different gram-positive species. These gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbial quality of Tajik sambusa and control of Clostridium perfringens germination and outgrowth by buffered sodium citrate and potassium lactate.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens spore destruction, aerobic plate counts (APCs), and counts of Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and Escherichia coli during baking of sambusa (a traditional Tajik food) were evaluated. Control of germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores in sambusa during cooling at room or refrigerated temperatures was evaluated using organic acid salts (buffered sodium citrate [Ional] and 1 and 2% potassium lactate, wt/wt). Sambusa were prepared with 40 g of either inoculated or noninoculated meat and baked for 45 min at 180 degrees C. For evaluation of destruction of C. perfringens spores during heating and germination and outgrowth of spores during cooling, ground beef was inoculated and mixed with a three-strain cocktail of C. perfringens spores. Aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and E. coli were enumerated in noninoculated sambusa before and after baking and after cooling at room or refrigeration temperatures. After baking, APCs and Enterobacteriaceae and coliform counts were reduced by 4.32, 2.55, and 1.96 log CFU/g, respectively. E. coli counts were below detectable levels in ground beef and sambusa samples. Enterobacteriaceae, coliform, and E. coli counts were below detectable levels (< 0.04 log CFU/g) in sambusa after cooling by both methods. Total C. perfringens populations increased (4.67 log CFU/g) during cooling at room temperature, but minimal increases (0.31 log CFU/g) were observed during cooling under refrigeration. Incorporation of 2% (wt/wt) buffered sodium citrate controlled C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth (0.25 log CFU/g), whereas incorporation of up to 2% (wt/wt) potassium lactate did not prevent C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth. Incorporation of organic acid salts at appropriate concentrations can prevent germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens in improperly cooled sambusa.
TI  - In vitro activity of potential probiotic Lactobacillus murinus isolated from the  dog.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to isolate and identify Lactobacillus spp. isolates from faeces of a healthy dog, and to characterize their potential as probiotics in order to evaluate their possible use as probiotics for dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS: An in vitro approach was used to characterize the isolates as potential probiotics including the evaluation of pH and bile salts tolerance, production of antimicrobial substances, biofilm formation on glass and polystyrene surfaces, aggregation ability and adhesion to canine intestinal mucus. The isolates survived to different pH and bile salts conditions, inhibited the in vitro growth of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, and adhered to glass and intestinal mucus. CONCLUSIONS: The properties shown by these isolates may indicate that they could colonize and persist in the gastrointestinal tract and induce beneficial effects to the host. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The evaluation of native canine isolates and future experimental feeding assays may be useful tools to develop probiotics to improve animal health and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  - Twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, C. perfringens). Two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. Isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as L. crispatus or L. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of S. aureus, B. cereus and E. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. Diarrhea-causing E. coli O8K88H9 Ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of L. reuteri 12/26. Mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.
TI  - [Cloning of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin gene and extracellular expression in Escherichia coli].
AB  - Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that widely propagets in the soil and the gastrointestinal tract of human and animals. This bacteria causes food poisoning, gas gangrene and other various range of infectious diseases. But there is no standard diagnosis method of C. perfringens. In order to develop a new type of immunoassay for clinical purpose, we studied expression and extracellular secretion of recombinant alpha-toxin having enzyme activity in E. coli expression system. Cloning was carried out after PCR amplification from C. perfringens GAI 94074 which was clinical isolate. Three kinds of fragment were cloned using pET100/D-TOPO vector. These fragments coded for ribosome binding site, signal peptide, and alpha-toxin gene respectively. Recombinant pET100 plasmid transformed into TOP 10 cells and the obtained plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. Then, the transformants were induced expression with IPTG. In conclusion, we successfully cloned, expressed and exteracellular secreted C. perfringens alpha-toxin containing signal peptide. Biologically, the obtained recombinant protein was positive for phospholipase C activity.
TI  - Faecal-indicator bacteria and sedimentary processes in estuarine mudflats (Seine, France).
AB  - Over a three-year period, quantification of faecal indicators and the molecular detection of Escherichia coli and Salmonella were monitored in sediments from three contrasting mudflats of the Seine estuary (France). The elevation of the mudflat surface was monitored concurrently using a high-resolution altimeter. During the period of the study, estuarine mudflats were areas of deposition for faecal-indicator bacteria and were mainly controlled by sedimentary processes. In the intertidal freshwater and subtidal mudflats, the highest abundances of faecal-indicator bacteria were counted during a depositional period. Maximum levels were observed in the freshwater mudflats during periods of high flow: thermotolerant coliforms: 3.9 x 10(4) cfu cm(-2), enterococci: 1.2 x 10(4) cfu cm(-2), Clostridium perfringens spores: 9.8 x 10(5) spores cm(-2). Loss of culturability of enteric bacteria in sediment microcosms demonstrated the remediatory capacity of the mudflats, even if they might be a secondary source of bacteria-forming spores to the water column through erosion and resuspension events.
TI  - [Investigation of a foodborne intoxication in a high-density penitentiary center].
AB  - BACKGROUND: On September 25 2005, more than 100 inmates (almost 5% of the 1,800 prison population) experienced sudden onset gastroenteritis. This outbreak was the largest foodborne outbreak described in a prison population in Spain. Our objective was to confirm the outbreak, identify risk factors, implement control measures, and provide recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a cohort analysis of a stratified random sample of all the inmates, a cohort analysis of the one of the prison blocks, and an environmental investigation. RESULTS: A total of 221 inmates were selected, of which 196 were interviewed. Twenty-eight percent had gastroenteritis and the main symptoms were abdominal pain (85%) and diarrhea (71%). All foods consumed caused similar attack rates. Factors associated with the risk of illness were eating the entire portion of seafood cocktail at lunch or all of the fried shrimp at dinner on September 24 (RR = 2; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8, and RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1). Analysis of one of the prison blocks yielded results similar to those of the random sample. Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli were isolated from a sample of the seafood cocktail. CONCLUSION: A gastroenteritis outbreak caused by several pa-thogens was confirmed. Both the reported symptoms and the calculated incubation periods corresponded to the pathogens isolated. Preparation of food in prison facilities should meet minimum safety standards, including refrigeration and training of food handlers.
TI  - The effects of several oligosaccharides on growth performance, nutrient digestibilities, and cecal microbial populations in young chicks.
AB  - Two experiments were conducted with New Hampshire x Columbian chicks fed a corn-soybean meal diet and 1 experiment was conducted with chicks fed a dextrose-isolated soy protein diet to examine the effects of inulin, oligofructose, mannanoligosaccharide (MOS), short-chain fructooligosaccharide (SCFOS), and transgalactooligosaccharide on growth performance, ME(n), digestibility of amino acids (AA), and cecal microbial populations. Each diet was fed to chicks from 0 to 21 d of age, and excreta were collected at 3-4, 7, 14, and 21 d of age in both experiments. Neither 4 nor 8 g of oligosaccharides/kg had a significant effect on growth performance. The ME(n) and AA digestibility values increased with increasing age. Feeding 8 g/kg of inulin and SCFOS had a negative effect (P <0.05) on ME(n) at most ages, and 8 g/kg of most of the oligosaccharides reduced (P <0.05) digestibility of AA at various ages. In experiment 2, 4 g/kg of SCFOS, MOS, and transgalactooligosaccharide significantly reduced ME(n) at 3 to 4 d, but most oligosaccharides increased (P <0.05) ME(n) values at 7, 14, and 21 d. The effects of oligosaccharides (4 g/kg) on AA digestibility were generally small and inconsistent. Feeding corn-soybean meal diets containing 4 g/kg of oligosaccharides had no significant effect on cecal Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillius, Clostridium perfringens, or Escherichia coli populations in 21-d-old chicks. In a third experiment, cecal populations of C. perfringens were reduced when SCFOS and MOS were supplemented at 4 g/kg into a dextrose-isolated soy protein diet. These results indicate that a low concentration (4 g/kg) of an indigestible, prebiotic oligosaccharide can be fed with no deleterious effects on ME(n) and AA digestibility. Feeding a higher level of an oligosaccharide (8 g/kg), however, may depress ME(n) and AA digestibility.
TI  - Preliminary study on the efficacy and safety of eight individual and blended disinfectants against poultry and dairy indicator organisms.
AB  - Eight individual and blended chemical disinfectants were screened for preliminary evaluation of safety, bactericidal and virucidal effectiveness against poultry and dairy organisms. The test organisms were Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens, in addition to avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Viable counts of surviving bacteria were determined after 30 min contact with each disinfectant and in the presence or absence of skimmed milk, to simulate the interference of organic matter. The haemagglutination test was used to assess the survival of the test viruses in the presence of the different disinfectants after propagation in 10-day-old chick embryos. In the presence of skimmed milk, a higher concentration of most of the disinfectants examined was required to exert antimicrobial effectiveness. When used individually, quaternary ammonium showed no virucidal activity against NDV and AIV; peracetic acid was not effective against Streptococcus spp., S. Enteritidis and NDV, while iodophors showed low bactericidal and inconsistent virucidal activity. The single and blended disinfectants with high microbicidal activities included phenols (high bactericidal and virucidal activity), blends of quaternary ammonium compounds (high bactericidal activity) and blends of cresols and organic acids (high virucidal activity). This suggests the use of blends of compatible compounds for disinfection operations in poultry and dairy industries since they will target a wider range of micro-organisms. None of the disinfectants had a negative effect on the development of the different organs of chicken embryos and the iodine-based disinfectant, developed for dairy-teat dipping, also showed no adverse reactions in experimental cows.
TI  - Clinical mastitis in ewes; bacteriology, epidemiology and clinical features.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical mastitis is an important disease in sheep. The objective of  this work was to identify causal bacteria and study certain epidemiological and clinical features of clinical mastitis in ewes kept for meat and wool production. METHODS: The study included 509 ewes with clinical mastitis from 353 flocks located in 14 of the 19 counties in Norway. Clinical examination and collection of udder secretions were carried out by veterinarians. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on 92 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from 64 ewes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: S. aureus was recovered from 65.3% of 547 clinically affected mammary glands, coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2.9%, enterobacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, from 7.3%, Streptococcus spp. from 4.6%, Mannheimia haemolytica from 1.8% and various other bacteria from 4.9%, while no bacteria were cultured from 13.2% of the samples. Forty percent of the ewes with unilateral clinical S. aureus mastitis also had a subclinical S. aureus infection in the other mammary gland. Twenty-four of 28 (86%) pairs of S. aureus isolates obtained from clinically and subclinically affected mammary glands of the same ewe were indistinguishable by PFGE. The number of identical pairs was significantly greater than expected, based on the distribution of different S. aureus types within the flocks. One-third of the cases occurred during the first week after lambing, while a second peak was observed in the third week of lactation. Gangrene was present in 8.8% of the clinically affected glands; S. aureus was recovered from 72.9%, Clostridium perfringens from 6.3% and E. coli from 6.3% of the secretions from such glands. This study shows that S. aureus predominates as a cause of clinical ovine mastitis in Norway, also in very severe cases. Results also indicate that S. aureus is frequently spread between udder halves of infected ewes.
TI  - [Clostridium spp. isolated from surgical specimens].
AB  - In the present study, the isolation rate of Clostridium spp. from surgical specimens and its antimicrobial susceptibilities were examined. Last 24 years, Clostridium spp. was isolated from 65 (1.8%) out of 3,644 specimens from the surgical abdominal infections. Clostridium spp. was most frequently isolated from secondary peritonitis such as perforated peritonitis, followed by hepato-biliary tract infection. There were 59 cases (90.8%) of mixed infection with Clostridium spp. and other bacteria. The rate of mixed infection with Bacteroides spp. (23.6%) was highest, followed by Escherichia coli (19.7%), other aerobic Gram-negative rods and Enterococcus spp. Although Clostridium perfringens was highly sensitive to penicillins, cephems and carbapenems, a small number of Clostridium spp. other than Clostridium perfringens were resistant to cephems, erythromycin clindamycin and fosfomycin, respectively.
TI  - Impact of feed supplementation with antimicrobial agents on growth performance of broiler chickens, Clostridium perfringens and enterococcus counts, and antibiotic resistance phenotypes and distribution of antimicrobial resistance determinants in Escherichia coli isolates.
AB  - The effects of feed supplementation with the approved antimicrobial agents bambermycin, penicillin, salinomycin, and bacitracin or a combination of salinomycin plus bacitracin were evaluated for the incidence and distribution of antibiotic resistance in 197 commensal Escherichia coli isolates from broiler chickens over 35 days. All isolates showed some degree of multiple antibiotic resistance. Resistance to tetracycline (68.5%), amoxicillin (61.4%), ceftiofur (51.3%), spectinomycin (47.2%), and sulfonamides (42%) was most frequent. The levels of resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin were 33.5, 35.5, and 25.3%, respectively. The overall resistance levels decreased from day 7 to day 35 (P < 0.001). Comparing treatments, the levels of resistance to ceftiofur, spectinomycin, and gentamicin (except for resistance to bacitracin treatment) were significantly higher in isolates from chickens receiving feed supplemented with salinomycin than from the other feeds (P < 0.001). Using a DNA microarray analysis capable of detecting commonly found antimicrobial resistance genes, we characterized 104 tetracycline-resistant E. coli isolates from 7- to 28-day-old chickens fed different growth promoters. Results showed a decrease in the incidence of isolates harboring tet(B), bla(TEM), sulI, and aadA and class 1 integron from days 7 to 35 (P < 0.01). Of the 84 tetracycline-ceftiofur-resistant E. coli isolates, 76 (90.5%) were positive for bla(CMY-2). The proportions of isolates positive for sulI, aadA, and integron class 1 were significantly higher in salinomycin-treated chickens than in the control or other treatment groups (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that multiantibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates can be found in broiler chickens regardless of the antimicrobial growth promoters used. However, the phenotype and the distribution of resistance determinants in E. coli can be modulated by feed supplementation with some of the antimicrobial agents used in broiler chicken production.
TI  - A systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. DATA SOURCES: Studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. Hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. Specific organisms under review were Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus. Data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. Where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. A decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical UK population. Finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of GPs, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. RESULTS: Good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. Indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. The significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. Economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that PCR for Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli O157 is potentially very successful in identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. Less is known about the benefits of testing for B. cereus, C. perfringens and S. aureus. Further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.
TI  - The effect of probiotic fermented milk and inulin on the functions and microecology of the intestine.
AB  - We investigated the effects of a probiotic fermented milk and inulin on gastrointestinal function and microecology. The study was double-blinded and comprised 66 healthy adults (22 male, 44 female), mean age 40 years (range, 22-60 years). After a 12-d baseline period the subjects were randomized to consume, for 3 weeks, 3x200 ml daily of either (1) a fermented milk with probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum BB536, Bifidobacterium spp. 420 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 145), (2) a fermented milk with the same probiotics plus 4 g inulin, or (3) a control fermented milk. During the last 7 d of the baseline and the intervention periods, the subjects kept a record of their defaecation frequency and gastrointestinal symptoms, and collected all their faeces. Intestinal transit time, stool weight and faecal enzyme activities were measured. Thirty-nine subjects were randomized to give faecal samples for analysis of pH and microbes, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides and Clostridium perfringens. Consumption of fermented milk with probiotics or with probiotics and inulin increased the faecal number of lactobacilli (P=0.009, P=0.003) and bifidobacteria (P=0.046, P=0.038) compared with the baseline. Compared with the control fermented milk, both active products increased lactobacilli (P=0.005, ANCOVA). Subjects consuming fermented milk with probiotics and inulin suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, especially flatulence, more than the others (P<0.001). In conclusion, the probiotic fermented milk product had a positive effect by increasing the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon. Inulin did not alter this effect but it increased gastrointestinal symptoms.
TI  - Pathogen and indicator variability in a heavily impacted watershed.
AB  - Water samples were collected from 36 locations within the Grand River Watershed,  in Southwestern Ontario, Canada from July 2002 to December 2003 and were analyzed for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and thermophilic Campylobacter spp. A subset of samples was also analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., culturable human enteric viruses, and Clostridium perfringens. Storm and snowmelt events were sampled at two locations including a drinking water intake. For the majority of the events, the Spearman rank correlation test showed a positive correlation between E. coli levels and turbidity. Peaks in pathogen numbers frequently preceded the peaks in numbers of indicator organisms and turbidity. Pathogen levels sometimes decreased to undetectable levels during an event. As pathogen peaks did not correspond to turbidity and indicator peaks, the correlations were weak. Weak correlations may be the result of differences in the sources of the pathogens, rather than differences in pathogen movement through the environment. Results from this investigation have implications for planning monitoring programs for water quality and for the development of pathogen fate and transport models to be used for source water risk assessment.
TI  - Behaviour of pathogenic and indicator bacteria during urban wastewater treatment  and sludge composting, as revealed by quantitative PCR.
AB  - Two enteric pathogens, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni, and two bacteria commonly used as indicators, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, were monitored using quantitative real-time PCR during municipal wastewater treatment and sludge composting. The results were compared with those obtained using standard culture methods. A reduction of all bacteria was observed during wastewater treatment and during the thermophilic phase of composting. However, the bacterial groups studied behaved differently during the process, and the main differences were observed during biological treatment in activated sludge basins. In particular, Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni survived better during activated sludge treatment than E. coli. C. jejuni was the most resistant to wastewater treatment among the four bacterial groups. Overall, differences in survival were observed for all bacteria studied, when submitted to the same environmental pressure. This holds both for differences between indicators and pathogenic bacteria and between pathogenic bacteria. These results show the difficulty in defining reliable indicators.
TI  - A dose-response evaluation of spray-dried yeast cell wall supplementation of diets fed to adult dogs: effects on nutrient digestibility, immune indices, and fecal microbial populations.
AB  - The yeast cell wall (YCW) preparation, Safmannan, was evaluated as a dietary supplement for adult dogs. Using a 5 x 5 Latin square design with 14-d periods, adult dogs cannulated in the terminal ileum were supplemented with 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.45, or 0.65% YCW based on daily food allowance. Apparent ileal nutrient digestibility responded cubically (P = 0.07 to 0.10) to YCW supplementation. Ileal nutrient digestibility tended (P = 0.09) to be greater with YCW supplementation compared with control. Apparent total tract digestibility responded cubically (P < 0.05) to YCW supplementation. Total white blood cell and eosinophil counts tended (P < 0.09) to decrease quadratically with YCW supplementation, with the lowest counts at the 0.25% supplementation level, whereas monocyte counts decreased (P < 0.05) linearly with YCW supplementation. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentrations tended (P = 0.09) to respond cubically to YCW, with the lowest value at the 0.25% supplementation level. Ileal IgA tended (P < 0.09) to respond quadratically, with the greatest ileal IgA concentration at 0.25% YCW. Using serial dilution and plating enumeration techniques, fecal Escherichia coli concentrations decreased linearly (P = 0.01) with YCW supplementation, whereas Clostridium perfringens responded cubically (P = 0.09). Cubic trends were noted for E. coli (P = 0.10) and lactobacilli (P = 0.08) concentrations, as evaluated by quantitative PCR analysis. Total fecal DNA was most similar to the control treatment at 0.25% YCW. Although the effects on immunological indices appear limited, our results suggest that YCW supplementation in dogs at less than 1% may affect ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility, and the colonization of the gut by E. coli may be decreased.
TI  - Immunization of broiler chickens against Clostridium perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis.
AB  - Necrotic enteritis (NE) in broiler chickens is caused by Clostridium perfringens. Currently, no vaccine against NE is available and immunity to NE is not well characterized. Our previous studies showed that immunity to NE followed oral infection by virulent rather than avirulent C. perfringens strains and identified immunogenic secreted proteins apparently uniquely produced by virulent C. perfringens isolates. These proteins were alpha-toxin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase, and a hypothetical protein (HP). The current study investigated the role of each of these proteins in conferring protection to broiler chickens against oral infection challenges of different severities with virulent C. perfringens. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and purified as histidine-tagged recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli and were used to immunize broiler chickens intramuscularly. Serum and intestinal antibody responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All proteins significantly protected broiler chickens against a relatively mild challenge. In addition, immunization with alpha-toxin, HP, and PFOR also offered significant protection against a more severe challenge. When the birds were primed with alpha-toxoid and boosted with active toxin, birds immunized with alpha-toxin were provided with the greatest protection against a severe challenge. The serum and intestinal washings from protected birds had high antigen-specific antibody titers. Thus, we conclude that there are certain secreted proteins, in addition to alpha-toxin, that are involved in immunity to NE in broiler chickens.
TI  - Assessment of faecal contamination and the relationship between pathogens and faecal bacterial indicators in an estuarine environment (Seine, France).
AB  - The Seine estuary, one of the largest estuaries of the European northwest continental shelf, is subjected to numerous anthropogenic influences. Here we present an assessment of the microbial faecal contamination of the estuary water. The most vulnerable areas were defined on the basis of the fluxes of indicator organisms and the occurrence of Salmonella and Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. (oo)cysts. The microbial quality of the water changes from upstream to downstream: in the upstream area, contamination by faecal-indicator bacteria and Salmonella occurs during periods of high flow; in the urbanized area, mid-way between the uppermost areas of the estuary and its mouth, discharge from a wastewater treatment plant and a tributary degrade water quality; at the estuary mouth, the accumulation of microorganisms attached to particles in the maximum turbidity zone, particularly Clostridium perfringens spores and oocysts of Cryptosporidium, is accompanied by inputs of ThC and Escherichia coli from tributaries. In some areas, significant strong relations are observed between Salmonella, (oo)cysts of protozoan, and levels of faecal indicators.
TI  - Pathological findings in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina): 1996-2005.
AB  - Between 1996 and 2005 the carcasses of 355 harbour seals originating from the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, were investigated for pathological changes. The animals were collected before (n=280) and after (n=75) the second phocine distemper virus (PDV) epizootic in 2002. The seals were either found dead or were killed due to severe illness. Necropsy was performed in each case, in addition to histopathological, immunohistochemical, microbiological and parasitological examinations. Throughout the period of study, the respiratory and alimentary tracts were the organ systems most consistently affected by pathological change. The most common cause of death was bronchopneumonia caused by parasitic and/or bacterial infection of the lung. Less frequently identified changes included: trauma, gastroenteritis, uterine torsion or dystocia, polyarthritis/polymyositis, intestinal torsion, septicaemia, dermatitis, and keratitis. The most frequent causes of bronchopneumonia, gastroenteritis, polyarthritis, dermatitis and septicaemia were infections with alpha/beta-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. A number of changes were more frequently identified after 2002. These included the presence of parasites in the lung, stomach and intestine; bronchopneumonia, gastritis, enteritis, septicaemia and perinatal death. The increased prevalence of these changes may have been related to the preceding PDV epidemic.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Purification of the recombinant beta2 toxin (CPB2) from an enterotoxaemic bovine  Clostridium perfringens strain and production of a specific immune serum.
AB  - Overgrowth of Clostridium perfringens clones with production of one or more of its toxin(s) results in diverse digestive and systemic pathologies in human and animals, such as cattle enterotoxaemia. The so-called beta2 toxin (CPB2) is the most recently described major toxin produced by C. perfringens. In this study, the cpb2 ORF (cpb2FM) from a cattle C. perfringens-associated enterotoxaemia was cloned and sequenced. The cpb2FM and its deduced nucleotide sequence clearly corresponded to the cpb2 allele considered as "consensus" and not to "atypical" allele, despite its "non-porcine" origin. Expression assays of the recombinant toxin CPB2FM were performed in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis with the expression vector pBLTS72, and by genomic integration by double recombination in B. subtilis. Highest level of production was obtained with the expression vector in B. subtilis 168 strain. The recombinant CPB2FM protein was purified and a specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum was produced. Polyclonal antibodies could detect CPB2 production in supernatants of C. perfringens from enterotoxaemic cattle.
TI  - Soluble CD14 and CD83 from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells are inducible  by commensal bacteria and suppress allergen-induced human neonatal Th2 differentiation.
AB  - CD14 is expressed on the cell surface of various antigen-presenting cells, and CD83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells (DC). CD14 and CD83 are also present as soluble proteins, and both have immunoregulatory functions. We examined whether neonatal cord blood monocytes or DC released soluble CD14 (sCD14) or sCD83 when exposed to the commensal intestinal bacteria Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis. We found that the gram-positive bacteria C. perfringens and S. aureus, but not gram-negative bacteria, induced the release of sCD14 from monocytes. DC, on the other hand, released sCD14 in response to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, the expression of the virulence factor staphylococcal protein A seemed to be important for S. aureus-induced sCD14 production from both monocytes and DC. Soluble CD83 was released from DC, but not from monocytes, when exposed to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Finally, to investigate whether sCD14 or sCD83 could modulate neonatal allergen-induced T-cell differentiation, DC were exposed to birch allergen alone or in the presence of sCD14 or sCD83 and then cocultured with autologous T cells. We demonstrate that sCD14 and sCD83 inhibited the birch allergen-induced Th2 differentiation by suppressing interleukin 13 production. Together, these results suggest that the commensal intestinal flora may be an important stimulus for the developing immune system by inducing the immunoregulatory proteins sCD14 and sCD83, which may be involved in preventing T-cell sensitization to allergens in infants.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  - The development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. The important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. Systematic monitoring of fecal bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. Clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. The temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees C, compared with the 4 degrees C location, where these species were found in lower numbers. Moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas was found only at this last location. The temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of Campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a pH close to 6. Spore forms of C. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.
TI  - Microbiological safety of retail vacuum-packed and modified-atmosphere-packed cooked meats at end of shelf life.
AB  - A study of retail modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed cooked ready-to-eat meats was undertaken from September through mid-November 2003 to determine the microbiological quality at the end of shelf life and to establish any risk factors in the production, storage, and display of this product. Examination of 2,981 samples using Microbiological Guidelines criteria revealed that 66% were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiology quality, 33% were of unsatisfactory quality mainly due to high aerobic colony counts and Enterobacteriaceae concentrations, and 1% were of unacceptable quality due to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes at 100 CFU/g or higher (27 samples; range of 10(2) to 106 CFU/g) and Campylobacter jejuni (1 sample), indicating a risk to health. All samples at the end of the shelf life had satisfactory (<20 CFU/g) and/or acceptable (<102 CFU/g) levels of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens, four samples (<1%) had unsatisfactory levels of Escherichia coli (range of 102 to 106 CFU/g) and 5.5% of the samples contained L. monocytogenes at <20 CFU/g (4.8%) or between 20 and 100 CFU/g (0.7%). More samples of chicken (45%; 224 of 495 samples), beef (43%; 160 of 371 samples), and turkey (41%; 219 of 523 samples) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable quality compared with ham (23%; 317 of 1,351 samples) or pork (32%; 67 of 206 samples). Twelve different L. monocytogenes typing characters (serotype-amplified fragment length polymorphism type-phage type) were evaluated for isolates recovered from samples of unacceptable quality, and the 1/2-IX-NT type was recovered from almost half (48%) of these samples. Salmonella was not detected in any samples examined. Risk factors identified for cooked meats that were microbiologically contaminated more frequently included vacuum packaging, packaging on retail premises, slicing, temperature not monitored in display units, and no hazard analysis system in place. Results from this study also suggest that the shelf life assigned to some modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed meats may not be appropriate.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Mortality in Pennsylvania captive elk (Cervus elaphus): 1998-2006.
AB  - The necropsy records of 65 elk ranging from 1 day to 13(1/2) years of age were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. The animal carcasses were submitted from 22 separate Pennsylvania elk farms over an approximately 8-year period. The most common causes of mortality in animals in which the cause of death was determined were gastrointestinal parasitism (21 cases), pneumonia (7 cases), enterocolitis (5 cases), malnutrition (5 cases), and rumenitis/acidosis (5 cases). The cause of death was undetermined in 4 of the 65 elk. Nematode organisms (20 cases) were the primary parasites identified in cases of mortality owing to gastrointestinal parasitism. Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3 cases), Escherichia coli (3 cases), and Streptococcus sp. (2 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lung in the cases of pneumonia. Fungal organisms, consistent with Aspergillus sp. were present histologically within the pulmonary lesions in 5 cases. Bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included Clostridium perfringens (2 cases), E. coli (1 case), Salmonella Newport (1 case) and Salmonella Thompson (1 case). The majority (56.3%) of the death loss in elk of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 71.4% of the gastrointestinal parasitism, 60.0% of the malnutrition, 60.0% of the enterocolitis, and 57.1% of the pneumonia cases occurring in animals within this age range. In conclusion, gastrointestinal parasitism, pneumonia, malnutrition, enterocolitis and rumenitis/acidosis were considered the most common causes of death in captive elk in this study.
TI  - Evaluation of hot-water and sanitizer dip treatments of knives contaminated with  bacteria and meat residue.
AB  - Hot water (HW; 82.2 degrees C, 180 degreesF) is used for sanitation of meat cutting implements in most slaughter facilities, but validation of actual practices against meat-borne bacterial pathogens and spoilage flora is lacking. Observed implement immersions in HW in two large pork processing plants were found to typically be < or = 1 s. Impact of these practices on bacteria on metal surfaces was assessed in the laboratory, and alternative treatments were investigated. Knives were inoculated with raw pork residues and Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium DT104, Clostridium perfringens, and Lactobacillus spp. and were sampled before and after 1- or 15-s dips of blades in HW, warm water (48.9 degrees C), or warm sanitizers (neutral or acid quaternary ammonium compounds [QAC] at 400 ppm, or peroxyacetic acid at 700 ppm H2O2 and 165 ppm peroxyacetic acid). Simultaneous scrubbing and 15-s dipping in HW or acid QAC was also evaluated. Reductions on knives dipped for 1 s were usually < 1 log and were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between treatments. Reductions of E. coli O157:H7 after 15 s in HW, neutral QAC, acid QAC, or peroxyacetic acid were 3.02, 2.38, 3.04, and 1.52 log, respectively. Reductions of other bacteria due to HW were not significantly different from sanitizers and were significantly greater than warm water for all bacteria except C. perfringens. Combined scrubbing and 15-s dipping in HW resulted in a 2.91- and 2.25-log reduction of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium DT104, respectively, whereas reduction caused by acid QAC was significantly less at about 1.7 log each. Brief dip treatments of contaminated knives have limited efficacy, but longer immersions cause greater reductions that were not enhanced by scrubbing. QAC is a suitable alternative to HW in this application.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of some heat treated turkey products at different processing stages.
AB  - Random samples at the three processing stages of turkey keshta, turkey rosto, turkey luncheon and turkey frankfurter (20 samples for each stage were collected). For luncheon and frankfurter, 20 samples of each of thighs and breast represents the 1 st stage of processing were also taken. These samples were obtained from some meat processing plants at Alexandria province to make a total of 280 samples. The samples were examined microbiologically and the results revealed that, the total aerobic bacterial count in the examined Keshta and rosto shows their highest count in the 1st stage and gradually decreased in the 2nd and 3rd stages. On the other hand, the total aerobic bacterial count in luncheon and frankfurter samples slightly increased in the 2nd stage and then decreased in the 3rd stage. The Coliform count also shows its highest count in the 1st stage and decreased in the 2nd stage and could not be detected from the 3rd stage of keshta and rosto samples, while it increased slightly in 2nd stage and could not be detected in the 3rd stage for luncheon and frankfurter samples. E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus were higher in the 1st stage than in the 2nd stage of processing of the examined keshta and rosto samples while they were higher in the 2nd stage than in the 1st one in luncheon and frankfurter samples but could not be detected from the 3rd stage in all products. Both Clostridium perfningens and Salmonella could not be detected in the examined turkey products at the different processing stages. The total mould and yeast counts in the examined products showed highest count in the 1st stage and decreased in the 2nd stage and could not be detected in keshta and rosto in 3rd stage while in frankfurter samples the counts in the 1st and 2nd stages were nearly the same and decreased in the 3rd stage but in luncheon samples the count was slightly increased in the 2nd stage and not detected in the 3rd stage. The public health significance of microorganisms as well as the suggested hygienic measures in order to improve the quality of the examined turkey products were discussed.
TI  - The beta-defensin gallinacin-6 is expressed in the chicken digestive tract and has antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Food-borne pathogens are responsible for most cases of food poisoning in developed countries and are often associated with poultry products, including chicken. Little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken digestive tract and their efficacy. In this study, the expression of chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (Gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens were investigated. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed high expression of Gal-6 mRNA in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract. Putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the Gal-6 gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the Gal-6 gene. In colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli. Treatment with 16 mug/ml synthetic Gal-6 resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in Clostridium perfringens survival within 60 min, indicating fast killing kinetics. Transmission electron microscopy examination of synthetic-Gal-6-treated Clostridium perfringens cells showed dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells, and cell lysis. The high expression in the proximal digestive tract and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 plays an important role in chicken innate host defense.
TI  - Microbiological baseline study of broiler chickens at Swedish slaughterhouses.
AB  - This 1-year study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and concentrations of  pathogenic and indicator bacteria on Swedish broiler chickens. A total of 636 chilled carcasses were collected from 10 slaughterhouses and sent to the National Food Administration for analyses of carcass rinses. No carcasses were positive for Salmonella. Campylobacter, predominantly Campylobacter jejuni, were detected on 15% (by enrichment) or 14% (by direct plating) of the carcasses. With one exception, all samples from late December through April were Campylobacter negative. The 10th and 90th percentiles of Campylobacter numbers per carcasses were 3.0 and 5.0 log CFU, respectively, and the maximum was 7.1 log CFU. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected on 68% of the carcasses, with a maximum of 3.5 log CFU/cm2. The 10th and 90th percentiles were 3.4 and 4.4 log CFU/cm2 for total aerobic microorganisms, 1.8 and 3.3 log CFU/cm2 for Enterobacteriaceae, and 2.0 and 3.6 log CFU/cm2 for Escherichia coli. No correlation was found between numbers of any indicator bacteria and numbers of pathogenic bacteria. Subsets of the samples were analyzed for Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica, and Enterococcus, resulting in prevalence estimates of 29, 18, 9 (as determined by a PCR assay), and 97%, respectively. L. monocytogenes was most common at slaughterhouses with a low prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, and vice versa. These results will improve the ability of researchers to assess the importance of chicken as a source of foodborne pathogens and can serve as a basis for risk management actions.
TI  - Antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide inhibits the pyruvate oxidoreductases of Helicobacter pylori, selected anaerobic bacteria and parasites, and Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Nitazoxanide (NTZ) exhibits broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic bacteria and parasites and the ulcer-causing pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Here we show that NTZ is a noncompetitive inhibitor (K(i), 2 to 10 microM) of the pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductases (PFORs) of Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, H. pylori, and Campylobacter jejuni and is weakly active against the pyruvate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli. To further mechanistic studies, the PFOR operon of H. pylori was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli, and the multisubunit complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Pyruvate-dependent PFOR activity with NTZ, as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 418 nm (spectral shift from 418 to 351 nm), unlike the reduction of viologen dyes, did not result in the accumulation of products (acetyl coenzyme A and CO(2)) and pyruvate was not consumed in the reaction. NTZ did not displace the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) cofactor of PFOR, and the 351-nm absorbing form of NTZ was inactive. Optical scans and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses determined that the spectral shift (A(418) to A(351)) of NTZ was due to protonation of the anion (NTZ(-)) of the 2-amino group of the thiazole ring which could be generated with the pure compound under acidic solutions (pK(a) = 6.18). We propose that NTZ(-) intercepts PFOR at an early step in the formation of the lactyl-TPP transition intermediate, resulting in the reversal of pyruvate binding prior to decarboxylation and in coordination with proton transfer to NTZ. Thus, NTZ might be the first example of an antimicrobial that targets the "activated cofactor" of an enzymatic reaction rather than its substrate or catalytic sites, a novel mechanism that may escape mutation-based drug resistance.
TI  - Detection of a group II intron without an open reading frame in the alpha-toxin gene of Clostridium perfringens isolated from a broiler chicken.
AB  - A DNA insertion of 834 bp, designated CPF-G2Im, was identified within the alpha toxin gene (cpa) of Clostridium perfringens strain CPBC16ML, isolated from a broiler chicken. Sequence analysis of CPF-G2Im indicated that it was integrated 340 nucleotides downstream of the start codon of cpa. However, the insertion did not abolish the phospholipase C and hemolytic activities of CPBC16ML. To investigate the expression of its alpha toxin, the intact copy of cpa was cloned into an expression vector and transformed into Escherichia coli M15 cells. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the protein expressed from the transformant as well as in the culture supernatant of C. perfringens strain CPBC16ML had the expected molecular weight detected in reference strains of C. perfringens. Northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the entire CPF-G2Im insertion was completely spliced from the cpa precursor mRNA transcripts. The sequence of the insertion fragment has 95% and 97% identity to two noncoding regions corresponding to sequences that flank a predicted group II RT gene present in the pCPF4969 plasmid of C. perfringens. However, an RT was not encoded by the CPF-G2Im fragment. Based on the secondary structure prediction analysis, CPF-G2Im revealed typical features of group II introns. The present study shows that CPF-G2Im is capable of splicing in both C. perfringens and E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a group II intron without an open reading frame (ORF) is located in the cpa ORF of C. perfringens.
TI  - Prevalence of some bacteria yeasts and molds in meat foods in San Luis, Argentina.
AB  - In this work we evaluate the microbiological quality and the hygiene degree of meat foods consumed in the city of San Luis. A total of 515 meat food samples (315 from fresh sausages, 100 from hamburgers and 100 from ground beef) were processed, being the most of them non-industrial products. The microbiological quality was determined by counts of total mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, molds and yeasts, and Clostridium perfringens. The number of total mesophilic aerobes was within the 10(6) cfu/g limit set by the Argentinaan Alimentary Code (AAC). Two hundred seventy six samples exhibited E. coli levels between 10(1) and 10(3) cfu/g. The 58.26% of the samples with E. coli counts above > 10(1) cfu/g came from hamburgers and fresh sausages exceeding the AAC limits. Counts of molds and yeasts ranged between 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/g. From a total of 515 samples, 126 exhibited C. perfringens, out of which 80 (64.08%) gave counts > 10(2)/g, exceeding the limits set by the AAC. Out of these 80 samples, C. perfringens counts were above 10(5) cfu/g in 12 of them, and E. coli was also detected in 48 samples (38.10%). The samples with counts > 10(5) C. perfringens/g are potentially responsible for alimentary intoxication. The results obtained indicate the need to improve the processing and handling conditions of these products.
TI  - Intra-storm variability in microbial partitioning and microbial loading rates.
AB  - Association with particles in the water column can have a significant impact on microbial fate and transport. This study analyzed multiple stormwater samples taken throughout the duration of three separate storms (at two different sites) to evaluate the fraction of microbes partitioning to denser "settleable" particles and to examine how partitioning behavior varied over the course of a storm. Intra-storm sampling also allowed for estimates of microbial loading rates (both total and particle-associated) and cumulative storm-induced microbial load. Five different indicator organisms were examined, with the fraction of microbes associated with settleable particles assessed via a calibrated centrifugation method. Partitioning behavior varied across microorganism type, with an average of 40% of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci associating with settleable particles, compared to approximately 65% of Clostridium perfringens spores and only 13% of total coliphage. Partitioning remained fairly constant for each type of organism throughout storm events. Nonetheless, higher concentrations of both settleable particles and microbes entering the water column soon after the onset of a storm led to higher loading rates of settleable microbes in the storm's earliest stages, a trend that could have important implications for the design of stormwater management structures (e.g., detention basins). Estimates of cumulative storm-induced microbial loading suggested that one day's worth of storm loading can be the equivalent of months, or even years, of dry-weather loading.
TI  - [A study to assess the microbial contamination of Mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the St Lawrence River estuary, (Quebec, Canada)].
AB  - The aims of the present study were to assess the microbial quality of Mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the St. Lawrence River estuary and to validate various microbial indicator microorganisms of bivalve mollusks contamination. Clams were collected from nine sites, including four harvesting sites closed by virtue of the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP). Six contamination indicators (fecal coliforms, somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, fecal streptococci, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli) and four pathogens (Campylobacter sp., Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia sp., and Salmonella sp.) were identified in the clams. Indicators sensibility, specificity and predictive values with respect to the presence of pathogens were calculated. Pathogenic microorganisms detection frequency in clams was important (92%). Globally, pathogens tend to be less frequently detected in opened harvesting sites (p = 0.086). Although the assessed indicators were not perfect, when F-specific coliphages are associated with E. coli or fecal coliforms, a good sensibility (62%-64%) and good positive predictive value (88%) with respect to the investigated pathogens are obtained.
TI  - Use of a combination of brushing technique and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method as a novel, rapid, and safe system for detection of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Gastric mucosal biopsy is widely used in the detection of Helicobacter pylori but is associated with a number of problems, including false-negative results due to sampling error and massive bleeding after biopsy. Given the extended period required to culture H. pylori, detection would be further improved by the use of rapid detection methods such as PCR. Here, we developed a rapid, safe, and convenient method for collecting H. pylori which combines endoscopic brushing with the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. The specificity and sensitivity of LAMP were examined using nine urease-generating non-H. pylori bacterial species, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter hepaticus, and 51 H. pylori strains. Results showed that H. pylori-specific LAMP primers amplified H. pylori DNA only and that the lowest detection limit of the LAMP reaction was 10(2) CFU. Brushing and biopsy samples taken from 200 patients with peptic ulcer at Nagoya University Hospital and a regional health care center were subjected to both LAMP and culturing. No adverse effects such as severe bleeding or penetration occurred during the procedure. By LAMP assay, 123 patients were confirmed as H. pylori positive when brushing technique samples were assayed, whereas only 100 were positive when biopsy samples were assayed. Culture assay detected H. pylori in 117 patients when it was combined with the brushing technique and in 96 when it was combined with biopsy. Combination of the endoscopic brushing technique with LAMP is considered a useful and safe system for identifying H. pylori infection.
TI  - Sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - A sensitive rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. Using group- or species-specific primers for 16S or 23S rRNA, analytical curves were constructed for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an RNA amount of 10(-3) cell per RT-PCR. The number of bacteria in culture was determined by RT-qPCR, and the results correlated well with the CFU count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) CFU. The bacterial counts obtained by RT-qPCR were the same as the CFU counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for C. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and SYTO9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the RT-qPCR counts rather than with the CFU counts. The RT-qPCR method could detect endogenous Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for RT-qPCR quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. As only 5 h was needed for RT-qPCR quantification, we suggest that rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR assays provide a sensitive and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining their possible invasion of a host.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Microbial exposure assessment of an urban recreational lake: a case study of the  application of new risk-based guidelines.
AB  - New WHO and Australian guidelines promote a risk-management approach for minimising exposure to pathogens in recreational waters. Between 2003 and 2005, they were applied to Lake Parramatta (10 ha, 450 ML), a potential recreation site in Sydney, Australia. A three stage approach was developed involving (1) initial suitability assessment using historic data, (2) revised suitability assessment based on new data and (3) characterisation of hazardous (especially wet weather) events. Contrary to the stage 1 suitability classification, stage 2 baseline data indicated that during dry weather the lake had water quality sufficient for primary contact recreation (95th percentiles for enterococci = 19 MPN/100, n = 50) and the major pathogen source was wildfowl. Guideline principles provided a rationale for collecting microbiological and geographic data needed to understand local cycles of lake contamination/recovery. The concept of hazardous events was particularly useful. Studies of stormwater events led us to identify a transition point (> 10 mm rainfall in 24 h) where human-faecal pathogen risks increased and access needed to be controlled. Together baseline and event data yielded operational tools (i.e. event detection methods, action triggers, auditing criteria, remediation priorities) for minimising bather exposure.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting activity of active component isolated from Terminalia chebula fruits against intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of materials derived from the fruit of Terminalia  chebula was evaluated against six intestinal bacteria by means of an impregnated paper disk agar diffusion method. The butanol fraction of T. chebula extract had profound growth-inhibitory activity at a concentration of 5 mg per disk. The biologically active component isolated from the T. chebula fruits was identified with a variety of spectroscopic analyses as ethanedioic acid. The growth responses varied in accordance with the bacterial strain, chemical, and dosage tested. In a test with concentrations of 2 and 1 mg per disk, ethanedioic acid had strong and moderate inhibitory activity against Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli, respectively, with no associated adverse effects on the growth of the four tested lactic acid-producing bacteria. Ellagic acid derived from T. chebula fruits exerted a potent inhibitory effect against C. perfringens and E. coli, but little or no inhibition was observed with treatments of behenic acid, P-caryophyllene, eugenol, isoquercitrin, oleic acid, ca-phellandrene, 3-sitosterol, stearic acid, a-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol, terpinolene, or triacontanoic acid. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological properties of T. chebula fruits.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200.
AB  - Electrotransformation of Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200 was achieved using  the plasmid, pTE16, and a pUC-based suicide vector, pTEA2. The construct pTE16 is based on the Escherichia coli-Clostridium perfringens shuttle vector pJIR715 and contains a thermostable chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance cassette. Evidence supporting transformation was provided by extracting plasmid pTE16 from presumptive transformants of T. ethanolicus and by PCR specific to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene on the vector pTEA2. Transformation frequencies of plasmid pTE16 and pTEA2 were 50 +/- 7.4 and 30 +/- 4.2 transformants per mug plasmid DNA. The results provide the first unequivocal gene transfer method functional in T. ethanolicus.
TI  - Effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. However, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. Fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-O-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. Different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as Lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. This indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. Our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. The bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of salt (NaCl) used for the preservation of natural casings.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of salt (NaCl) used for the preservation of natural  casings were studied by investigating the survival of six bacterial species in natural casings at different water activity (aw) levels. Individual sheep casings were inoculated with ca. 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu) g(-1) of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and 10(2)cfu g(-1) of E. coli O157:H7. The casings were stored at 20+/-1.5 degrees C in different brines and dry salt, giving aw-levels of 0.90 aw, 0.87aw, 0.85 aw, 0.83 aw and 0.75 aw. Samples were taken at day 1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 20, 27 and 30 after inoculation and the number of bacteria present was determined. Based on survival curves, death rates (day(-1)) were calculated to quantify the reduction in log10 cfu g(-1) per day. The influence of aw on death rates was higher for Gram-negative bacteria than for Gram-positive bacteria. The death rates were overall higher for Gram-negatives than for Gram-positives. No clear reduction in the survival of C. perfringens in relation to any aw level was observed in this study. These results indicate that the antimicrobial properties of salt used for the preservation of natural casings are sufficient to reduce the bacterial contamination (except for Clostridium spores) well below acceptable levels at a water activity level of 0.85 or lower during a 30-day storage period.
TI  - Lessons from the organization of a proficiency testing program in food microbiology by interlaboratory comparison: analytical methods in use, impact of methods on bacterial counts and measurement uncertainty of bacterial counts.
AB  - The proficiency testing program in food microbiology RAEMA (Reseau d'Analyses et  d'Echanges en Microbiologie des Aliments), created in 1988, currently includes 450 participating laboratories. This interlaboratory comparison establishes proficiency in detection of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, as well as enumeration of aerobic micro-organisms, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, beta-glucuronidase-positive Escherichia coli, anaerobic sulfito-reducing bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and L. monocytogenes. Twice a year, five units samples are sent to participants to assess their precision and trueness for enumeration and detection of micro-organisms. Most of participating laboratories use standard or validated alternative methods, they were 50-70% in 1994 and, for 5 years, they are 95%. An increasing use of alternative methods was also observed. This phenomenon is all the more significant as standard methods are laborious and time consuming; thus, 50% of the laboratories use alternative methods for the detection of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. More and more laboratories use ready-to-use media and although the percentage is variable according to the microflora, we can consider that, today, 50-60% of the laboratories participating to the proficiency program only use ready-to-use media. The internal quality assurance programs lead also to an increasing use of media quality controls. The impact of analytical methods on bacterial counts was assessed by grouping together the results obtained by participating laboratories during the 10 last testing schemes from 1999 to 2003. The identified significant factors influencing enumeration results are variable from one microflora to another. Some of them significantly influence many microflora: the plating method (spiral plating or not) is influential for aerobic micro-organisms, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and staphylococci, the type of culture medium and the medium manufacturer is influential for aerobic micro-organisms, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, E. coli, anaerobic sulfito-reducing bacteria, staphylococci, and L. monocytogenes. Others are specific of some micro-organisms: the resuscitation broth for L. monocytogenes, the mode of medium preparation for staphylococci and the incubation temperature for C. perfringens. These effects lead generally to small differences of about 0.1 log10 cfu g(-1), except for the enumeration of anaerobic sulfito-reducing bacteria, where the difference reaches 0.7 log10 cfu g(-1). These results, although difficult to extrapolate to all actual situations, which associate numerous food constituents and physiological states of bacteria to detect or numerate, allow nevertheless the quantification of interlaboratory variations linked to the methods in use. The analysis of bacterial counts obtained by the laboratories participating to the RAEMA proficiency testing program allowed also to validate a formula to calculate the repeatability of bacterial counts and to estimate the between-laboratory uncertainties for the majority of micro-organisms enumerated in food microbiology. The repeatability uncertainty is only indirectly affected by the method in use but depends essentially on the number of counted colonies. On the other hand, the between-laboratory uncertainty varies with the enumeration method in use, this variability is relatively small for the enumerations calling for methods without colony confirmation, i.e. for the enumeration of aerobic micro-organisms, Enterobacteriaceae, 'total' and thermotolerant coliforms, beta-glucuronidase-positive E. coli and coagulase-positive staphylococci with the technique using the rabbit-plasma fibrinogen agar. For these methods, the average between-laboratory standard deviation is 0.17 log10 cfu g(-1). The between-laboratory uncertainty is, on the contrary, larger for more complex techniques. For the enumeration of coagulase-positive staphylococci with the Baird-Parker agar, the between-laboratory standard deviation is equal to 0.23 log10 cfu g(-1), it is equal to 0.28 log10 cfu g(-1) for the enumeration of L. monocytogenes, to 0.34 log10 cfu g(-1) for the enumeration of C. perfringens, and to 0.47 log10 cfu g(-1) for the enumeration of anaerobic sulfito-reducing bacteria.
TI  - Construction and analysis of chromosomal Clostridium difficile mutants.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an emerging nosocomial pathogen of increasing importance and virulence but our ability to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of C. difficile-associated disease has been limited because of a lack of tools for its genetic manipulation. We have now developed a reproducible method for the targeted insertional inactivation of chromosomal C. difficile genes. The approach relies on the observation that an Escherichia coli-Clostridium perfringens shuttle vector is unstable in C. difficile and can be used as a form of conditional lethal vector to deliver gene constructs to the chromosome. We have used this methodology to insertionally inactivate two putative response regulator genes, rgaR and rgbR, which encode proteins with similarity to the toxin gene regulator, VirR, from C. perfringens. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the C. difficile RgaR protein positively regulated four genes, including a putative agrBD operon. The RgaR protein was also purified and shown to bind specifically to sites that contained two consensus VirR boxes located just upstream of the putative promoters of these genes. The development of this methodology will significantly enhance our ability to use molecular approaches to develop a greater understanding of the ability of C. difficile to cause disease.
TI  - Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens, and Plesiomonas shigelloides in marine and freshwater invertebrates from coastal California ecosystems.
AB  - The coastal ecosystems of California are highly utilized by humans and animals, but the ecology of fecal bacteria at the land-sea interface is not well understood. This study evaluated the distribution of potentially pathogenic bacteria in invertebrates from linked marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems in central California. A variety of filter-feeding clams, mussels, worms, and crab tissues were selectively cultured for Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli-O157, Clostridium perfringens, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Vibrio spp. A longitudinal study assessed environmental risk factors for detecting these bacterial species in sentinel mussel batches. Putative risk factors included mussel collection near higher risk areas for livestock or human sewage exposure, adjacent human population density, season, recent precipitation, water temperature, water type, bivalve type, and freshwater outflow exposure. Bacteria detected in invertebrates included Salmonella spp., C. perfringens, P. shigelloides, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus. Overall, 80% of mussel batches were culture positive for at least one of the bacterial species, although the pathogens Campylobacter, E. coli-O157, and Salmonella were not detected. Many of the same bacterial species were also cultured from upstream estuarine and riverine invertebrates. Exposure to human sewage sources, recent precipitation, and water temperature were significant risk factors for bacterial detection in sentinel mussel batches. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that filter-feeding invertebrates along the coast concentrate fecal bacteria flowing from land to sea and show that the relationships between anthropogenic effects on coastal ecosystems and the environmental niches of fecal bacteria are complex and dynamic.
TI  - Comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
TI  - Real-time monitoring of the membrane-binding and insertion properties of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin anthrolysin O from Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - Bacillus anthracis has recently been shown to secrete a potently hemolytic/cytolytic protein that has been designated anthrolysin O (ALO). In this work, we initiated a study of this potential anthrax virulence factor in an effort to understand the membrane-binding properties of this protein. Recombinant anthrolysin O (rALO35-512) and two N-terminally truncated versions of ALO (rALO390-512 and rALO403-512) from B. anthracis were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The role of cholesterol in the cytolytic activity of ALO was probed in cellular cholesterol depletion assays using mouse and human macrophage-like lines, and also Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. Challenging the macrophage cells with rALO35-512, but not rALO390-512 or rALO403-512, resulted in cell death by lysis, with this cytolysis being abolished by depletion of the membrane cholesterol. Drosophila cells, which contain ergosterol as their major membrane sterol, were resistant to rALO-mediated cytolysis. In order to determine the molecular mechanism of this resistance, the interaction of rALO with model membranes comprised of POPC alone, or with a variety of structurally similar sterols including ergosterol, was probed using Biacore. Both rALO35-512 and rALO403-512 demonstrated robust binding to model membranes composed of POPC and cholesterol, with amount of protein bound proportional to the cholesterol content. Ergosterol supported greatly reduced binding of both rALO35-512 and rALO403-512, whereas other sterols tested did not support binding. The rALO403-512--membrane interaction demonstrated an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) in the low nanomolar range, whereas rALO35-512 exhibited complex kinetics likely due to the multiple events involved in pore formation. These results establish the pivotal role of cholesterol in the action of rALO. The biosensor method developed to measure ALO recognition of cholesterol in a membrane environment could be extended to provide a platform for the screening of inhibitors of other membrane-binding proteins and peptides.
TI  - A new type of bacterial sulfatase reveals a novel maturation pathway in prokaryotes.
AB  - Sulfatases are a highly conserved family of enzymes found in all three domains of life. To be active, sulfatases undergo a unique post-translational modification leading to the conversion of either a critical cysteine ("Cys-type" sulfatases) or a serine ("Ser-type" sulfatases) into a Calpha-formylglycine (FGly). This conversion depends on a strictly conserved sequence called "sulfatase signature" (C/S)XPXR. In a search for new enzymes from the human microbiota, we identified the first sulfatase from Firmicutes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis revealed that this enzyme undergoes conversion of its critical cysteine residue into FGly, even though it has a modified (C/S)XAXR sulfatase signature. Examination of the bacterial and archaeal genomes sequenced to date has identified many genes bearing this new motif, suggesting that the definition of the sulfatase signature should be expanded. Furthermore, we have also identified a new Cys-type sulfatase-maturating enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cysteine into FGly, in anaerobic conditions, whereas the only enzyme reported so far to be able to catalyze this reaction is oxygen-dependent. The new enzyme belongs to the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzyme superfamily and is related to the Ser-type sulfatase-maturating enzymes. This finding leads to the definition of a new enzyme family of sulfatase-maturating enzymes that we have named anSME (anaerobic sulfatase-maturating enzyme). This family includes enzymes able to maturate Cys-type as well as Ser-type sulfatases in anaerobic conditions. In conclusion, our results lead to a new scheme for the biochemistry of sulfatases maturation and suggest that the number of genes and bacterial species encoding sulfatase enzymes is currently underestimated.
TI  - Site-related airborne biological hazard and seasonal variations in two wastewater treatment plants.
AB  - Results of a study conducted to assess the degree of airborne bacterial contamination generated by two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with different treatment systems and evaluate the dispersion of potential pathogens, have been described. Aerosols samples were collected in summer and winter with an agar impact sampler from several plant sites. External upwind and downwind controls were also examined. Total colony-forming counts of mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria, actinomycetes and streptomycetes, Gram-negatives, coliforms and sulfite-reducers were determined. Selective media were used in order to detect pathogenic bacteria. The lowest concentrations of mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria were 8 and 28 CFU/m(3) in plants A and B respectively, the highest >40,000 CFU/m(3) in both plants. Strains of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. were isolated in some sites of the two plants. Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica and Legionella spp. were never detected. The activities involving nebulization and mechanical aeration of wastewaters and the sewage inflows have proved to be of greatest potential risk. In both plants, we found a statistically significant dependence of bacterial contamination on the season for many of the analyzed parameters but a clear seasonal trend could not be observed.
TI  - The bacterial quality of red meat and offal in Casablanca (Morocco).
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the bacteriological quality of beef (n = 52), lamb (n = 52) and beef offal (n = 52) marketed in Casablanca, Morocco. Meat and offal samples (n = 156), were collected randomly from butcheries, supermarkets, and slaughterhouses. Two sampling periods were considered, one during the hot season and the second one during the cold season. The samples were analyzed for the presence of the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella, and Listeria monocytogenes. Results indicated that counts of the aerobic plate count, and fecal coliforms were particularly high in all the samples analyzed. E. coli, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and C. perfringens were detected in 37.8, 16, and 4.5% of the meat samples, respectively. Neither Salmonella nor L. monocytogenes were isolated from meat samples. Approximately 26.9% of beef, 34.6% of lamb and 28.8% of beef offal samples contained bacteria above the maximum limits established by the Moroccan regulatory standards for meat and meat products. Seasonality and the distribution location significantly (p < 0.05) affected bacterial populations: the hot season and butcheries appeared to be cases where the highest populations of bacteria in meat were observed. These high levels of microbiological contamination attest the poor hygienic quality of meat and offal, possibly due to uncontrolled processing, storage, and handling of these products.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - The assessment of airborne bacterial contamination in three composting plants revealed site-related biological hazard and seasonal variations.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree of bacterial contamination generated by three Italian composting plants (1, 2 and 3) in two different seasons and to assess the health risk for the employees. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aerosols samples were collected with an agar impact sampler. Several plant sites and external upwind and downwind controls were examined. Total colony-forming counts of mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria, actinomycetes and streptomycetes, Gram-negatives, coliforms and sulfite-reducers were determined. Selective media were used in order to isolate pathogenic bacteria. The levels of total mesophilic and thermophilic micro-organisms ranged between 33 and >40,000 CFU m(-3) in plant 1, 39 and 18,700 CFU m(-3) in plant 2 and 261 and 6278 CFU m(-3) in plant 3. Strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens were also found. CONCLUSIONS: The plants monitored in this study have proved to be sources of aerosolized bacteria. The activities involving mechanical movement of the composting mass and the indoor activities were of greatest potential risk. In all the studied plants, a statistically significant dependence was found between the bacterial contamination and the season for some or almost all the analysed parameters, but a clear seasonal trend could not be observed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides broad evidence of bacterial aerosol dispersion and site-related biological hazards that may be useful to the regional government to implement regulations on worker safety in composting plants.
TI  - Detection of bovine torovirus in neonatal calf diarrhoea in Lower Austria and Styria (Austria).
AB  - Faeces of 230 calves with and without diarrhoea collected during the winter period 2004/2005 in 100 Austrian farms (Styria and Lower Austria) were examined for viral, bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens. Torovirus-specific nucleic acid confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was found in 12 of 230 calves (5.2%). Ten of these calves were clinically ill, several of them showing signs of dehydration and abnormal faecal consistency at the time of sampling. Computer assisted analysis of two nucleotide sequences obtained from Austrian bovine samples revealed 93% similarity to Breda strain, but only 71% or 52% similarity to Equine Berne or Porcine Markelo torovirus strains respectively. Phylogenetic analysis grouped Austrian torovirus samples into the Bovine torovirus cluster indicating the first detection of Bovine torovirus in Austria. In addition, the following agents were detected in bovine faecal samples: Bovine coronavirus, 25.7%; Escherichia coli, 17%; Cryptosporidium spp., 11.7%; Eimeria spp., 10.4%; Rotavirus, 9.1%; Clostridium perfringens, 9.1% and Giardia spp., 6.1%. Salmonella spp. was not detected.
TI  - Selection of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus strains towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacilli were isolated from chicken gastrointestinal tract and examined for their potentially probiotic properties towards their inhibitory activity against poultry enteropathogenic bacteria. Biochemical tests, ITS-PCR and cell wall protein analysis were used to characterize the Lactobacillus isolates. The identification of isolated Lactobacillus strains based on phenotypic properties was not always satisfactory. ITS-PCR together with protein profile were found to be helpful in strain identification. Lactobacilli were tested for the inhibitory activity against selected strains of poultry enteropathogenic bacteria (Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens). Examined supernatants from Lactobacillus broth cultures demonstrated major antimicrobial activity against C. perfringens. Lower antimicrobial activity were observed against E. coli and Salmonella Enteritidis. The strongest inhibition effect were obtained using supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain 3D. Results received from this study confirmed that identification of Lactobacillus spp. is often tedious. Some isolates, which are in vitro antagonistic against enteropathogenic bacteria may be considered as potential candidates for poultry probiotics, especially in controlling necrotic enteritis caused by C. perfringens.
TI  - [Microbial indicators and fresh water quality assessment].
AB  - Traditionally, the microbiological quality of waters has been measured by the analysis of indicator microorganisms. The article reviews the sanitary significance of traditional indicators of faecal contamination (total coliforms, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci) and points out their limits. For some characteristics Escherichia coli may be considered a more useful indicator then faecal coliforms and recently it has been included in all recent laws regarding fresh, marine and drinking water. A clearer taxonomic definition of faecal streptococci evidenced the difficulty into defining a specific standard methodology of enumeration and suggested the more suitable role of enterococci as indicator microorganisms. Several current laws require the detection of enterococci. The resistance of Clostridium perfringens spores may mean that they would serve as a useful indicator of the sanitary quality of sea sediments.
TI  - Cloning of alpha-beta fusion gene from Clostridium perfringens and its expression.
AB  - AIM: To study the cloning of alpha-beta fusion gene from Clostridium perfringens  and the immunogenicity of alpha-beta fusion expression. METHODS: Cloning was accomplished after PCR amplification from strains NCTC64609 and C58-1 of the protective antigen genes of alpha-toxin and beta-toxin. The fragment of the gene was cloned using plasmid pZCPAB. This fragment coded for the gene with the stable expression of alpha-beta fusion gene binding. In order to verify the exact location of the alpha-beta fusion gene, domain plasmids were constructed. The two genes were fused into expression vector pBV221. The expressed alpha-beta fusion protein was identified by ELISA, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and neutralization assay. RESULTS: The protective alpha-toxin gene (cpa906) and the beta-toxin gene (cpb930) were obtained. The recombinant plasmid pZCPAB carrying alpha-beta fusion gene was constructed and transformed into BL21(DE3). The recombinant strain BL21(DE3)(pZCPAB) was obtained. After the recombinant strain BL21(DE3)(pZCPAB) was induced by 42 degC, its expressed product was about 22.14% of total cellular protein at SDS-PAGE and thin-layer gel scanning analysis. Neutralization assay indicated that the antibody induced by immunization with alpha-beta fusion protein could neutralize the toxicity of alpha-toxin and beta-toxin. CONCLUSION: The obtained alpha-toxin and beta-toxin genes are correct. The recombinant strain BL21(DE3)(pZCPAB) could produce alpha-beta fusion protein. This protein can be used for immunization and is immunogenic. The antibody induced by immunization with alpha-beta fusion protein could neutralize the toxicity of alpha-toxin and beta-toxin.
TI  - Cloning, recombinant production, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of a family 84 glycoside hydrolase from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a ubiquitous environmental organism that is capable of causing a variety of diseases in mammals, including gas gangrene and necrotic enteritis in humans. The activity of a secreted hyaluronidase, attributed to the NagH protein, contributes to the pathogenicity of this organism. The family 84 catalytic module of one of the three homologues of NagH found in C. perfringens (ATCC 13124) has been cloned. The 69 kDa catalytic module of NagJ, here called GH84C, was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC). Crystals belonging to space group I222 or I2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit-cell parameters a = 130.39, b = 150.05, c = 155.43 A were obtained that diffracted to 2.1 A. Selenomethionyl crystals have also been produced, leading to the possibility of solving the phase problem by MAD using synchrotron radiation.
TI  - A randomized controlled trial assessing infectious disease risks from bathing in  fresh recreational waters in relation to the concentration of Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and somatic coliphages.
AB  - We performed epidemiologic studies at public freshwater bathing sites in Germany  to provide a better scientific basis for the definition of recreational water quality standards. A total of 2,196 participants were recruited from the local population and randomized into bathers and nonbathers. Bathers were exposed for 10 min and had to immerse their head at least three times. Water samples for microbiological analysis were collected at 20-min intervals. Unbiased concentration-response effects with no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were demonstrated for three different definitions of gastroenteritis and four fecal indicator organisms. Relative risks for bathing in waters with levels above NOAELs compared with nonbathing ranged from 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6) to 4.6 (95% CI, 2.1-10.1), depending on the definition of gastroenteritis. The effect of swallowing water provided additional evidence for true dose-response relationships. Based on the NOAELs, the following guide values for water quality are suggested: 100 Escherichia coli, 25 intestinal enterococci, 10 somatic coliphages, or 10 Clostridium perfringens per 100 mL. Recreational water quality standards are intended to protect the health of those consumers who are not already immune or resistant to pathogens that may be associated with indicator organisms. In contrast to current World Health Organization recommendations, we concluded that standards should be based on rates of compliance with NOAELs rather than on attributable risks determined above NOAELs, because these risks depend mainly on the unpredictable susceptibility of the cohorts. Although in theory there is no threshold in real concentration-response relationships, we demonstrated that a NOAEL approach would be a more robust and practical solution to the complex problem of setting standards.
TI  - The stability of micro-organisms preserved in LENTICULE discs, demonstrated by repeat sample distributions of the EQUAL Scheme for Indicator Organisms (water microbiology).
AB  - AIMS: To demonstrate the stability of microorganisms preserved in LENTICULE discs, employed by the EQUAL Scheme for Indicator Organisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five sample batches containing several indicator organism parameters were each despatched in two separate distributions at intervals of up to 24 months apart. A comparison of participants' median counts and bar charts of their cumulated results was then made. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that LENTICULE discs provided a remarkably stable preparation format for the maintenance of viable organisms in reproducible numbers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Complex mixtures of organisms can be maintained in stable numbers for extended periods of time at a freezer temperature of -20 degrees C and satisfactorily transported without the requirement for cold chain conditions.
TI  - Fecal contamination of agricultural soils before and after hurricane-associated flooding in North Carolina.
AB  - Hurricane Floyd and other storms in 1999 caused widespread and extensive flooding of eastern North Carolina and environmental contamination with fecal wastes from municipal wastewater and livestock operations. Because wastewater contains high levels of pathogenic micro-organisms, principal health risks to humans from flooding are consumption of crops grown in fecally contaminated soil and ingestion of contaminated water. Flood waters polluted with microbial and other contaminants also may be detrimental to the health of livestock and plant crops. In the present study, agricultural soils impacted by flood waters were analyzed for bacterial and viral indicators of fecal contamination. Total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, spores of Clostridium perfringens, and both male specific (F+) and somatic coliphages were recovered from soil and assayed in liquid culture media. A number of samples were positive for the presence of fecal coliforms, E. coli, and coliphages, indicating the presence of human or animal feces. Most samples were positive for total coliforms, and almost all samples contained high levels of Cl. perfringens spores. The levels of Cl. perfringens spores were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in flooded soil (post-Hurricane Floyd) compared to pre-flood soil. Persistent fecal contamination of soil, as demonstrated by the high levels of Cl. perfringens spores, suggests the need for additional or alternative measures to protect crop-growing areas, including prospective microbiological monitoring and improved protection of watersheds from incidents capable of releasing fecal material.

TI  - Diarrhea in American infants and young children in the community setting: incidence, clinical presentation and microbiology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characteristics and microbiology of the full spectrum of pediatric diarrhea occurring in the U.S. community setting are not well-understood. METHODS: Six-month prospective cohort study of 604 healthy 6- to 36-month-old children recruited by the Slone Center Office-based Research Network. RESULTS: The incidence of parent-defined diarrhea was 2.2 episodes per person-year. The median duration of diarrhea was 2 days with a median of 6 stools per episode. Outpatient visits and hospitalization were prompted by 9.7 and 0.3% of episodes, respectively. The most common microorganisms identified in healthy baseline stools were atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (12.2%), enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (3.7%), Clostridium difficile (3.5%) and Clostridium perfringens (2.9%), and each of these was no more common in diarrhea stools. In contrast, all of the viruses analyzed were more prevalent in diarrhea specimens than in baseline specimens: enteric adenovirus (5.7% diarrhea versus 1.4% baseline), rotavirus (5.2% versus 1.4%), astrovirus (3.5% versus 1.4%), Sapporo-like virus (3.0% versus 0.8%) and norovirus (1.9% versus 0.8%). A likely pathogen was detected in 20.6% of diarrhea specimens. Vomiting and > or =16 stools in an episode were predictive of isolating a pathogen from the stool, each with a relative risk of approximately 2. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy young children in this study experienced more than 2 cases of diarrhea per person-year, but most were brief and do not require medical attention. Although most diarrhea-associated pathogens were viruses, no likely pathogen was found in almost 80% of cases; possible etiologies for these cases include currently unknown gastrointestinal infections, nongastrointestinal illnesses and dietary/environmental factors.
TI  - [Symptoms of food-borne diseases and gastroenteritis in Kyushu, Japan].
AB  - In this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: Norovirus, Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shigella sonnei/flexneri (Shigella), Staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type Bacillus cereus. The symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of Kyushu between January 2000 and December 2004 were recorded. The pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was B. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by S. aureus (3.3 h), C. perfringens (10.7 h) and V. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). All the patients infected with B. cereus and S. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. Bloody diarrhea was associated with STEC and Shigella, but rare with other pathogens. Vomiting was associated with almost all cases of S. aureus and B. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the Norovirus cases and 56.1% of the V. parahaemolyticus cases. Vomiting was less common in the C. perfringens (22.0%) and the ETEC and STEC (both about 5%). Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with STEC 0157 infection than with STEC non-0157 infection. Since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.
TI  - Evaluation of different methods for nucleic acids quantification.
AB  
TI  - Relative value of surrogate indicators for detecting pathogens in lakes and reservoirs.
AB  - This study investigated the relative behavior of pathogens, fecal indicator organisms, and particles of varying size during transport through a reservoir following a storm event inflow in Myponga Reservoir, South Australia. During the inflow, samples were collected from the river and at various locations within the reservoir to determine the fate and transport of microroganisms as they progressed through the water body. Microbiological analysis included the indicator organisms Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, aerobic spores, and somatic coliphages, the protozoan pathogens Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp., and the potential physical surrogates of pathogen contamination including particle size and turbidity. Of the microbial indicator groups, C. perfringens spores were the most highly correlated with Cryptosporidium spp. concentrations (Spearman Rho = 0.58), closely followed by enterococci (Spearman Rho = 0.57). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were predominantly associated with small sized particles (range of 14.3-27.7 microm). All of the microbial indicator groups tested were associated with larger sized particle ranges (> 63.3 microm) except C. perfringens spores which were associated with particles in the size range of 45.5-63.3 microm. Although indicators may rank correlate with Cryptosporidium spp., the variation in settling rates of different microorganisms has significant implications for the use of surrogates to estimate pathogen attenuation within reservoirs. For example, concentrations of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were reduced by a factor of 3 on reaching the dam wall, whereas enterococci were reduced by a factor of 10.
TI  - Transport of MS2 phage, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia intestinalis in a gravel and a sandy soil.
AB  - To define protection zones around groundwater abstraction wells and safe setback  distances for artificial recharge systems in watertreatment, quantitative information is needed about the removal of microorganisms during soil passage. Column experiments were conducted using natural soil and water from an infiltration site with fine sandy soil and a river bank infiltration site with gravel soil. The removal of phages, bacteria, bacterial spores, and protozoan (oo)-cysts was determined at two velocities and compared with field data from the same sites. The microbial elimination rate (MER) in both soils was generally >2 log, but MER in the gravel soil was higher than that in the fine sandy soil. This was attributed to enhanced attachment, related to higher metal-hydroxides content. From the high sticking efficiencies (>1) and the low influence of flow rate on MER it was deduced that straining played a significant role in the removal of Escherichia coli and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in the gravel soil. Lower removal of oocysts than the 4-5 times smaller E. coli and spores in the fine sand indicates that the contribution of straining is variable and needs further attention in transport models. Thus, simple extrapolation of grain size and particle size to the extent of microbial transport underground is inappropriate. Finally, the low MER of indigenous E. coli and Clostridium perfringens observed in the soil columns as well as under field conditions and the second breakthrough peak found for Cryptosporidium and spores in the fine sandy soil upon a change in the feedwater pH indicate a significant role of detachment and retardation to microbial transport and the difficulty of extrapolation of quantitative column test results to field conditions.
TI  - Live attenuated vaccine-based control of necrotic enteritis of broiler chickens.
AB  - A vaccine for necrotic enteritis (NE) of chickens would reduce the current need to prevent or treat the disease in broiler chickens with antimicrobial drugs. The objective of this study was to understand aspects of immunity to the disease. The first experiment examined the virulence of six strains of Clostridium perfringens isolated from cases of NE in broiler chickens. Using a 5-day experimental oral infection of 2-week-old broiler chickens, four of the six strains were found to be virulent. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and PCR showed that virulence was not associated with a plasmid encoding the beta2 toxin gene, cpb2, since this was present in virulent and one of the two avirulent strains. In the second experiment, two virulent and one avirulent strains were tested for their ability to immunize ("infection-immunization") chickens through the oral route. The procedure used experimental infection for 5 days followed by bacitracin treatment for 9 days, and then re-challenge 2 days later with a virulent strain, CP4. Infection-immunization with the virulent isolates protected chickens from subsequent virulent challenge, whereas the infection-immunization with the avirulent isolate did not. In a third experiment, two of four alpha-toxin-negative mutants of CP4 protected birds from experimental NE after oral immunization. These two mutants were also attenuated for virulence. We conclude that it is possible to immunize chickens successfully against NE and that immunogen(s) other than alpha-toxin are important in protective immunity against oral infection.
TI  - [Study of real-time PCR assays for rapid detection of food-borne pathogens].
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit was evaluated for detection of 8 of 19 species of food-borne pathogens, including Plesiomonas shigelloides, Providencia alcalifaciens, in five stool specimens. The time frame was within 2h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 22 pairs of specific primers. The rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes were determined by this LC-PCR assay from 10 cases of food-borne outbreaks in Shimane Prefecture from 2002 to 2005. These cases included Campylobacter jejuni (4), Clostridium perfringens (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and astA positive E. coli (1), and astA positive E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli 026, and Bacillus cereus (1 each). Rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of food-or water-borne pathogenic bacteria in fecal samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food-borne outbreaks.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activities of essential oil from the leaves of Sesuvium portulacastrum.
AB  - Sesuvium portulacastrum has long been used as a remedy for fever and scurvy. Hydrodistillation was used to extract the essential oil from the fresh leaves of Sesuvium portulacastrum. The essential oil yield obtained was 0.15%. Using GC-MS analysis, alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, alpha-terpinene, O-cymene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, alpha-terpinene, bornyl acetate, tridecane, trans-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene were identified. The hole plate diffusion method was used for antibacterial testing. The essential oil exhibited antibacterial activity against Acetobacter calcoacetica, Bacillus subtillis, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhii, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The mycelium growth inhibition method was used for the antifungal testing. The oil exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium notatum. Using the beta-carotene, acetone and linoleic acid method for the antioxidant testing, the essential oil showed antioxidant activity threshold of 15.9 mm mean zone of color retention.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 with some plasmids.
AB  - Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 was transformed with several shuttle plasmids constructed for Clostridium acetobutylicum-Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens-E. coli by electroporation. The Clostridium stercorarium xylanase gene xyn10B was successfully expressed in C. paraputrificum M-21 and the expressed protein did not suffer from proteolysis by host protease(s). This system will provide us with a genetic tool for genetic and metabolic engineering of this bacterium.
TI  - A new type of beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase from hydrogen-producing Clostridium paraputrificum M-21.
AB  - A beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase gene (nag84A) was cloned from Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 in Escherichia coli. The nag84A gene consists of an open reading frame of 4647 by encoding 1549 amino acids, with a deduced molecular weight of 174,311, which have a catalytic domain belonging to family 84 of the glycoside hydrolases. Nag84A was purified from a recombinant E. coli and characterized. Although Nag84A exhibited high homology to the hyaluronidase from Clostridium perfringens, it did not degrade hyluronic acid. The enzyme hydrolyzed chitooligomers such as di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-N-acetylchitohexaose, and synthetic substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminide [4-MU-(G1cNAc)], but did not hydrolyze 4-MU-beta-D-glucoside, 4-MU-alpha-D-glycoside, 4-MU-alpha-D-GlcNAc, 4-MU-alpha-D-galactoside, 4-MU-beta-D-xyloside, PNP-beta-D-galactoside, and PNP-alpha-D-xyloside. The enzyme was optimally active at 50 degrees C and pH 6.5, and the apparent K(m) and V(max) values for 4-MU-(GlcNAc) were 8.5 microM and 1.39 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. SDS-PAGE, zymogram, and immunological analyses suggested that Nag84A was inducible by ball-milled chitin. Since Nag84A has a high molecular weight with a family 84 catalytic domain with high homology to hyaluronidases but no hyaluronidase activity, the enzyme is a novel beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase different from others reported having low molecular weights and belonging to family 3 and family 18.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin against anaerobes studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of moxifloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) were studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model. Initially, a dose-ranging study with area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC ratios of 6.7 to 890 was used to investigate the effect of anaerobic conditions on the AUC/MIC antibacterial effect (ABE) relationship with Escherichia coli. The AUC/MIC ratios for 50% and 90% effects, using a log CFU drop at 24 h as the antibacterial effect measure, were 34 and 59, respectively, aerobic and 54 and 96, respectively, anaerobic. These values are not significantly different. Dose ranging at AUC/MIC ratios of 9 to 216 against the anaerobes indicated a differing AUC/MIC ABE pattern, and the AUC/MICs for 50% and 90% effects were lower: for B. fragilis, they were 10.5 and 25.7, respectively; for C. perfringens, they were 8.6 and 16.2; and for GPAC, they were 7.3 and 17.4. The maximum-effect log drops were as follows: for B. fragilis, -3.2 +/- 0.2 logs; for C. perfringens, -3.7 +/- 0.1 logs; and for GPAC, -2.5 +/- 0.1 logs. Although the anaerobes were not eradicated, there was no emergence of resistance. Comparison of the ABE of moxifloxacin to that of ertapenem against B. fragilis indicated that moxifloxacin was superior at 24 h and 48 h. In contrast, ertapenem was superior to moxifloxacin against GPAC at 24 h and 48 h and against C. perfringens at 48 h. Both drugs performed equivalently against C. perfringens at 24 h. Monte Carlo simulations using human serum AUC data and an AUC/MIC anaerobe target of 7.5 suggests a >90% target achievement at MICs of <2 mg/liter. This divides the B. fragilis wild-type MIC distribution. The pharmacodynamic properties of moxifloxacin against anaerobes are different than those against aerobic species. The clinical implications of these differences need further exploration.
TI  - [Emphysematous cystitis due to Clostridium perfringens--a localised infection in  a man with generalized melanoma].
AB  - Emphysematous cystitis was found at autopsy of a 47-year-old man suffering from generalised malignant melanoma. Bacteriological cultures from the urinary bladder showed Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Clostridium perfringens type A, toxic strain. The histological examination revealed cystic dilatation of lymphatic vessels both in bladder mucosa and muscularis propria. There were multinucleated macrophages in the lining of some of these cystic spaces and a few Gram-positive rods inside their lumina. In the mucosal and submucosal connective tissue there were signs of chronic inflammation and, focally, small haemorrhages. We suppose that the gas production was due to the presence of Clostridium perfringens and believe that the infection of the urinary bladder occurred in relation to the repeated insertion of the catheter into the bladder of a patient with secondary immunosuppression. Emphysematous cystitis was, in our case, a localised clostridial infection without clinical and morphological signs of generalised septicaemia.
TI  - Unhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed konjac glucomannans modulated cecal and fecal microflora in Balb/c mice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The prebiotic role of intact konjac glucomannan (KGM) is contradictory. Short-chain glucomannan may cause a greater or faster effect on colonic microflora compared with KGM. Therefore, time-course and dose-dependent studies were conducted to examine and compare effects of unhydrolyzed KGM with those of acid-hydrolyzed glucomannan (KH) on cecal and fecal microflora. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations in cecal content were also determined. METHODS: Seven-week-old male Balb/c mice were fed 5% (w/w) cellulose and KGM or KH diets for 2 or 4 wk in a time-course study. Cecal total anaerobes, bifidobacteria, Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli counts, and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were determined. In a subsequent dose-dependent study, Balb/c mice were fed AIN-93 fiber-free diets supplemented with 2.5%, 5%, or 7.5% of KGM or KH for 4 wk. Anaerobes, bifidobacteria, C. perfringens, and E. coli were enumerated in the cecal content and feces. RESULTS: KGM and KH significantly increased cecal anaerobes and bifidobacteria counts at weeks 2 and 4, respectively, compared with cellulose. In contrast, KGM and KH significantly decreased cecal C. perfringens counts only at week 4. Acetate and propionate concentrations in cecal contents were increased by KGM and KH diets at weeks 2 and 4, respectively. In the dose-dependent study, KH increased cecal bifidobacteria counts only at the 2.5% level but increased fecal bifidobacteria count and suppressed C. perfringens counts at each dose level as compared with KGM. CONCLUSION: Hydrolyzed glucomannan exerts a greater prebiotic effect than does KGM in Balb/c mice.
TI  - Infectious agents associated with epizootic rabbit enteropathy: isolation and attempts to reproduce the syndrome.
AB  - Epizootic rabbit enteropathy (ERE), a highly lethal (30-80% mortality) disease of broiler rabbits aged 6-14 weeks, first appeared in 1997 in French intensive enclosed rabbitries and is of unknown aetiology. Bacteriological, virological and parasitical examination of the intestinal contents of rabbits that had died either in spontaneous field cases or after experimental reproduction of ERE, were undertaken in an attempt to identify infectious agents that may play a role in the disease. Two bacterial strains, Clostridium perfringens and non-enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were repeatedly isolated at high faecal counts from naturally infected animals. In field cases, a correlation between typical gross lesions of epizootic enteropathy and the presence of the alpha toxin of Cl. perfringens was observed (P<0.0001; Chi-squared test). Although attempts to reproduce the disease by inoculation with different pools of cultivable bacterial strains failed, the disease was successfully reproduced by inoculation with one French and two Belgian samples of caecal contents.
TI  - 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based studies of the metabolism of food-borne carcinogen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline by human intestinal microbiota.
AB  - 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) is a mutagenic/carcinogenic compound formed from meat and fish during cooking. Following ingestion, IQ is metabolized mainly by liver xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, but intestinal bacteria may also contribute to its biotransformation. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of IQ by the human intestinal microbiota. Following incubation of IQ (200 microM) under anoxic conditions with 100-fold dilutions of stools freshly collected from three healthy volunteers, we quantified residual IQ by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and characterized the production of IQ metabolites by in situ (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopic analysis of crude incubation media. In addition, we looked for IQ-degrading bacteria by screening collection strains and by isolating new strains from the cecal contents of human-microbiota-associated rats gavaged with IQ on a regular basis. HPLC and (1)H-NMR analyses showed that the three human microbiota degraded IQ with different efficiencies (range, 50 to 91% after 72 h of incubation) and converted it into a unique derivative, namely, 7-hydroxy-IQ. We found 10 bacterial strains that were able to perform this reaction: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 2), Clostridium clostridiiforme (n = 3), Clostridium perfringens (n = 1), and Escherichia coli (n = 4). On the whole, our results indicate that bacteria belonging to the predominant communities of the human intestine are able to produce 7-hydroxy-IQ from IQ. They also suggest interindividual differences in the ability to perform this reaction. Whether it is a metabolic activation is still a matter of debate, since 7-hydroxy-IQ has been shown to be a direct-acting mutagen in the Ames assay but not carcinogenic in laboratory rodents.
TI  - Identification and molecular cloning of a novel glycoside hydrolase family of core 1 type O-glycan-specific endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - We found endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in most bifidobacterial strains, which are predominant bacteria in the human colon. This enzyme catalyzes the liberation of galactosyl beta1,3-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Galbeta1,3GalNAc) alpha-linked to serine or threonine residues from mucin-type glycoproteins. The gene (engBF) encoding the enzyme has been cloned from Bifidobacterium longum JCM 1217. The protein consisted of 1,966 amino acid residues, and the central domain (590-1381 amino acid residues) exhibited 31-53% identity to hypothetical proteins of several bacteria including Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli liberated Galbeta1,3GalNAc disaccharide from Galbeta1,3GalNAcalpha1pNP and asialofetuin, but did not release GalNAc, Galbeta1,3(GlcNAcbeta1,6)GalNAc, GlcNAcbeta1,3GalNAc, and Galbeta1,3GlcNAc from each p-nitrophenyl (pNP) substrate, and also did not release sialo-oligosaccharides from fetuin, indicating its strict substrate specificity for the Core 1-type structure. The stereochemical course of hydrolysis was determined by (1)H NMR and was found to be retention. Site-directed mutagenesis of a total of 22 conserved Asp and Glu residues suggested that Asp-682 and Asp-789 are critical residues for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The enzyme also exhibited transglycosylation activity toward various mono- and disaccharides and 1-alkanols, demonstrating its potential to synthesize neoglycoconjugates. This is the first report for the isolation of a gene encoding endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from any organisms and for the establishment of a new glycoside hydrolase family (GH family 101).
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Synergy in polymicrobial infections in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.
AB  - Human diabetics frequently suffer delayed wound healing, increased susceptibility to localized and systemic infections, and limb amputations as a consequence of the disease. Lower-limb infections in diabetic patients are most often polymicrobial, involving mixtures of aerobic, facultative anaerobic, and anaerobic bacteria. The purpose of this study is to determine if these organisms contribute to synergy in polymicrobial infections by using diabetic mice as an in vivo model. The model was the obese diabetic mouse strain BKS.Cg-m +/+ Lepr(db)/J, a model of human type 2 diabetes. Young (5- to 6-week-old) prediabetic mice and aged (23- to 24-week-old) diabetic mice were compared. The mice were injected subcutaneously with mixed cultures containing Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens. Progression of the infection (usually abscess formation) was monitored by examining mice for bacterial populations and numbers of white blood cells at 1, 8, and 22 days postinfection. Synergy in the mixed infections was defined as a statistically significant increase in the number of bacteria at the site of injection when coinfected with a second bacterium, compared to when the bacterium was inoculated alone. E. coli provided strong synergy to B. fragilis but not to C. perfringens. C. perfringens and B. fragilis provided moderate synergy to each other but only in young mice. B. fragilis was anergistic (antagonistic) to E. coli in coinfections in young mice at 22 days postinfection. When age-matched nondiabetic mice (C57BLKS/J) were used as controls, the diabetic mice exhibited 5 to 35 times the number of CFU as did the nondiabetic mice, indicating that diabetes was a significant factor in the severity of the polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Enumeration of specific bacterial populations in complex intestinal communities using quantitative PCR based on the chaperonin-60 target.
AB  - We used qPCR and the target gene chaperonin-60 (cpn60) to enumerate Clostridium perfringens genomes in DNA extracts from contents of the chicken gastrointestinal tract with the aim of optimizing this methodology to enumerate any bacterium of interest. To determine the most accurate protocols for determining target species abundance, we compared various DNA extraction methods in combination with four methods for producing standard curves. Factors affecting accuracy included the co-purification of PCR inhibitors and/or fluorescence quenchers and the yield of target DNA in the extract. Anion exchange chromatography of the spiked test samples enabled accurate enumeration of C. perfringens using a standard curve comprised of a plasmid containing a fragment of C. perfringens cpn60. We used qPCR to enumerate C. perfringens and other intestinal bacteria in ileum and cecum samples from chickens that had been challenged with C. perfringens and compared the results with viable counts on corresponding selective agars. We conclude that qPCR-based molecular enumeration of target species in the gastrointestinal tract is feasible, but care must be taken in order to mitigate the effects of confounding factors that can affect the apparent cell count.
TI  - Decrease of enteric micro-organisms from rural sewage sludge during their composting in straw mixture.
AB  - AIMS: To study the decrease of enteric micro-organisms including viable nematode  eggs, enteroviruses, faecal indicators (Escherichia coli and enterococci) and pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella sp. and Clostridium perfringens) of a rural sewage sludge when it is composted for 7 months in mixture with straw. METHODS AND RESULTS: Numbers of the test organisms and the physico-chemical parameters were measured on a monthly basis on the mixture, on the compost after being turned, and on the pile in three positions representing the part by which air is incoming, the bottom of the pile and the part through which air is outgoing. The lowest temperature in the pile was observed at the bottom, where it did not exceed 50 degrees C against 66 degrees C in the two other areas. There were no significant differences between the three areas in terms of micro-organism survival. Infectious enteroviruses were inactivated rapidly and were not found after the first turning whereas some genomes were detected until after the third turning. Escherichia coli and enterococci presented a similar survival rate and their number decreased by 4 log(10) whereas Salmonella decayed at a greater rate than L. monocytogenes. The numbers of C. perfringens decreased gradually to reach a final concentration in the mature compost of about 10(2) CFU g(-1) dry matter (d.m.), which was similar to that of the faecal indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The hygienic effect of sludge composting in mixture with straw results in a significant reduction of enteric micro-organisms, the concentration of the faecal indicators in the final product being < 64 most probable number g(-1) d.m. The concentrations of Salmonella, enteroviruses and viable nematode eggs in the final product were not detectable which is in accordance with the French legislation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results which pointed out the different behaviour of the test micro-organisms reflect the difficulty to propose a relevant indicator of hygienization. Otherwise, they show that composting is an efficient means for hygienization of sludge of rural wastewater treatment, where the straw is available close to their place of production.
TI  - Role of C-terminal regions of the C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens  enterotoxin in its interaction with claudin-4.
AB  - Claudin family proteins, which contain 4 transmembrane domains, play a pivotal role in the barrier function of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial sheets. We previously found that a modulator of claudin-4, the C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE), is a potent enhancer of jejunal drug absorption in rats. But the effects of C-CPE on the barrier function of TJs have never been fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of C-CPE on the barrier function of TJs in Caco-2 monolayer and characterized the functional domain of C-CPE that is responsible for interaction with claudin-4. To evaluate the effects of C-CPE on the barrier function of TJs, we measured transepithelial electric resistance (TER) in Caco-2 monolayer cells seeded onto polycarbonate filters. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with C-CPE resulted in a decrease in TER. But, deletion of the 30 C-terminal amino acids of C-CPE, which is the putative binding domain for claudin, attenuated the decrease in TER values. Moreover, ablation of the 16 C-terminal amino acids of C-CPE also resulted in attenuation of the decrease in TER values. The C-terminal-deleted C-CPEs did not interact with claudin-4 or the extracellular domain 2 of claudin-4, which is the C-CPE binding site. These results suggest that the 16 C-terminal amino acids of C-CPE are responsible for the interaction of C-CPE and claudin-4 following the disruption of TJ barrier function.
TI  - Microbial quality of runoff following land application of cattle manure and swine slurry.
AB  - Concentrations of human health-related microorganisms in runoff from agricultural plots (0.75 m x 2 m) treated with fresh and aged cattle manure, swine slurry and no manure (control) were determined. Three consecutive simulated rainfall events, producing 35 mm rainfall and separated by 24 h, were carried out for each plot. Fecal indicator (Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and coliphage) loads released in rainfall runoff from plots treated with fresh cattle manure, aged cattle manure and swine slurry treatments ranged from 5.52 x 10(5) to 4.36 x 10(9), 3.92 x 10(4) to 4.86 x 10(8), and 9.63 x 10(5) to 3.05 x 10(8), respectively. Plot runoff concentrations of protozoa (Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts) ranged from 1.65 x 10(5) to 1.04 x 10(6), 2.93 x 10(3) to 2.75 x 10(5), and 9.12 x 10(4) to 3.58 x 10(6) for fresh cattle manure, aged cattle manure and swine slurry plot treatments, respectively. These results suggest that large microbial loads could be released via heavy precipitation events that produce runoff from livestock manure-applied agricultural fields, of even modest size, and could have a significant impact on water bodies within the watershed. Because of the lack of multiplication in the environment, highly elevated concentrations in manured land runoff, and correlation to protozoan parasite presence, Clostridium may be an alternative indicator for livestock manure contamination.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  - The coordination of food sampling activities across Wales, a part of the United Kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. This surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. The food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. For all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for Escherichia coli, and 0.5% for Listeria spp. Overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. No Campylobacter-positive samples and only one Salmonella-positive sample were found. The analysis of the results show that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current United Kingdom guidelines. The information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of commercial canine and feline raw diets.
AB  - Twenty-five commercial raw diets for dogs and cats were evaluated bacteriologically. Coliforms were present in all diets, ranging from 3.5 x 10(3) to 9.4 x 10(6) CFU/g (mean 8.9 x 10(5); standard deviation 1.9 x 10(6)). Escherichia coli was identified in 15/25 (64%) diets; however, E. coli O157 was not detected. Salmonella spp. were detected in 5/25 (20%) diets; 1 each of beef-, lamb-, quail-, chicken-, and ostrich-based diets. Sporeforming bacteria were identified from 4/25 (16%) samples on direct culture and 25/25 (100%) samples using enrichment culture. Clostridium perfringens was identified in 5/25 (20%) samples. A toxigenic strain of C. difficile was isolated from one turkey-based food. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 1/25 (4%) diets. Campylobacter spp. were not isolated from any of the diets.
TI  - A national study on the residential impact of biological aerosols from the land application of biosolids.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the community risk of infection from bioaerosols to residents living near biosolids land application sites. METHODS AND RESULTS: Approximately 350 aerosol samples from 10 sites located throughout the USA were collected via the use of six SKC Biosamplers. Downwind aerosol samples from biosolids loading, unloading, land application and background operations were collected from all sites. All samples were analysed for the presence of HPC bacteria, total coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, coliphage, enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus and norovirus. Total coliforms, E. coli, C. perfringens and coliphage were not detected with great frequency from any sites, however, biosolids loading operations resulted in the largest concentrations of these aerosolized microbial indicators. Microbial risk analyses were conducted on loading and land application operations and their subsequent residential exposures determined. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest annual risks of infection occurred during loading operations, and resulted in a 4 x 10(-4) chance of infection from inhalation of coxsackievirus A21. Land application of biosolids resulted in risks that were <2 x 10(-4) from inhalation of coxsackievirus A21. Overall bioaerosol exposure from biosolids operations poses little community risk based on this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study evaluated the overall incidence of aerosolized micro-organisms from the land application of biosolids and subsequently determined that microbial risks of infection were low for residents close to biosolids application sites.
TI  - Effect of relative humidity on preharvest survival of bacterial and viral pathogens on the surface of cantaloupe, lettuce, and bell peppers.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of humidity on the preharvest survival of microbial pathogens on cantaloupe, lettuce, and bell peppers. An additional goal was to evaluate Clostridium perfringens as an indicator of fecal contamination on produce. The microorganisms used in this study included Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Clostridium perfringens, hepatitis A virus (HAV), feline calicivirus (FCV), and coliphage PRD1. The study took place in a controlled environment chamber that allowed for the control of temperature (18 to 26 degrees C) and relative humidity. Survival rates under high (mean, 85.7 to 90.3%) and low (mean, 45.1 to 48.4%) relative humidity were compared. The surfaces of the edible portion of each plant were inoculated with the study microorganisms. Samples were collected throughout 2 weeks. More microorganisms survived significantly longer (P < 0.05) on cantaloupe than on lettuce and bell peppers. The type of produce on which each organism experienced the highest inactivation rate tended to change with relative humidity. The survival of microorganisms on produce surfaces was not uniformly affected by relative humidity. Of the studied microorganisms, HAV, PRD1, and C. perfringens were found to have the lowest inactivation rates, whereas FCV and E. coli ATCC 25922 tended to become inactivated most rapidly. C. perfringens generally survived longer than all other bacteria and FCV in all experiments. This trend suggests that C. perfringens may be an acceptable indicator of bacterial contamination and survival in various environments and on different types of crops.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, Ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  - beta-Glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from Ruminococcus gnavus E1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-Glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp DNA fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from R. gnavus E1 was determined. Five ORFs were detected on this fragment: three complete ORFs (ORF2, gus and ORF3) and two partial ORFs (ORF4 and ORF5). The products of ORF2 and ORF3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), such as Escherichia coli BglC, Bacillus subtilis BglP and Bacillus halodurans PTS Enzyme II. The product of ORF5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of Clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bglA). The gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of Lactobacillus gasseri (69%), E. coli (61%), Clostridium perfringens (59%) and Staphylococcus aureus (58%). By complementing an E. coli strain in which the uidA gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the R. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. Moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes ORF2, ORF3 and ORF5.
TI  - [Fusion of betal-toxin gene and beta2-toxin gene from Clostridium perfringens type C].
AB  - Betal-toxin and beta2-toxin genes from chromosomal DNA of Clostridium perfringens type C were amplified by PCR, PCR products were cleaved with restriction endonucleases and recovered. The recombinant plasmid pETXB1-2 containing beta1-beta2 fusion genes was constructed by recombinant technique and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The beta1-beta2 fusion proteins were expressed in recombinant strain BL21 (DE3) (pETXB1-2), and the expression level of the beta1-beta2 fusion proteins was about 15.36% of total cellular protein by SDS-PAGE and thin-layer gel scanning analysis. More importantly, immunization in a mouse model with crude preparation containing the fusion protein inclusion bodies or inactivated recombinant strain induced protection against at least 1 MLD of the toxin from Clostridium perfringens type C. Hence the fusion proteins possess a good immunogenicity. The constructed recombinant strain BL21 (DE3) (pETXB1-2) can be used as a candidate of vaccine strain.
TI  - Protonated structures of naturally occurring deoxyribonucleic acids and their interaction with berberine.
AB  - Protonation-induced conformational changes in natural DNAs of diverse base composition under the influence of low pH, low temperature, and low ionic strength have been studied using various spectroscopic techniques. At pH3.40, 10mM [Na+], and at 5 degrees C, all natural DNAs irrespective of base composition adopted an unusual and stable conformation remarkably different from the canonical B-form conformation. This protonated conformation has been characterized to have unique absorption and circular dichroic spectral characteristics and exhibited cooperative thermal melting profiles with decreased thermal melting temperatures compared to their respective B-form counterparts. The nature of this protonated structure was further investigated by monitoring the interaction of the plant alkaloid, berberine that was previously shown from our laboratory to differentially bind to B-form and H(L)-form of poly[d(G-C)] [Bioorg. Med. Chem.2003, 11, 4861]. Binding of berberine to protonated conformation of natural DNAs resulted in intrinsic circular dichroic changes as well as generation of induced circular dichroic bands for the bound berberine molecule with opposite signs and magnitude compared with B-form structures. Nevertheless, the binding of the alkaloid to both the B and protonated forms was non-linear and non-cooperative as revealed from Scatchard plots derived from spectrophotometric titration data. Steady state fluorescence studies on the other hand showed remarkable increase of the rather weak intrinsic fluorescence of berberine on binding to the protonated structure compared to the B-form structure. Taken together, these results suggest that berberine can detect the formation of significant population of H(L)-form structures under the influence of protonation irrespective of heterogeneous base compositions in natural DNAs.
TI  - Potentiation of humoral immune responses to vaccine antigens by recombinant chicken IL-18 (rChIL-18).
AB  - Mammalian interleukin-18 (IL-18) is one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in innate immune responses to microbial infection preceding the induction of both cellular and humoral immune responses. We assessed the potential of Escherichia coli-expressed His-tag purified recombinant chicken IL-18 (rHis-ChIL-18) as a potentiator of vaccine-induced immune responses in 3 week-old SPF chickens and compared it with several commonly used traditional immunostimulating adjuvants. We found that rHis-ChIL-18 significantly enhanced antibody responses to Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxoid and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) antigens, comparable to the Al(OH)3-gel, Miglyol and chitosan adjuvant. However, antibody responses were lower than water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions and combinations of rHis-ChIL-18 with Al(OH)3-gel, Miglyol or chitosan. Improved HI-titers for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were not noted. We conclude that rHis-ChIL-18, when delivered in the proper context, is a novel and safe immunostimulator in chickens.
TI  - Development of multiplex PCR for the detection of total coliform bacteria for Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens in drinking water.
AB  - Multiplex PCR amplification of lacZ, uidA and plc genes was developed for the simultaneous detection of total coliform bacteria for Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, in drinking water. Detection by agarose gel electrophoresis yielded a band of 876 bp for the lacZ gene of all coliform bacteria; a band of 147 bp for the uidA gene and a band of 876 bp for the lacZ gene of all strains of E. coli; a band of 280 bp for the p/c gene for all strains of C. perfringens; and a negative result for all three genes when tested with other bacteria. The detection limit was 100 pg for E. coli and C. perfringens, and 1 ng for coliform bacteria when measured with purified DNA. This assay was applied to the detection of these bacteria in spiked water samples. Spiked water samples with 0-1,000 CFU/ml of coliform bacteria and/or E. coli and/or C. perfringens were detected by this multiplex PCR after a pre-enrichment step to increase the sensitivity and to ensure that the detection was based on the presence of cultivable bacteria. The result of bacterial detection from the multiplex PCR was comparable with that of a standard plate count on selective medium (p=0.62). When using standard plate counts as a gold standard, the sensitivity for this test was 99.1% (95% CI 95.33, 99.98) and the specificity was 90.9 % (95% CI 75.67, 98.08). Multiplex PCR amplification with a pre-enrichment step was shown to be an effective, sensitive and rapid method for the simultaneous detection of these three microbiological parameters in drinking water.
TI  - Detection of viral, bacterial, and parasitological RNA or DNA of nine intestinal  pathogens in fecal samples archived as part of the english infectious intestinal disease study: assessment of the stability of target nucleic acid.
AB  - Fecal samples were collected from cases and controls as part of the Infectious Intestinal Disease (IID) study in England and were stored as frozen suspensions for 8 to 12 years. The purpose of this study was to apply PCR-based procedures to assess the stability of pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences present in this archive. Samples from which Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Salmonella, Campylobacter, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC), enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, rotaviruses, noroviruses, or sapoviruses had been previously detected during the IID study using conventional methods were selected from the archive. A generic nucleic acid extraction method to recover RNA or DNA was used. Complementary DNA was generated from RNA by reverse transcription with random priming. Block-based and real-time PCR assays were used to amplify and detect gene fragments from each of these pathogens. The percentage reconfirmation of target was as follows: Giardia duodenalis 68%, Cryptosporidium 96%, Campylobacter 98%, Salmonella 98%, enterotoxigenic C perfringens 34%, EAggEC 93.3%, rotavirus 95%, norovirus 73%, and sapovirus 85%. This study has shown that nucleic acid can be extracted and specific sequences amplified and detected from archived fecal samples. The IID archive therefore represents a valuable resource for further studies, especially the investigation of the samples from which no pathogens had previously been detected.
TI  - Overexpression of a hydrogenase gene in Clostridium paraputrificum to enhance hydrogen gas production.
AB  - A [Fe]-hydrogenase gene (hydA) was cloned from Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 in Escherichia coli using a conserved DNA sequence of clostridial hydrogenase genes amplified by PCR as the probe. The hydA gene consisted of an open reading frame of 1749 bp encoding 582 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 64,560 Da. It was ligated into a shuttle vector, pJIR751, originally constructed for Clostridium perfringens and E. coli, and expressed in C. paraputrificum. Hydrogen gas productivity of the recombinant increased up to 1.7-fold compared with the wild-type. In the recombinant, overexpression of hydA abolished lactic acid production and increased acetic acid production by over-oxidation of NADH, which is required for reduction of pyruvic acid to lactic acid in the wild-type.
TI  - Microbial partitioning to settleable particles in stormwater.
AB  - The degree to which microbes in the water column associate with settleable particles has important implications for microbial transport in receiving waters, as well as for microbial removal via sedimentation (i.e. detention basins). The partitioning behavior of several bacterial, protozoan and viral indicator organisms is explored in three urban streams under both storm and dry weather conditions. The fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles in stormwater is estimated through use of a centrifugation technique which is calibrated using suspensions of standard particles (e.g., glass, latex). The fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles varies by type of microbe, and the partitioning behavior of each organism generally changes between dry weather and storm conditions. Bacterial indicator organisms (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci) exhibited relatively consistent behavior, with an average of 20-35% of organisms associated with these particles in background samples and 30-55% in storm samples. Clostridium perfringens spores exhibited the highest average level of particle association, with storm values varying from 50% to 70%. Results related to total coliphage partitioning were more variable, with 20-60% associated with particles during storms. These estimates should be valuable in surface water quality modeling efforts, many of which currently assume that all microbes exist as free (unattached) organisms.
TI  - Removal of micro-organisms in a small-scale hydroponics wastewater treatment system.
AB  - AIMS: To measure the microbial removal capacity of a small-scale hydroponics wastewater treatment plant. METHODS AND RESULTS: Paired samples were taken from untreated, partly-treated and treated wastewater and analysed for faecal microbial indicators, i.e. coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens spores and somatic coliphages, by culture based methods. Escherichia coli was never detected in effluent water after >5.8-log removal. Enterococci, coliforms, spores and coliphages were removed by 4.5, 4.1, 2.3 and 2.5 log respectively. Most of the removal (60-87%) took place in the latter part of the system because of settling, normal inactivation (retention time 12.7 d) and sand filtration. Time-dependent log-linear removal was shown for spores (k = -0.17 log d(-1), r(2) = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Hydroponics wastewater treatment removed micro-organisms satisfactorily. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Investigations on the microbial removal capacity of hydroponics have only been performed for bacterial indicators. In this study it has been shown that virus and (oo)cyst process indicators were removed and that hydroponics can be an alternative to conventional wastewater treatment.
TI  - Temperature effect on bacterial growth rate: quantitative microbiology approach including cardinal values and variability estimates to perform growth simulations on/in food.
AB  - Temperature effect on growth rates of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus, was studied. Growth rates were obtained in laboratory medium by using a binary dilutions method in which 15 optical density curves were generated to determine one mu value. The temperature was in the range from 2 to 48 degrees C, depending on the bacterial species. Data were analysed after a square root transformation. No large difference between the strains of a same species was observed, and therefore all the strains of a same species were analysed together with the same secondary model. The variability of the residual error, including both measurements errors and biological strain difference, was homogenous for sub-optimal temperature values. To represent this variability in bacterial kinetic simulation, the 95% confidence interval based on an asymptotic Normal distribution, around the growth rate value was determined. With this modelling approach, the behaviour of bacterial species on food, irrespective of the strain or the laboratory, was described. This growth simulation with confidence limits has several applications, such as to facilitate comparisons between a challenge-test and simulation results, and, to appreciate if the temperature change has or has not a significant effect on a bacterial growth profile, with regard to the uncontrolled factors. The integration of this piece of work in the Sym'Previus software is now in process. Results obtained in five French laboratories will be extended by working on new food and new microbial species and improved by further work on variability estimation.
TI  - One-year (2003) nationwide pork carcass microbiological baseline data survey in Taiwan.
AB  - From January through December 2003, swab samples from 1,650 pork carcasses were collected from 39 slaughter plants in Taiwan. These samples were analyzed for the prevalence of indicator microorganisms and specific pathogens. Viable aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli were recovered from 100, 95.3, and 87.5% of these carcasses, respectively. Of those carcasses that harbored bacteria, the mean aerobic plate, total coliform, and Escherichia coli counts were 4.0, 0.6, and 0.1 log CFU/cm2, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella were recovered from 4.8, 0.3, 13.8, 0.7, and 1.7 of 1,038 carcasses, respectively. E. coli O157:H7 was not detected from any carcass. When positive for a specific pathogen, the mean carcass concentration was 0.57 log CFU/cm2 for S. aureus, 0.66 most probable number (MPN)/cm2 for C. jejuni and C. coli, and 0.18 MPN/cm2 for Salmonella. The findings of this study will help provide a reference for establishing hygienic standards and a criterion for evaluating the effects of slaughtering operations in Taiwan.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of essential oils from Thai medicinal plants.
AB  - By using disc diffusion assay, the antimicrobial activity of 32 essential oil samples extracted from local plants or plants cultivated in Thailand was evaluated against zoonotic enteropathogens including Salmonella spp., Escherichai coli O157, Campylobacter jejunii and Clostridium perferingens which are important for broiler export. Out of the essential oil tested, only the essential oil of Zingiber cassumuna, Cinnamomum bejolghota, Mentha arvensis var. piperacens, Cymbopogon citratus and Ocimum basilicum var. citratum showed promising antibacterial activity against the bacteria tested.
TI  - Ligand binding properties of bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins.
AB  - Bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins share a common globin fold but differ  otherwise in structural and functional aspects. The bases of these differences were investigated through kinetic studies on oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide binding. The novel bacterial hemoglobins from Clostridium perfringens and Campylobacter jejuni and the flavohemoglobins from Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi have been analyzed. Examination of the biochemical and ligand binding properties of these proteins shows a clear distinction between the two groups. Flavohemoglobins show a much greater tendency to autoxidation compared to bacterial hemoglobins. The differences in affinity for oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide between bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins are mainly due to differences in the association rate constants. The second-order rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to bacterial hemoglobins are severalfold higher than those for flavohemoglobins. A similar trend is observed for NO association with the oxidized iron(III) form of the proteins. No major differences are observed among the values obtained for the dissociation rate constants for the two groups of bacterial proteins studied, and these constants are all rather similar to those for myoglobin. Taken together, our data suggest that differences exist between the mechanisms of ligand binding to bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins, suggesting different functions in the cell.
TI  - Selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in Tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, Tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin, menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of Clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. These two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli at 100 microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. Structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the C-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Myositis, lameness, and recumbency after use of water-in-oil adjuvanted vaccines  in near-term beef cattle.
AB  - A producer administered 2 US Department of Agriculture-licensed adjuvanted veterinary vaccines (inactivated bovine rotavirus-coronavirus vaccine; Clostridium perfringens type C-Escherichia coli bacterin-toxoid) into muscles of the left and right hips of 469 pregnant beef cows. Within 24 hours, 5 cattle were recumbent, and another 2 had non-weight bearing pelvic limb lameness (1.5% affected; 7/469). During the next 10 days, 50% of the herd developed firm swellings up to 24 cm in vaccination sites in muscles of the hip. Histological samples revealed granulomatous myositis with intralesional oil. Lesions resolved slowly during the next 6 months. Six cattle were injected experimentally with the vaccines. None became lame, but all developed foreign body granulomatous myositis similar to those in the affected herd. The maximum diameter of experimentally induced lesions in muscle at necropsy 60 days after injection with the recommended dose of the bacterin-toxoid vaccines was 12 cm. Histological examination revealed pyogranulomatous myositis, fibrosis, and myonecrosis. The inactivated viral vaccine induced milder granulomatous myositis with intralesional lipid and scant fibrosis. Acute transient lameness on the ranch was attributed to use of 2 irritating biological vaccines in the hip muscles of cows that were close to parturition.
TI  - Transcription activation of a UV-inducible Clostridium perfringens bacteriocin gene by a novel sigma factor.
AB  - Expression of the plasmid-encoded Clostridium perfringens gene for bacteriocin BCN5 was shown to depend in vivo and in vitro on the activity of UviA protein. UviA, also plasmid-encoded, proved to be an RNA polymerase sigma factor and was also partly autoregulatory. The uviA gene has two promoters; one provided a UviA-independent, basal level of gene expression while the stronger, UviA-dependent promoter was only utilized after the cell experienced DNA damage. As a result, BCN5 synthesis is induced by treatment with UV light or mitomycin C. UviA is related to a special class of sigma factors found to date only in Clostridium species and responsible for activating transcription of toxin genes in Clostridium difficile, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium botulinum.
TI  - Quorum sensing in Clostridium difficile: analysis of a luxS-type signalling system.
AB  - The increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease, and the problems associated with its control, highlight the need for additional countermeasures. The attenuation of virulence through the blockade of bacterial cell-to-cell communication (quorum sensing) is one potential therapeutic target. Preliminary studies have shown that C. difficile produces at least one potential signalling molecule. Through the molecule's ability to induce bioluminescence in a Vibrio harveyi luxS reporter strain, it has been shown to correspond to autoinducer 2 (AI-2). In keeping with this observation, a homologue of luxS has been identified in the genome of C. difficile. Adjacent to luxS(Cd) a potential transcriptional regulator and sensor kinase, rolA and rolB, have been located. RT-PCR has been used to confirm the genetic organization of the luxS(Cd) locus. While AI-2 production has not been blocked so far using antisense technology, AI-2 levels could be modulated by controlling expression of the putative transcriptional regulator rolA. RolA, therefore, acts as a negative regulator of AI-2 production. Finally, it has been shown that the exogenous addition of AI-2 or 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H) furanone has no discernible effect on the production of toxins by C. difficile.
TI  - Discrimination efficacy of fecal pollution detection in different aquatic habitats of a high-altitude tropical country, using presumptive coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens spores.
AB  - The performance of rapid and practicable techniques that presumptively identify total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens spores (CP) by testing them on a pollution gradient in differing aquatic habitats in a high-altitude tropical country was evaluated during a 12-month period. Site selection was based on high and low anthropogenic influence criteria of paired sites including six spring, six stream, and four lakeshore sites spread over central and eastern parts of Uganda. Unlike the chemophysical water quality, which was water source type dependent (i.e., spring, lake, or stream), fecal indicators were associated with the anthropogenic influence status of the respective sites. A total of 79% of the total variability, including all the determined four bacteriological and five chemophysical parameters, could be assigned to either a pollution, a habitat, or a metabolic activity component by principal-component analysis. Bacteriological indicators revealed significant correlations to the pollution component, reflecting that anthropogenic contamination gradients were followed. Discrimination sensitivity analysis revealed high ability of E. coli to differentiate between high and low levels of anthropogenic influence. CP also showed a reasonable level of discrimination, although FC and TC were found to have worse discrimination efficacy. Nonpoint influence by soil erosion could not be detected during the study period by correlation analysis, although a theoretical contamination potential existed, as investigated soils in the immediate surroundings often contained relevant concentrations of fecal indicators. The outcome of this study indicates that rapid techniques for presumptive E. coli and CP determination may be reliable for fecal pollution monitoring in high-altitude tropical developing countries such as those of Eastern Africa.
TI  - Application of molecular genetic methods in diagnostics and epidemiology of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter and Yersinia species, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens are the bacterial pathogens constituting the greatest burden of food-borne disease in Finland. Several molecular genetic methods have been applied to diagnose, discriminate and survey these bacteria. PCR, PCR-RFLP and PFGE are the most widely and successfully used. However, these methods are unable to replace conventional and internationally standardised phenotyping. Electronic database libraries of the different genomic profiles will enable continuous surveillance of infections and detection of possible infection clusters at an early stage. Furthermore, whole-genome sequence data have opened up new insights into epidemiological surveillance. Laboratory-based surveillance performed in a timely manner and exploiting adequate methods, and co-operation at local, national and international levels are among the key elements in preventing food-borne diseases. This paper reviews different applications of molecular genetic methods for investigating enteric bacterial pathogens and gives examples of the methods successfully used in diagnostics and epidemiological studies in Finland.
TI  - A clostridial endo-beta-galactosidase that cleaves both blood group A and B glycotopes: the first member of a new glycoside hydrolase family, GH98.
AB  - We have isolated an endo-beta-galactosidase designated E-ABase from Clostridium perfringens ATCC 10543 capable of liberating both the A trisaccharide (A-Tri; GalNAcalpha1-->3(Fucalpha1-->2)Gal) and B trisaccharide (B-Tri; Galalpha1-->3(Fucalpha1-->2)Gal) from glycoconjugates containing blood group A and B glycotopes, respectively. We have subsequently cloned the gene (eabC) that encodes E-ABase from this organism. This gene was found to be identical to the CPE0329 gene of C. perfringens strain 13, whose product was labeled as a hypothetical protein (Shimizu, T., Ohtani, K., Hirakawa, H., Ohshima, K., Yamashita, A., Shiba, T., Ogasawara, N., Hattori, M., Kuhara, S., and Hayashi, H. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 996-1001). Since the amino acid sequence of E-ABase does not bear detectable similarity to any of the 97 existing families of glycoside hydrolases, we have proposed to assign this unusual enzyme to a new family, GH98. We also expressed eabC in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and obtained 27 mg of fully active recombinant E-ABase from 1 liter of culture. Recombinant E-ABase not only destroyed the blood group A and B antigenicity of human type A and B erythrocytes, but also released A-Tri and B-Tri from blood group A(+)- and B(+)- containing glycoconjugates. The structures of A-Tri and B-Tri liberated from A(+) porcine gastric mucin and B(+) human ovarian cyst glycoprotein were established by NMR spectroscopy. The unique specificity of E-ABase should make it useful for studying the structure and function of blood group A- and B-containing glycoconju-gates as well as for identifying other glycosidases belonging to the new GH98 family.
TI  - Evaluation of immunosuppressants and dietary mechanisms in an experimental disease model for necrotic enteritis.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens (CP) is the etiologic agent of necrotic enteritis (NE). Clinical signs of this disease include depression, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and severe necrosis of the intestinal tract. Understanding the disease progression of NE has been difficult due to its complexity and the involvement of multiple factors (dietary components, immunosuppression, and mechanical irritation of the gut) that appear to contribute to this syndrome. In the present investigation, day-of-hatch broilers were fed a 55% wheat diet and randomly assigned to 1 of 8 groups. Treatments included positive control (CP challenge only), commercial coccidia vaccine (CCV), commercial bursal disease vaccine (CBDV), or the combination of CCV and CBDV, and an appropriate negative control for each (vaccinated and not challenged). Challenged treatment groups received 10(7) cfu of CP twice daily. When compared with controls, broilers in each treatment group had increased (P < or = 0.05) lesion scores, with mean scores of 1.05 and 2.05 in the CP and CBDV + CP treatments, respectively. When compared with controls, the incidence of CP increased (P < or = 0.05) in all treatment groups (73 and 100% in the CCV + CP and CBDV + CP treatment groups, respectively). Compared with controls, percentage mortality increased (P < or = 0.05) from 2% to 26 and 34% in the CP and CBDV + CP treatment groups, respectively. Results of this study indicate that the methodology used provides a good model for studying NE.
TI  - A retrospective study of mortality in Pennsylvania captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus): 20000--2003.
AB  - The postmortem records of 160 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) submitted for necropsy examination from 59 separate Pennsylvania captive deer farms over a 3.5-year period were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. The most common causes of death were bronchopneumonia (39 cases), enterocolitis (30 cases), malnutrition (13 cases), and trauma (11 cases). Other causes of mortality included severe gastrointestinal parasitism (6 cases), cellulitis with septicemia (5 cases), degenerative myopathy (4 cases), ruminal acidosis (4 cases), and nephritis (4 cases). The cause of death was undetermined in 13 of the 160 animals. Arcanobacterium pyogenes (19 cases), Fusobacterium necrophorum (10 cases), Escherichia coli (7 cases), and Mannheimia haemolytica (4 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the pneumonic lungs. Bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included Clostridium perfringens (15 cases), E. coli (12 cases), and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (2 cases). The majority (52.2%) of the death loss in white-tailed deer of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 46.2% of the bronchopneumonia cases and 50.0% of the enterocolitis cases occurring during this time period. Cases of degenerative myopathy, myocardial degeneration, hepatic necrosis, meningoencephalitis, peritonitis, and urolithiasis considered severe enough to be the primary cause of death appeared early in life, affecting deer 6 months of age or less in all cases. In conclusion, bronchopneumonia, enterocolitis, malnutrition, and trauma were considered the most common causes of death in confined white-tailed deer in this study.
TI  - Occurrence of microbial indicators and Clostridium perfringens in wastewater, water column samples, sediments, drinking water, and Weddell seal feces collected at McMurdo Station, Antarctica.
AB  - McMurdo Station, Antarctica, has discharged untreated sewage into McMurdo Sound for decades. Previous studies delineated the impacted area, which included the drinking water intake, by using total coliform and Clostridium perfringens concentrations. The estimation of risk to humans in contact with the impacted and potable waters may be greater than presumed, as these microbial indicators may not be the most appropriate for this environment. To address these concerns, concentrations of these and additional indicators (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, coliphage, and enteroviruses) in the untreated wastewater, water column, and sediments of the impacted area and drinking water treatment facility and distribution system at McMurdo Station were determined. Fecal samples from Weddell seals in this area were also collected and analyzed for indicators. All drinking water samples were negative for indicators except for a single total coliform-positive sample. Total coliforms were present in water column samples at higher concentrations than other indicators. Fecal coliform and enterococcus concentrations were similar to each other and greater than those of other indicators in sediment samples closer to the discharge site. C. perfringens concentrations were higher in sediments at greater distances from the discharge site. Seal fecal samples contained concentrations of fecal coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, and C. perfringens similar to those found in untreated sewage. All samples were negative for enteroviruses. A wastewater treatment facility at McMurdo Station has started operation, and these data provide a baseline data set for monitoring the recovery of the impacted area. The contribution of seal feces to indicator concentrations in this area should be considered.
TI  - Crystallization and atomic resolution X-ray diffraction of the catalytic domain of the large sialidase, nanI, from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Sialidases catalyse the removal of terminal sialic acids from a range of glycoproteins, glycolipids and oligosaccharides. They have been found in bacteria, viruses and parasites, where they play important roles in pathogenesis and/or microbial nutrition, and in mammalian cells, where they modulate cell-surface glycosylation associated with a range of cellular activities. Clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of gas gangrene and peritonitis in humans, possesses three sialidases: nanH, nanI and nanJ, with molecular weights of 42, 77 and 129 kDa, respectively. The two larger enzymes are secreted by the bacterium and are involved in the pathogenesis and nutrition of Clostridium. As part of a study to examine the structures of all three enzymes, crystallization of the 77 kDa nanI isoenzyme was attempted. The expressed full-length protein was found to degrade easily; a stable 50 kDa catalytic domain was therefore subcloned. This domain was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and produced crystals belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 96.98, b = 69.41, c = 72.69 A and one monomer per asymmetric unit. The crystals diffract to at least 0.92 A. A molecular-replacement solution was obtained using the catalytic domain of the sialidase from the leech Macrobdella decora.
TI  - Waterfowl and the bacteriological quality of amenity ponds.
AB  - This study investigated the impact of waterfowl on the bacteriological quality of village ponds in East Yorkshire, north-east England. Water and sediment samples were collected from ponds with and without resident ducks and geese; faecal indicator and potentially pathogenic bacteria were assayed by membrane filtration and by selective enrichment. Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and, to a degree, Clostridium perfringens were more abundant in ponds with waterfowl; Salmonella was isolated in June-August from the sediment of a pond with waterfowl. The results suggested that the bacteriological quality of village ponds might be adversely affected by waterfowl. All water samples from ponds with waterfowl had faecal indicators at higher concentrations than EU requirements for bathing waters. Although these ponds are not bathing waters we suggest skin contact and accidental ingestion of water should be avoided.
TI  - Eradication of pathogenic bacteria and restoration of normal pouch flora: comparison of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of pouchitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are commonly used for treatment; however, nothing is known about the effects on the pouch flora during and after pouchitis episodes. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of both antibiotics on eradication of pathogens and the restoration of normal pouch flora. METHODS: The fecal flora obtained from 13 patients with ulcerative colitis was examined at the beginning of a pouchitis episode before treatment, during treatment with metronidazole or ciprofloxacin, and during pouchitis-free periods. Some patients experienced more than one pouchitis episode. Therefore, a total of 104 samples was obtained. Each sample was cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and the isolated bacteria were identified. Furthermore, the clinical response to both antibiotics was compared using the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index score. RESULTS: During pouchitis-free periods, the patients had a flora characterized by high numbers of anaerobes and no or low numbers of pathogens. This flora resembles normal colon flora. During pouchitis episodes, we found a significant decrease of anaerobes ( P = 0.01), a significant increase of aerobic bacteria ( P = 0.01), and significantly more numbers of pathogens, such as Clostridium perfringens (in 95 percent of the samples; P < 0.01) and hemolytic strains of Escherichia coli (in 57 percent of the samples; P = 0.05). Treatment with metronidazole resulted in a complete eradication of the anaerobic flora, including C. perfringens. However, no changes in the numbers of E. coli were found. In contrast, when the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin, not only C. perfringens, but also all coliforms including hemolytic strains of E. coli disappeared. The larger part of the anaerobic flora was left undisturbed during the administration of ciprofloxacin. Patients treated with ciprofloxacin experienced significant larger reductions in Pouchitis Disease Activity Index score compared with patients treated with metronidazole ( P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study strongly suggests a role of pathogenic bacteria ( C. perfringens and/or hemolytic strains of E. coli) in pouchitis. From a microbiologic and a clinical point of view, ciprofloxacin is preferable to metronidazole, because treatment with ciprofloxacin eradicates both pathogens and results in an optimal restoration of normal pouch flora.
TI  - Molecular inventory of faecal microflora in patients with Crohn's disease.
AB  - Intestinal microbial community is involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, but knowledge of its potential abnormalities has been limited by the impossibility to grow many dominant intestinal bacteria. Using sequence analysis of randomly cloned bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA, the dominant faecal species from four Crohn's disease patients and four controls were compared. Whereas marked inter-individual differences were observed in the faecal microflora of patients, three remained distantly related to controls on the basis of their operational taxonomic unit composition. Bacteroides vulgatus and closely related organisms represented the only molecular species shared by all patients and exhibited an unusually high rate of occurrence. Escherichia coli clones were isolated only in two patients with ileocolonic Crohn's disease. Moreover, numerous clones belonged to phylogenetic groups or species that are commonly not dominant in the faecal microflora of healthy subjects: Pectinatus, Sutterella, Verrucomicrobium, Fusobacterium, Clostridium disporicum, Clostridium glycolicum, Clostridium ramosum, Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - The effect of container-biofilm on the microbiological quality of water used from plastic household containers.
AB  - Studies in Southern Africa have shown that even when microbiologically safe water is supplied to developing communities at communal standpipes, contamination by high numbers of pathogenic microorganisms may occur during the processes of fetching water from the supply source and storage during use at home, rendering such waters unsafe for human consumption. This study investigated the occurrence of biofilm in PVC storage containers as one possible reason for this deterioration, using heterotrophic bacteria and total coliform counts as well as turbidity as indicators. A second objective was to determine whether biofilm in water-storage containers could contribute to hazardous microbiological contamination indicated by Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. Results indicated that increased microbiological contamination is associated with biofilm. The biofilm harbours heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms and C. perfringens. E. coli could not be associated directly with the levels of biofilm in containers but rather appears to be introduced intermittently from the ambient domestic environment. When dislodged with the biofilm, these bacteria contributed substantially to the deterioration of the microbiological quality of supplied water stored in plastic containers.
TI  - CdeA of Clostridium difficile, a new multidrug efflux transporter of the MATE family.
AB  - The cdeA gene, cloned from Clostridium difficile clinical strain 714 under the control of its natural promoter made Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens resistant to ethidium bromide and acriflavin but had no effect on the susceptibility of the hosts to the following antibiotics: norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracyclin, and chloramphenicol. However, it was responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli when it was cloned under the control of the Plac promoter. Quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR showed that growth of C. difficile clinical strain 253 in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ethidium bromide significantly increased the transcription of cdeA, but this was not observed with ciprofloxacin. The deduced protein was homologous to the protein sequences of known efflux pumps from the third cluster (the so-called DinF branch) of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. CdeA caused ethidium bromide energy-dependent efflux in whole cells of E. coli. Efflux activity was stimulated by addition of Na+ ions, suggesting that CdeA, like other pumps of the MATE family, is a Na+-coupled efflux pump. CdeA is the first multidrug efflux transporter identified in C. difficile.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Glycopeptide derived from hen egg ovomucin has the ability to bind enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Ovomucin glycopeptide (OGP) was prepared by size exclusion chromatography after Pronase digestion of hen egg ovomucin, and the binding of OGP to foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus,Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was investigaed. Binding assays with biotinylated bacteria as probes in microtiter plates showed that OGP bound to only E. coli O157:H7 among these foodborne pathogens. Periodate treatment markedly reduced the binding ability, indicating that E. coli O157:H7 bound to carbohydrate moieties of OGP. Lectin blot analysis with Maackia amurensis (MAA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA), which are specific for oligosaccharides containing sialic acid, revealed their binding sites in OGP were similar to the E. coli O157:H7 binding sites that were probed with biotinylated E. coli O157:H7 after Western blotting of OGP. Sialydase treatment of OGP abolished its ability to bind E. coli O157:H7, demonstrating that sialic acid played an important role in the binding. These results suggest that OGP has E. coli O157:H7-specific binding sites that consist of sialic acid. On the basis of these properties, OGP has the potential to be an ingredient with a protective effect against E. coli O157:H7 infection and to be a novel probe for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in the food hygiene field.
TI  - Cot mattresses as reservoirs of potentially harmful bacteria and the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Cot mattress materials were investigated as potential reservoirs of bacteria in relation to the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The sleeping position of the infant significantly influenced bacterial population density of cot mattress polyurethane foams (p<0.0000001) and their covers (p<0.004). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated at significantly higher frequency (p<0.03) from the infant's head region of cot mattress materials. Significantly higher bacterial population densities (p<0.001) were associated with polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses (exposed polyurethane foam), when compared to those from mattresses completely covered by polyvinyl chloride (integral type mattress). The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses was also significantly higher (p=0.03) than from foams from the integral type. The following factors were significantly associated with increased frequency of isolation of S. aureus: from the polyurethane foam, previous use of non-integral mattresses by another child (p=0.03 for all sample sites, p=0.01 for torso region); from the covers, sleeping in the prone position (p=0.003 head region, p=0.001 torso region). Prone sleeping was also significantly associated with increased bacterial population levels (p=0.01) and increased frequency of isolation of Escherichia coli (p=0.02) from the torso region of cot mattress covers. These findings could explain some recently identified risk factors for SIDS associated with type and previous use of cot mattresses. Clostridium perfringens was isolated at very low frequency and Streptococcus pyogenes was not isolated from any cot mattress materials tested.
TI  - Evaluation of the purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification devices.
AB  - A test was performed to evaluate the microbial and chemical purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification filter devices with production capacity less than 100 L/h. The devices were tested for simultaneous removal capacity of bacteria (cultured Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae), enteric protozoans (formalin-stored Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts), viral markers (F-RNA bacteriophages) and microcystins produced by toxic cyanobacterial cultures. In general, the devices tested were able to remove bacterial contaminants by 3.6-6.9 log10 units from raw water. Those devices based only on filtration through pores 0.2-0.4 microm or larger failed in viral and chemical purification. Only one device, based on reverse osmosis, was capable of removing F-RNA phages at concentrations under the detection limit and microcystins by 2.5 log10. The present study emphasised the need for evaluation tests of water purification devices from the public safety and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) points of view. Simultaneous testing for various pathogenic/indicator microbes and microcystins was shown to be a useful and practical way to obtain essential data on actual purification capacity of commercial small-scale drinking-water filters.
TI  - Inactivation of enteric microbes in water by electro-chemical oxidant from brine  (NaCl) and free chlorine.
AB  - Oxidant solutions of mostly free chlorine can be electrochemically produced on-site from brine (NaCl) solution and used to disinfect water at the household or community level. In this study electrochemical oxidant (ECO) from brine and free chlorine were evaluated under laboratory conditions for inactivation of test microbes. Purified suspensions of Escherichia coli, the rugose strain of Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium perfringens spores, MS2 coliphage and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were treated with 2 mg/L or 5 mg/L solutions of ECO or free chlorine at 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C and pH 6, 8, and 10 (pH 7 and 25 degrees C only for C. parvum oocysts) for contact times <60 min. Under nearly all conditions, inactivation kinetics were more rapid for E. coli, V. cholerae, C. perfringens spores and MS2 coliphage with ECO than with free chlorine. ECO reduced E. coli, V. cholerae and MS2 by >4 log10 within 30 min and C. perfringens spores by >2 log10 within 10 min at pH 8 and 25 degrees C. Contrary to previous results, however, C. parvum oocysts were not inactivated by ECO, and the reasons for this difference are uncertain. The on-site electrolytic generation of oxidants from brine provided a convenient and inexpensive disinfectant containing free chlorine that was effective against many enteric microbes, for the treatment of household and community drinking-water supplies worldwide. However, the effectiveness of such oxidants for inactivating C. parvum oocysts was variable and sometimes ineffective.
TI  - Genome architecture studied by nanoscale imaging: analyses among bacterial phyla  and their implication to eukaryotic genome folding.
AB  - The proper function of the genome largely depends on the higher order architecture of the chromosome. Our previous application of nanotechnology to the questions regarding the structural basis for such macromolecular dynamics has shown that the higher order architecture of the Escherichia coli genome (nucleoid) is achieved via several steps of DNA folding (Kim et al., 2004). In this study, the hierarchy of genome organization was compared among E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. A one-molecule-imaging technique, atomic force microscopy (AFM), was applied to the E. coli cells on a cover glass that were successively treated with a detergent, and demonstrated that the nucleoids consist of a fundamental fibrous structure with a diameter of 80 nm that was further dissected into a 40-nm fiber. An application of this on-substrate procedure to the S. aureus and the C. perfringens nucleoids revealed that they also possessed the 40- and 80-nm fibers that were sustainable in the mild detergent solution. The E. coli nucleoid dynamically changed its structure during cell growth; the 80-nm fibers releasable from the cell could be transformed into a tightly packed state depending upon the expression of Dps. However, the S. aureus and the C. perfringens nucleoids never underwent such tight compaction when they reached stationary phase. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that this was possibly due to the lack of a nucleoid protein, Dps, in both species. AFM analysis revealed that both the mitotic chromosome and the interphase chromatin of human cells were also composed of 80-nm fibers. Taking all together, we propose a structural model of the bacterial nucleoid in which a fundamental mechanism of chromosome packing is common in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
TI  - The CcpA protein is necessary for efficient sporulation and enterotoxin gene (cpe) regulation in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is the cause of several human diseases, including gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), enteritis necroticans, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and acute food poisoning. The symptoms of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and acute food poisoning are due to sporulation-dependent production of C. perfringens enterotoxin encoded by the cpe gene. Glucose is a catabolite repressor of sporulation by C. perfringens. In order to identify the mechanism of catabolite repression by glucose, a mutation was introduced into the ccpA gene of C. perfringens by conjugational transfer of a nonreplicating plasmid into C. perfringens, which led to inactivation of the ccpA gene by homologous recombination. CcpA is a transcriptional regulator known to mediate catabolite repression in a number of low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria, of which C. perfringens is a member. The ccpA mutant strain sporulated at a 60-fold lower efficiency than the wild-type strain in the absence of glucose. In the presence of 5 mM glucose, sporulation was repressed about 2,000-fold in the wild-type strain and 800-fold in the ccpA mutant strain compared to sporulation levels for the same strains grown in the absence of glucose. Therefore, while CcpA is necessary for efficient sporulation in C. perfringens, glucose-mediated catabolite repression of sporulation is not due to the activity of CcpA. Transcription of the cpe gene was measured in the wild-type and ccpA mutant strains grown in sporulation medium by using a cpe-gusA fusion (gusA is an Escherichia coli gene encoding the enzyme beta-glucuronidase). In the exponential growth phase, cpe transcription was two times higher in the ccpA mutant strain than in the wild-type strain. Transcription of cpe was highly induced during the entry into stationary phase in wild-type cells but was not induced in the ccpA mutant strain. Glucose repressed cpe transcription in both the wild-type and ccpA mutant strain. Therefore, CcpA appears to act as a repressor of cpe transcription in exponential growth but is required for efficient sporulation and cpe transcription upon entry into stationary phase. CcpA was also required for maximum synthesis of collagenase (kappa toxin) and acted as a repressor of polysaccharide capsule synthesis in the presence of glucose, but it did not regulate synthesis of the phospholipase PLC (alpha toxin).
TI  - Effects of dietary mannan oligosaccharide, bacitracin methylene disalicylate, or  both on the live performance and intestinal microbiology of turkeys.
AB  - Hybrid male turkeys were fed to 18 wk of age in a completely randomized design with 10 replicate pens (18 birds each) per treatment to compare growth promoters. Four dietary treatments were used: negative control (CON), bacitracin methylene disalicyate (BMD) at 55 mg/kg to 6 wk and 27.5 mg/kg thereafter, mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) at 0.1% to 6 wk and 0.05% thereafter, and BMD and MOS at concentrations listed above. There were 3 toms/m2 (3.59 ft2/tom) on fresh pine shavings inoculated with used litter. A 6-phase feeding program was used, with crumbles the first 3 wk and pellets thereafter. At wk 6 and 18, one bird per pen was killed, and the large intestinal microbial populations, after being frozen, were enumerated (i.e., bifidobacteria, Clostridium perfringens, coliforms, enterococci, Escherichia coli, lactobacilli, and total anerobes). Body weights at wk 18 were as follows: CON, 11.87 kg; BMD, 12.46 kg; MOS: 12.56 kg; and BMD + MOS, 12.79 kg. The BMD and MOS turkeys were (P < 0.05) heavier than CON birds, and those fed the combination were significantly heavier than all other treatments. At wk 18, BMD + MOS feed conversion ratio of 2.66 was significantly lower than CON at 3.00 with BMD and MOS being intermediate (2.83 and 2.79, respectively). Mortality was not affected by treatment. The BMD and MOS each reduced large intestinal concentrations of Clostridium perfringens (log transformed data analysis) at wk 6 but not at wk 18. The BMD or MOS each improved turkey performance, and when used together, exhibited further beneficial effects.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus has a novel structure.
AB  - In Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, oxaloacetate synthesis is a major and  essential CO(2)-fixation reaction. This methanogenic archaeon possesses two oxaloacetate-synthesizing enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from this organism was purified to homogeneity. The subunit size of this homotetrameric protein was 55 kDa, which is about half that of all known bacterial and eukaryotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (PPCs). The NH(2)-terminal sequence identified this enzyme as the product of MTH943, an open reading frame with no assigned function in the genome sequence. A BLAST search did not show an obvious sequence similarity between MTH943 and known PPCs, which are generally well conserved. This is the first report of a new type of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase that we call PpcA ("A" for "archaeal"). Homologs to PpcA were present in most archaeal genomic sequences, but only in three bacterial (Clostridium perfringens, Oenococcus oeni, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) and no eukaryotic genomes. PpcA was the only recognizable oxaloacetate-producing enzyme in Methanopyrus kandleri, a hydrothermal vent organism. Each PpcA-containing organism lacked a PPC homolog. The activity of M. thermautotrophicus PpcA was not influenced by acetyl coenzyme A and was about 50 times less sensitive to aspartate than the Escherichia coli PPC. The catalytic core (including His(138), Arg(587), and Gly(883)) of the E. coli PPC was partly conserved in PpcA, but three of four aspartate-binding residues (Lys(773), Arg(832), and Asn(881)) were not. PPCs probably evolved from PpcA through a process that added allosteric sites to the enzyme. The reverse is also equally possible.
TI  - Monitoring marine recreational water quality using multiple microbial indicators  in an urban tropical environment.
AB  - The microbial water quality at two beaches, Hobie Beach and Crandon Beach, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA was measured using multiple microbial indicators for the purpose of evaluating correlations between microbes and for identifying possible sources of contamination. The indicator microbes chosen for this study (enterococci, Escherichia coli, fecal coliform, total coliform and C. perfringens) were evaluated through three different sampling efforts. These efforts included daily measurements at four locations during a wet season month and a dry season month, spatially intensive water sampling during low- and high-tide periods, and a sand sampling effort. Results indicated that concentrations did not vary in a consistent fashion between one indicator microbe and another. Daily water quality frequently exceeded guideline levels at Hobie Beach for all indicator microbes except for fecal coliform, which never exceeded the guideline. Except for total coliform, the concentrations of microbes did not change significantly between seasons in spite of the fact that the physical-chemical parameters (rainfall, temperature, pH, and salinity) changed significantly between the two monitoring periods. Spatially intense water sampling showed that the concentrations of microbes were significantly different with distance from the shoreline. The highest concentrations were observed at shoreline points and decreased at offshore points. Furthermore, the highest concentrations of indicator microbe concentrations were observed at high tide, when the wash zone area of the beach was submerged. Beach sands within the wash zone tested positive for all indicator microbes, thereby suggesting that this zone may serve as the source of indicator microbes. Ultimate sources of indicator microbes to this zone may include humans, animals, and possibly the survival and regrowth of indicator microbes due to the unique environmental conditions found within this zone. Overall, the results of this study indicated that the concentrations of indicator microbes do not necessarily correlate with one another. Exceedence of water quality guidelines, and thus the frequency of beach advisories, depends upon which indicator microbe is chosen.
TI  - Growth responses of Cassia obtusifolia toward human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1,2-Dihydroxyanthraquinone (1) was isolated from the seed of Cassia obtusifolia through bioassay-guided fractionation. 1,2-Dihydroxyanthraquinone strongly inhibited the growth of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli. Structure-activity relationship revealed that 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone (2) and 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (3) had strong growth-inhibition against C. perfringens. In growth-promoting activity, 1,2-, 1,4-, and 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones exhibited strong growth-promoting activity to Bifidobacterium bifidum.
TI  - Membrane-dependent conformational changes initiate cholesterol-dependent cytolysin oligomerization and intersubunit beta-strand alignment.
AB  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins are bacterial protein toxins that bind to cholesterol-containing membranes, form oligomeric complexes and insert into the bilayer to create large aqueous pores. Membrane-dependent structural rearrangements required to initiate the oligomerization of perfringolysin O monomers have been identified, as have the monomer-monomer interaction surfaces, using site-specific mutagenesis, disulfide trapping and multiple fluorescence techniques. Upon binding to the membrane, a structural element in perfringolysin O moves to expose the edge of a previously hidden beta-strand that forms the monomer-monomer interface and is required for oligomer assembly. The beta-strands that form the interface each contain a single aromatic residue, and these aromatics appear to stack, thereby aligning the transmembrane beta-hairpins of adjacent monomers in the proper register for insertion. Collectively, these data reveal a novel membrane binding-dependent mechanism for regulating cytolysin monomer-monomer association and pore formation.
TI  - Comparative analysis of Cryptosporidium, Giardia and indicator bacteria during sewage sludge hygienization in various composting processes.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the suitability of Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and enterococci as indicator organisms for Cryptosporidium and Giardia in treated sludge. METHODS AND RESULTS: Occurrence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts, detected and enumerated by direct immunofluorescence microscopy, were compared with counts of indicator bacteria during six different sewage sludge hygienization processes, including closed reactor and open windrow composting, and sludge sanitation by quicklime or peat addition. No statistical correlation existed between the counts of indicator bacteria, Cl. perfringens, E. coli, and enterococci and occurrence of Cryptosporidium or Giardia. In sludge end-products, Giardia cysts were detected more frequently than Cryptosporidium oocysts. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Direct analysis is the best method to confirm the presence of (oo)cysts in sludge.
TI  - Effect of epsilon toxin-GFP on MDCK cells and renal tubules in vivo.
AB  - Epsilon toxin (epsilon-toxin), produced by Clostridium perfringens types B and D, causes fatal enterotoxemia, also known as pulpy kidney disease, in livestock. Recombinant epsilon-toxin-green fluorescence protein (epsilon-toxin-GFP) and epsilon-prototoxin-GFP were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. MTT assays on MDCK cells confirmed that recombinant epsilon-toxin-GFP retained the cytotoxicity of the native toxin. Direct fluorescence analysis of MDCK cells revealed a homogeneous peripheral pattern that was temperature sensitive and susceptible to detergent. epsilon-Toxin-GFP and epsilon-prototoxin-GFP bound to endothelia in various organs of injected mice, especially the brain. However, fluorescence mainly accumulated in kidneys. Mice injected with epsilon-toxin-GFP showed severe kidney alterations, including hemorrhagic medullae and selective degeneration of distal tubules. Moreover, experiments on kidney cryoslices demonstrated specific binding to distal tubule cells of a range of species. We demonstrate with new recombinant fluorescence tools that epsilon-toxin binds in vivo to endothelial cells and renal tubules, where it has a strong cytotoxic effect. Our binding experiments indicate that an epsilon-toxin receptor is expressed on renal distal tubules of mammalian species, including human.
TI  - Blinded application of microscopy, bacteriological culture, immunoassays and PCR  to detect gastrointestinal pathogens from faecal samples of patients with community-acquired diarrhoea.
AB  - A blinded trial in two different laboratories was performed to compare the detection of selected enteric pathogens in 92 unselected faecal samples collected from patients with community-acquired diarrhoea by conventional and PCR-based techniques. Conventional techniques detected a single potential etiological agent in 15% of the samples, whereas results of PCR detected evidence of at least one agent in 41% of the samples. Overall, the detection rates for the different pathogens were as follows: adenovirus serogroup F, 1%; Campylobacter spp., 7.6%; Salmonella spp., 4%; enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, 9.8%; enteropathogenic E. coli, 6.5%; enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 3%; Cryptosporidium spp., 13%; and Giardia spp., 11%. Results for the detection of Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and C. perfringens were similar by both techniques, whereas Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. were detected 22 times more often by PCR than by conventional microscopy. It was not possible to compare the results for detection of enteroaggregative E. coli and enteropathogenic E. coli since these were only investigated by PCR. The results of this small study clearly demonstrate the advantages of PCR-based methods compared to conventional techniques for the detection of gastrointestinal pathogens.
TI  - [Search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  - For the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. As revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are B. longum, B. adolescentis and B. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus. In 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens have been tested. B. longum strain 58B, B. infantis strain 37B, L. rhamnosus strain 12L and L. acidophilus strain 27L, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. These strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
TI  - Oxidative stress response in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens, a strictly anaerobic bacterium, is able to survive when  exposed to oxygen for short periods of time and exhibits a complex adaptive response to reactive oxygen species, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, this adaptive response is not completely understood. C. perfringens possesses specialized genes that might be involved in this adaptive process, such as those encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD), superoxide reductase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, but their contribution to the oxidative stress response and their control mechanisms are unknown. By a combination of functional complementation of Escherichia coli strains impaired in either SOD, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) or catalase activity (Cat), transcription analysis and characterization of mutants impaired in regulatory genes, it was concluded that: (i) the product of the sod gene is certainly essential to scavenge superoxide radicals, (ii) the ahpC gene, which is fully induced in all oxidative stress conditions, is probably involved in the scavenging of all intracellular peroxides, (iii) the three rubrerythrin (rbr) genes of C. perfringens do not encode proteins with in vivo H(2)O(2) reductase activity, and (iv) the two rubredoxin (rub) genes do not contribute to the hypothetical superoxide reductase activity, but are likely to belong to an electron transfer chain involved in energy metabolism.
TI  - High-level expression of clostridial sialidase using a ferredoxin gene promoter-based plasmid.
AB  - A "large" sialidase isozyme (NanI) from Clostridium perfringens is a representative microbial sialidase with broad substrate specificity, being used for the analysis of sialoglycoconjugates. It is also a possible virulence factor. However, purification of the native enzyme in a large quantity is not practical due to its low productivity. To obtain the enzyme in a satisfactory yield, a gene encoding the NanI was transcriptionally fused to the fdx gene promoter (P(fdx)) in a shuttle-vector, pFF, and transformed into C. perfringens 13. The resultant strain released the enzyme into the culture medium, as the original strain does. The enzyme activity increased during the first 6 h of culture and thereafter remained at maximal levels. The maximal activity was approximately 3000-fold compared with that of the original strain, and 15-fold compared with that of recombinant Escherichia coli, which possesses extra copies of the tRNA gene for selected rare codons. This suggests the usefulness of a P(fdx)-based plasmid for expressing AT-rich genes in C. perfringens. The enzyme was successfully purified by two-step procedure with a specific activity of 2860 U/mg using 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid and a yield of 1.69 mg of NanI per 100 ml of culture. The method described here can facilitate purification of NanI in enough quality and quantity to analyze the role of sialoglycoconjugates in cells and the pathogenic importance of NanI sialidase.
TI  - Screening of the equine intestinal microflora for potential probiotic organisms.
AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Probiotics have not been demonstrated to provide any beneficial health effects in horses, possibly because of improper selection of probiotic organisms. This study was designed to identify lactic acid bacteria of equine origin with predetermined beneficial properties which might make them useful as therapeutic probiotics. HYPOTHESIS: A small percentage of lactic acid bacteria that are native to the intestinal tract of horses possess properties that may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of gastrointestinal disease in horses. METHODS: Faecal samples were collected from healthy mature horses and foals. Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and tested for the ability to grow in acid and bile environments, aerotolerance and in vitro inhibition of enteropathogens. One isolate that possessed these properties was administered orally to healthy mature horses and foals and gastrointestinal survival was assessed. RESULTS: Of the 47 tested organisms, 18 were deemed to be adequately acid- and bile-tolerant. All were aerotolerant. Four organisms markedly inhibited Salmonella spp. One isolate, Lactobacillus pentosus WE7, was subjectively superior and chosen for further study. It was also inhibitory against E. coli, moderately inhibitory against S. zooepidemicus and C. difficile and mildly inhibitory against C. perfringens. After oral administration, this isolate was recovered from the faeces of 8/9 (89%) foals and 7/8 (87.5%) mature horses. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus pentosus WE7 possesses in vitro and in vivo properties that may be useful for the prevention and treatment of enteric disease in horses. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The beneficial in vitro and in vivo properties that L. pentosus WE7 possesses indicate that randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled efficacy studies are warranted.
TI  - [Emphysematous cystitis complicated by bladder perforation: diagnosis and treatment of a rare case].
AB  - Emphysematous cystitis is a rare disease mainly encountered in poorly controlled  diabetics, immunodepressed patients or patients with infravesical obstruction. The pathophysiology of this disease is characterized by the formation of carbon dioxide (CO2) present in the lumen and/or bladder wall, derived from bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates. The bacteria most frequently responsible are facultative aerobes-anaerobes (Escherichia coli) and more rarely strict anaerobes (Clostridium perfringens). The authors report a case of emphysematous cystitis in a context of pelvic trauma and fracture of the pelvis, complicated by secondary bladder rupture. The diagnostic and therapeutic aspects are discussed.
TI  - Survey of peafowl (Pavo cristatus) for potential pathogens at three Michigan zoos.
AB  - Blood samples collected from 31 free-roaming peafowl from three zoos in Michigan  were tested serologically. Antibody titers were present against avian adenovirus and Bordetella avium in 19.3% and 61.3% of the samples, respectively. Serum plate agglutination tests were positive for Mycoplasma meleagridis and Mycoplasma synoviae in 3.2% and 38.7% of the samples, respectively. All birds were seronegative for avian influenza, Newcastle disease virus, West Nile virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella typhimurium, and Giardia sp. No parasites were seen in blood smears. Cloacal swabs were cultured for anaerobic, aerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria. Clostridium perfringens type A and Escherichia coli were cultured most frequently from 64.5% and 29% of the samples, respectively, whereas Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were not isolated. Fecal samples contained moderate numbers of ascarid and Capillaria sp. ova and coccidian oocysts. Female biting lice (Goniodes gigas) were identified on three birds.
TI  - The large resolvase TnpX is the only transposon-encoded protein required for transposition of the Tn4451/3 family of integrative mobilizable elements.
AB  - Chloramphenicol resistance in Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile is often encoded by catP genes located within the 6.3 kb integrative mobilizable elements Tn4451 and Tn4453 respectively. This family of transposons is capable of being mobilized into a recipient cell in the presence of another conjugative element. Transposition is mediated by the large resolvase TnpX, which excises the element to produce a circular molecule that is the integrative intermediate. In this study, in vivo deletion analysis of the transposon-encoded tnpV and tnpY genes showed that they are not essential for excision or integration of this group of elements. Similar studies on tnpW suggested either that this gene is not essential for these functions or that TnpW does not function when provided in trans. Development and use of an in vivo insertion assay showed that TnpX is the only transposon-encoded protein required for the integration reaction. Subsequently, a TnpXLEH6 protein was purified and shown to catalyse excision in vitro in the absence of any other protein and preferentially to excise a supercoiled DNA substrate. In summary, these studies have shown that TnpX is the only transposon protein required in vivo and in vitro for the excision process and that, like excision, integration also occurs by a serine recombinase-mediated site-specific recombination mechanism.
TI  - A second tylosin resistance determinant, Erm B, in Arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  - Arcanobacterium pyogenes, a common inhabitant of the mucosal surfaces of livestock, is also a pathogen associated with a variety of infections. In livestock, A. pyogenes is exposed to antimicrobial agents used for prophylaxis and therapy, notably tylosin, a macrolide used extensively for the prevention of liver abscessation in feedlot cattle in the United States. Many, but not all, tylosin-resistant A. pyogenes isolates carry erm(X), suggesting the presence of other determinants of tylosin resistance. Oligonucleotide primers designed for conserved regions of erm(B), erm(C), and erm(T) were used to amplify a 404-bp fragment from a tylosin-resistant A. pyogenes isolate, OX-7. DNA sequencing revealed that the PCR product was 100% identical to erm(B) genes, and the erm(B) gene region was cloned in Escherichia coli. The A. pyogenes Erm B determinant had the most DNA identity with an Erm B determinant carried by the Clostridium perfringens plasmid pIP402. However, the A. pyogenes determinant lacked direct repeat DR1 and contained a deletion in DR2. Flanking the A. pyogenes erm(B) gene were partial and entire genes similar to those found on the Enterococcus faecalis multiresistance plasmid pRE25. This novel architecture suggests that the erm(B) element may have arisen by recombination of two distinct genetic elements. Ten of 32 tylosin-resistant isolates carried erm(B), as determined by DNA hybridization, and all 10 isolates carried a similar element. Insertion of the element was site specific, as PCR and Southern blotting analysis revealed that the erm(B) element was inserted into orfY, a gene of unknown function. However, in three strains, this insertion resulted in a partial duplication of orfY.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a recombinant alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alphaNAG) hydrolyzed the terminal N-acetyl-alpha-d-galactosamine from the blood type A(2) antigen producing H antigen, blood type O. Blood type O is universally compatible in the ABO system. Purification of the native enzyme is difficult with very low yields. To obtain the enzyme in satisfactory yield, the gene encoding the clostridial enzyme was cloned in an Escherichia coli T7 expression system. A highly purified preparation of recombinant alphaNAG was obtained from cell lysates by ion-exchange chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The final preparation was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 71.96kDa and the native molecular weight of 72.42kDa. The enzyme was highly selective for terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues. No other significant exoglycosidase activities, particularly neuraminidase, were detected. The pH optimum of the enzyme was between 6.5 and 7.0 and activity was relatively unaffected by ionic strength. ELISA experiments demonstrated activity against blood type A(2) epitope. These characteristics were similar to those of native alphaNAG from C. perfringens. With adequate expression in E. coli, sufficient recombinant alphaNAG enzyme mass can be obtained for potential use in enzymatic conversion of human blood type A(2) red blood cells to universally transfusable type O red blood cells.
TI  - In vivo characterization of Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 for use as a defined competitive exclusion agent against bacterial pathogens in poultry.
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 in reducing the colonization and shedding of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis, Escherichia coli O78:K80 and Clostridium perfringens in poultry. METHODS AND RESULTS: Specific pathogen-free chicks (1 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) CFU. Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 and 24 h later were challenged in separate experiments with S. Enteritidis (S1400, nalr) and E. coli O78:K80 (EC34195, nalr). There were no significant effects against S. Enteritidis whereas colonization of the small intestine by E. coli O78:K80 was reduced significantly. Both S. Enteritidis and E. coli colonized the caeca and colon to levels equivalent to control birds and there was no reduction in shedding as assessed by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique. Specific pathogen-free chicks (20 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) CFU L. johnsonii FI9785 and 24 h later were challenged with C. perfringens. A single oral dose of L. johnsonii FI9785 was sufficient to suppress all aspects of colonization and persistence of C. perfringens. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 may be given to poultry for use as a competitive exclusion agent to control C. perfringens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 may be a valuable tool to control the endemic disease of necrotic enteritis, thereby reducing economic losses associated with reduced use of antimicrobials in the poultry industry.
TI  - Development and validation of experimental protocols for use of cardinal models for prediction of microorganism growth in food products.
AB  - An experimental protocol to validate secondary-model application to foods was suggested. Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella were observed in various food categories, such as meat, dairy, egg, or seafood products. The secondary model validated in this study was based on the gamma concept, in which the environmental factors temperature, pH, and water activity (aw) were introduced as individual terms with microbe-dependent parameters, and the effect of foodstuffs on the growth rates of these species was described with a food- and microbe-dependent parameter. This food-oriented approach was carried out by challenge testing, generally at 15 and 10 degrees C for L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B. cereus, and Salmonella and at 25 and 20 degrees C for C. perfringens. About 222 kinetics in foods were generated. The results were compared to simulations generated by existing software, such as PMP. The bias factor was also calculated. The methodology to obtain a food-dependent parameter (fitting step) and therefore to compare results given by models with new independent data (validation step) is discussed in regard to its food safety application. The proposed methods were used within the French national program of predictive microbiology, Sym'Previus, to include challenge test results in the database and to obtain predictive models designed for microbial growth in food products.
TI  - The role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  - Bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. Bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, E1 Tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) Escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) Shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) Clostridium difficile (toxins A and B); (f) Staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) Bacillus cereus (cytotoxin K and haemolysin BL); and (h) Aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). The mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane receptor. These effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, IP(3), Ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed Ca2+ and K+ permeable channels, which increase Ca2+ flux and augment changes in Ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane potential. Consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, are affected. The toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. Although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.
TI  - Use of reflectors to enhance the synergistic effects of solar heating and solar wavelengths to disinfect drinking water sources.
AB  - Aluminum reflectors were added to solar units designed to inactivate faecal microorganisms (faecal coliform, E. coli, enterococci, FRNA coliphage, C. perfringens) in stream water and diluted sewage by the two mechanisms (solar heat, solar UV) known to inactivate microorganisms. During sunny conditions, solar units with and without reflectors inactivated E. coli to <1 CFU/100 ml to meet drinking water standards. Solar units with reflectors disinfected the water sooner by increasing the water temperature by 8-10 degrees C to 64-75 degrees C. However, FRNA coliphages were still detected in these samples, indicating that this treatment may not inactivate pathogenic human enteric viruses. During cloudy conditions, reflectors only increased the water temperature by 3-4 degrees C to a maximum of 43-49 degrees C and E. coli was not completely inactivated. Under sunny and cloudy conditions, the UV wavelengths of sunlight worked synergistically with increasing water temperatures and were able to disinfect microorganisms at temperatures (45-56 degrees C), which were not effective in inactivating microorganisms. Relative resistance to the solar disinfecting effects were C. perfringens > FRNA coliphages > enterococci > E. coli > faecal coliform.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the human-specific toxin intermedilysin.
AB  - Intermedilysin is a human-specific toxin from Streptococcus intermedius, which is part of normal human oral flora. The bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen with a tendency for deep-seated infection in the brain and liver. Intermedilysin belongs to the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDCs) family of toxins, which have been identified in several different bacteria including the serious human pathogens S. pneumoniae and Clostridium perfringens. Intermedilysin, however, is the only member that shows exclusive specificity for human cells. The toxin has a couple of non-conservative amino-acid substitutions in a tryptophan-rich region of the molecule (Cys to Ala and Trp to Pro), the most conserved region amongst the CDCs. Mutations in this region are known to render other CDCs inactive. In order to investigate the structure-function relationships of the unusual features of intermedilysin, which will help us to understand the molecular mechanism of the toxin family in general, recombinant intermedilysin has been crystallized. The crystals belong to an orthorhombic space group and contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected to 2.3 A using synchrotron radiation.
TI  - Campylobacter spp., Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., noroviruses, and indicator organisms in surface water in southwestern Finland, 2000-2001.
AB  - A total of 139 surface water samples from seven lakes and 15 rivers in southwestern Finland were analyzed during five consecutive seasons from autumn 2000 to autumn 2001 for the presence of various enteropathogens (Campylobacter spp., Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and noroviruses) and fecal indicators (thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and F-RNA bacteriophages) and for physicochemical parameters (turbidity and temperature); this was the first such systematic study. Altogether, 41.0% (57 of 139) of the samples were positive for at least one of the pathogens; 17.3% were positive for Campylobacter spp. (45.8% of the positive samples contained Campylobacter jejuni, 25.0% contained Campylobacter lari, 4.2% contained Campylobacter coli, and 25.0% contained Campylobacter isolates that were not identified), 13.7% were positive for Giardia spp., 10.1% were positive for Cryptosporidium spp., and 9.4% were positive for noroviruses (23.0% of the positive samples contained genogroup I and 77.0% contained genogroup II). The samples were positive for enteropathogens significantly (P < 0.05) less frequently during the winter season than during the other sampling seasons. No significant differences in the prevalence of enteropathogens were found when rivers and lakes were compared. The presence of thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli, and C. perfringens had significant bivariate nonparametric Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients (P < 0.001) with samples that were positive for one or more of the pathogens analyzed. The absence of these indicators in a logistic regression model was found to have significant predictive value (odds ratios, 1.15 x 10(8), 7.57, and 2.74, respectively; P < 0.05) for a sample that was negative for the pathogens analyzed. There were no significant correlations between counts or count levels for thermotolerant coliforms or E. coli or the presence of F-RNA phages and pathogens in the samples analyzed.
TI  - Duplex real-time SYBR green PCR assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (T(m)) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. No interference with the LC-PCR assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. The detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool. The protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. However, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.
TI  - A new Bacteroides conjugative transposon that carries an ermB gene.
AB  - The erythromycin resistance gene ermB has been found in a variety of gram-positive bacteria. This gene has also been found in Bacteroides species but only in six recently isolated strains; thus, the gene seems to have entered this genus only recently. One of the six Bacteroides ermB-containing isolates, WH207, could transfer ermB to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain BT4001 by conjugation. WH207 was identified as a Bacteroides uniformis strain based on the sequence of its 16S rRNA gene. Results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis experiments demonstrated that the transferring element was normally integrated into the Bacteroides chromosome. The element was estimated from pulsed-field gel data to be about 100 kb in size. Since the element appeared to be a conjugative transposon (CTn), it was designated CTnBST. CTnBST was able to mobilize coresident plasmids and the circular form of the mobilizable transposon NBU1 to Bacteroides and Escherichia coli recipients. A 13-kb segment that contained ermB was cloned and sequenced. Most of the open reading frames in this region had little similarity at the amino acid sequence level to any proteins in the sequence databases, but a 1,723-bp DNA segment that included a 950-bp segment downstream of ermB had a DNA sequence that was virtually identical to that of a segment of DNA found previously in a Clostridium perfringens strain. This finding, together with the finding that ermB is located on a CTn, supports the hypothesis that CTnBST could have entered Bacteroides from some other genus, possibly from gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, this finding supports the hypothesis that many transmissible antibiotic resistance genes in Bacteroides are carried on CTns.
TI  - Wessex shopping basket survey - a structured approach to local food sampling.
AB  - The shopping basket approach to food sampling, in which ready-to-eat food items from a shopping list were sampled at premises chosen at random, was adopted by 15 Environmental Health Departments in the Wessex region. A total of 2037 samples were analysed over a 30-month period. The microbiological quality varied considerably between food categories, with gravy and stock samples giving the highest proportion of satisfactory results. Sliced meats, cooked rice and sandwiches gave the poorest overall results. Whilst the majority of unsatisfactory results were due to elevated levels of indicator organisms (Aerobic Colony Count, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli), unsatisfactory or potentially hazardous levels of pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens or Listeria monocytogenes) were detected in 1% of samples. Salmonella was not detected in any sample. The shopping basket survey was considered to be a useful way of structuring local sampling, and the random selection of premises was found to be a considerable advantage over previous sampling plans. In addition, the survey drew attention to a number of microbiological problems with specific food types, leading to more detailed investigations.
TI  - Biliary tract infection in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of infective microorganisms in the bilio-pancreatic tract is believed to be important in both the onset and outcome of acute biliary pancreatitis. In this study, the characteristics of bile colonization or infection in human pancreatitis were investigated in order to optimize prophylactic antibiotic therapy. METHODS: In 174 patients, 22 clinical and biological factors were recorded prospectively on admission and compared with the bacteriological findings at the time of surgery. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between patients with negative or positive bile cultures in six parameters: Age (57.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 68.5 +/- 1.5 years, p < 0.001), serum concentrations of glucose (132 +/- 4 vs. 149 +/- 6 mg/dL, p < 0.02) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (304 +/- 28 vs. 226 +/- 25 IU/L, p < 0.05) and hematocrit (43.4 +/- 0.4% vs. 41.7 +/- 0.5%, p < 0.05), Glasgow pancreatitis score (1.58 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.97 +/- 0.10, p < 0.01) and APACHE II score (6.20 +/- 0.38 vs. 7.82 +/- 0.35, p < 0.005). The prediction of the presence of bacteria in bile by each of these individual parameters, however, was of variable accuracy. From 82 patients with positive bile cultures, a total of 150 microorganisms were isolated, including 66 gram-positive aerobes, 66 gram-negative facultative anaerobes, 15 obligate anaerobes, and three fungi. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (20.6%), followed by enterococci (18%) and streptococci (15.3%). CONCLUSION: Patients with acute biliary pancreatitis who manifest abnormalities of one or more of the above-mentioned risk factors are more likely to have positive bile cultures. Whether such patients might benefit from early antibiotic therapy directed against both gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci needs to be determined.
TI  - Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  - To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bactericidal effects of Japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. Konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the pH of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). Konjac fluids completely inactivated Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and E. coil O26:H9, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahemolyticus. and Staphylococcus aureus. The initial level of 6 log CFU/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable S. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. On the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum type E and type A). At least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. Vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. When the initial cell count was 6 log CFU/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected after 120 days. When the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log CFU/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within I to 3 days. Repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. Our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.
TI  - Bacterial-associated diarrhea in the dog: a critical appraisal.
AB  - The clinical documentation of enteropathogenic bacteria causing diarrhea in dogs  is clouded by the presence of many of these organisms existing as normal constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora. The diagnosis of a putative bacterial enteropathogen(s) in dogs should be made based on a combination of parameters, including signalment and predisposing factors, clinical signs, serologic assays for toxins, fecal culture, and PCR. Relying on results of fecal culture alone is problematic, because C perfringens, C difficile, Campylobacter spp, and pathogenic and non-pathogenic E coli are commonly isolated from apparently healthy dogs [10,13,33]. Nevertheless, culture may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques, such as PCR, for detection of specific toxin genes or molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks. The oversimplistic attempt to characterize bacterially associated diarrhea by anatomic localization of clinical signs should be discouraged, because most of the previously mentioned bacteria have been associated with small and large intestinal diarrhea. Accurate diagnosis of infections may require diagnostic laboratories to incorporate PCR-based assays using genus- and species-specific primers to facilitate detection of toxin genes and differentiation of species that appear phenotypically and biochemically similar. There has been tremendous interest in the application of microarray technology for the simultaneous detection of thousands of genes or target DNA sequences on one glass slide. This powerful tool could be used for detection of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in fecal specimens obtained from dogs in the future.
TI  - Distribution of potential type II restriction sites (palindromes) in prokaryotes.
AB  - Restriction-modification systems are used as a defensive mechanism against inappropriate invasion of foreign DNA. The recognition sequences for the common type II restriction enzymes and their corresponding methylases are usually palindromes. In this study, we identified the most over- and underrepresented words in DNA of four bacteria: Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using maximum order Markov chain analysis, we found that palindromic words were most often more underrepresented than their non-palindromic counterparts. No strict rule for the intragenic palindrome content could be derived, but for three of the bacteria there was a weak correlation between codon usage bias and palindrome content. A clear drop in palindrome counts was observed in the Shine-Dalgarno region for B. subtilis and C. perfringens, but not in E. coli or P. aeruginosa. It was also shown that palindromes in eubacteria and archaebacteria seem to occur slightly more infrequently than expected on the basis of the genomic GC-content, but some exceptions to this principle exist.
TI  - Identification of species of Brucella using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. The marked tendency of Brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification, make their classification difficult. We studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of Brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of Brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3. The results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of Brucella strains. Only one case of B. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. The rest of the microorganisms studied (Staphylococcus aureus, Strteptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. In the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. One of these comprises B. melitensis, another Brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of Brucella suis. The Brucella canis, Brucella ovis and Brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.
TI  - Duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. Here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. Using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. RESULTS: It is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. Furthermore, the GC3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. CONCLUSIONS: The results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. The importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. Therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.
TI  - Competitive exclusion by Bacillus subtilis spores of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and Clostridium perfringens in young chickens.
AB  - Cost effective control of avian diseases and food borne pathogens remains a high  priority for all sectors of the poultry industry with cleansing and disinfection, vaccination and competitive exclusion approaches being used widely. Previous studies showed that Bacillus subtilis PY79(hr) was an effective competitive exclusion agent for use in poultry to control avian pathogenic Escherichia coli serotype O78:K80. Here we report experiments that were undertaken to test the efficacy of B. subtilis PY79(hr) in the control of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and Clostridium perfringens in young chickens. To do this, 1-day-old and 20-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks were dosed with a suspension of B. subtilis spores prior to challenge with S. Enteritidis (S1400) and C. perfringens, respectively. For both challenge models, a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) spores given 24h prior to challenge was sufficient to suppress colonisation and persistence of both S. Enteritidis and C. perfringens. In particular, the faecal shedding of S. Enteritidis, as measured by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique, was reduced significantly for the 36 days duration of the experiment. B. subtilis persisted in the intestine although with decreasing numbers over the same period. These data add further evidence that B. subtilis spores may be effective agents in the control of avian diseases and food borne pathogens.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in Artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the Artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active constituents of the Artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides A and B by spectroscopic analysis. In a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B produced a clear inhibitory effect against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bif. breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. casei) and Escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards Bif. bifidum was observed. At 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards Cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards Bact. fragilis and Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides A and B towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of A. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These naturally occurring Artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
TI  - Comparative analysis of viral pathogens and potential indicators in shellfish.
AB  - Shellfish can be responsible of outbreaks of infectious diseases and current health measures do not guarantee the absence of viral pathogens in this product. Here we examine the presence of pathogenic viruses and potential indicators in shellfish in a comparative analysis.Sixty shellfish samples collected in three areas with different levels of faecal contamination were analysed for Escherichia coli, total coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, somatic coliphages, F-specific phages of RNA (F-RNA), bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis RYC2056, human adenovirus, enterovirus and hepatitis A virus (HAV). Viruses were eluted in a glycine buffer at pH 10. The overall percentage of viral pathogens detected was 47% for human adenoviruses, 19% for enteroviruses and 24% for HAV. Since all the samples positive for enterovirus and HAV were also positives for human adenovirus, the latter may be considered useful as a molecular index of viral contamination in shellfish. No significant differences in the bioaccumulation of bacteria and bacteriophages for oysters or mussels were observed. It was found that the probability of detection of any of the pathogenic virus decreases as the temperature of shellfish growing waters increases. However, the probability of detecting viruses increases when phages of B. fragilis are found. Although more data are needed in order to fulfil the need of viral indicators for controlling the presence of human viruses in shellfish, the obtained results indicate that phages infecting B. fragilis RYC2056 could be a suitable group of bacteriophages to be used as an indicator of the presence of viruses in shellfish.
TI  - Growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  - 2-Aminobiphenyl (2-ABP), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-ABP) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), but not benzidine (Bz) and biphenyl (Bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, B. bifidium ATCC 11863, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, YG1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. Bacteroides distasonis ATCC 8503, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, B. theataiotaomicron ATCC 29741, C. paraputrificum ATCC 26780, C. clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. It was found that 4-ABP was mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100, and Bz was mutagenic to TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-ABP, and Bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-Aminobiphenyl and 3-ABP are chemical isomers of 4-ABP and are as strong as 4-ABP in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-ABP. Evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of DNA that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
TI  - Chlorination and safe storage of household drinking water in developing countries to reduce waterborne disease.
AB  - Simple, effective and affordable methods are needed to treat and safely store non-piped, gathered household water. This study evaluated point-of-use chlorination and storage in special plastic containers of gathered household water for improving microbial quality and reducing diarrhoeal illness of consumers living under conditions of poor sanitation and hygiene. Community families were recruited and randomly divided into intervention (household water chlorination and storage in a special container) and control (no intervention) households. Microbes in stored household water were extensively inactivated by 1-5-mg/L doses of hypochlorite. Escherichia coli levels in stored household waters were < 1/100 mL in most intervention households but readily detectable at high levels in control households. Stored water of intervention households was also lower in Clostridium perfringens and heterotrophic plate count bacteria than in control households. The intervention reduced household diarrhoeal illness. In Bolivia, monthly episodes of household diarrhoeal illness were 1.25 and 2.2 in intervention and control families, respectively (P = < 0.002) indicating that 43% of community diarrhoea was preventable by using the intervention. In Bangladesh, mean episodes of child diarrhoea/1,000 d were 19.6 and 24.8 in intervention and control groups respectively (P = < 0.03) indicating that about 24% of observed diarrhoea was preventable by using the intervention. Chlorine disinfection and storage in an appropriate container significantly improved the microbiological quality of non-piped household drinking water and reduced community diarrhoeal disease. Widespread use of this simple treatment and storage system for non-piped domestic water has the potential to dramatically reduce the global burden of waterborne diarrhoeal disease.
TI  - Effects of gamma ray and electron-beam irradiations on survival of anaerobic and  facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An extension of the approval for food irradiation is desired due to the increase  in the incidence of food poisoning in the world. One anaerobic (Clostridium perfringens) and four facultatively anaerobic (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella Enteritidis) bacteria irradiated with gamma ray or electron beam (E-beam) were tested in terms of survival on agar under packaging atmosphere. Using pouch pack, effects of two irradiations on survival of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were evaluated comparatively. E-beam irradiation was more effective than gamma ray irradiation in decreasing the D10 value of B. cereus at 4 degrees C, slightly more effective in that of E. coli O157, and similarly effective in that of the other three bacteria at 4 degrees C. The gamma irradiation of the bacteria without incubation at 4 degrees C before irradiation was more effective than that of the bacteria with incubation overnight at 4 degrees C before irradiation in decreasing the D10 values of these bacteria (B. cereus, E. coli O157, and L. monocytogenes). Furthermore, ground beef patties inoculated with bacteria were irradiated with 1 kGy by E-beam (5 MeV) at 4 degrees C. The inoculated bacteria in the 1-9 mm beef patties were killed by 1 kGy E-beam irradiation and some bacteria in more than 9 mm beef patties were not killed by the irradiation.
TI  - Viability of Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes surviving mild heat or aqueous ozone treatment on beef followed by heat, alkali, or salt stress.
AB  - The threat of pathogen survival following ozone treatment of meat necessitates careful evaluation of the microorganisms surviving under such circumstances. The objective of this study was to determine whether sublethal aqueous ozone treatment (3 ppm of O3 for 5 min) of microorganisms on beef surfaces would result in increased or decreased survival with respect to subsequent heat, alkali, or NaCl stress. A mild heat treatment (55 degrees C for 30 min) was used for comparison. Reductions in three-strain cocktails of Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes on beef following the heat treatment were 0.14, 0.77, and 1.47 log10 CFU/g, respectively, whereas reductions following ozone treatment were 1.28, 0.85, and 1.09 log10 CFU/g, respectively. C. perfringens cells exhibited elevated heat resistance at 60 degrees C (D60 [time at 60 degrees C required to reduce the viable cell population by 1 log10 units or 90%] = 17.76 min) following heat treatment of beef (55 degrees C for 30 min) but exhibited reduced viability at 60 degrees C following ozone treatment (D60 = 7.64 min) compared with the viability of untreated control cells (D60 = 13.84 min). The D60-values for L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 following heat and ozone exposures were not significantly different (P > 0.05). C. perfringens cells that survived ozone treatment did not exhibit increased resistance to pH (pH 6 to 12) relative to non-ozone-treated cells when grown at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The heat treatment also resulted in decreased numbers of surviving cells above and below neutral pH values for both E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes relative to those of non-heat-treated cells grown at 37 degrees C for 24 h. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in C. perfringens reductions with increasing NaCl concentrations. The effects of NaCl were less apparent for E. coli and L. monocytogenes survivors. It is concluded that pathogens surviving ozone treatment of beef are less likely to endanger food safety than are those surviving sublethal heat treatments.
TI  - Non-randomness in Shine-Dalgarno regions: links to gene characteristics.
AB  - A probabilistic approach to the study of the Shine-Dalgarno region was used to identify the most non-random positions based on parsing of genomes in four species: Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, the AT-rich Clostridium perfringens, and the GC-rich Streptomyces coelicolor. The compositional non-randomness shows a clear peak centered around 9-11 nucleotides upstream of the start codon. This peak was in all species associated with guanine as the most abundant nucleotide, flanked by guanine in the closest proximity and adenines farther away (cytosine in case of S. coelicolor). Using contingency tables, the nucleotides in the Shine-Dalgarno region were shown to have a strong association to the choice of start codons. We also show that gene characteristics such as length, aromaticity, and lipophilicity are related to the nucleotide at this peak position upstream of the start codon.
TI  - Eubacterium bacteremia and colon cancer.
AB  - Eubacterium bacteremia is rare. We report a senile patient who presented with 3 episodes of bacteremia, caused by Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium limosum and Escherichia coli, respectively, which led to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon. A differential diagnosis of colon cancer should be considered in patients with eubacterium bacteremia.
TI  - The C-terminal domain of perfringolysin O is an essential cholesterol-binding unit targeting to cholesterol-rich microdomains.
AB  - There is much evidence to indicate that cholesterol forms lateral membrane microdomains (rafts), and to suggest their important role in cellular signaling. However, no probe has been produced to analyze cholesterol behavior, especially cholesterol movement in rafts, in real time. To obtain a potent tool for analyzing cholesterol dynamics in rafts, we prepared and characterized several truncated fragments of theta-toxin (perfringolysin O), a cholesterol-binding cytolysin, whose chemically modified form has been recently shown to bind selectively to rafts. BIAcore and structural analyses demonstrate that the C-terminal domain (domain 4) of the toxin is the smallest functional unit that has the same cholesterol-binding activity as the full-size toxin with structural stability. Cell membrane-bound recombinant domain 4 was detected in the floating low-density fractions and was found to be cofractionated with the raft-associated protein Lck, indicating that recombinant domain 4 also binds selectively to cholesterol-rich rafts. Furthermore, an enhanced green fluorescent protein-domain 4 fusion protein stains membrane surfaces in a cholesterol-dependent manner in living cells. Therefore, domain 4 of theta-toxin is an essential cholesterol-binding unit targeting to cholesterol in membrane rafts, providing a very useful tool for further studies on lipid rafts on cell surfaces and inside cells.
TI  - Innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. The aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. Mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus mitis, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Veillonella parvula, and Neisseria sicca. The levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TNF-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking CD14, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), and TLR-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. The levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. Gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. The levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of IL-10 were similar in newborns and adults. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in cord cells. L. plantarum bound or signaled through CD14, TLR-2, and TLR-4, whereas E. coli acted mainly through CD14 and TLR-4. These results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.
TI  - Trends in indigenous foodborne disease and deaths, England and Wales: 1992 to 2000.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Commitment to food safety is evidenced by high profile governmental initiatives around the globe. To measure progress towards targets, policy makers need to know the baseline from which they started. AIM: To describe the burden (mortality, morbidity, new presentations to general practice, hospital admissions, and hospital occupancy) and trends of indigenous foodborne disease (IFD) in England and Wales between 1992 and 2000. METHODS: Routinely available surveillance data, special survey data, and hospital episode statistics were collated and arithmetic employed to estimate the burden and trends of IFD in England and Wales. Adjustments were made for underascertainment of disease through national surveillance and for foreign travel. The final estimates were compared with those from the USA. RESULTS: In 1995 there were an estimated 2,365,909 cases, 21,138 hospital admissions, and 718 deaths in England and Wales due to IFD. By 2000 this had fallen to 1,338,772 cases, 20,759 hospital admissions, and 480 deaths. In terms of disease burden the most important pathogens were campylobacters, salmonellas, Clostridium perfringens, verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157, and Listeria monocytogenes. The ratio of food related illness in the USA to IFD in England and Wales in 2000 was 57:1. Taking into account population rates, this ratio fell to 11:1 and converged when aetiology and disease severity were considered. CONCLUSION: Reducing IFD in England and Wales means tackling campylobacter. Lowering mortality rates however also requires better control and prevention of salmonellas, Cl perfringens, L monocytogenes, and VTEC O157.
TI  - Brewers dried yeast as a source of mannan oligosaccharides for weanling pigs.
AB  - Brewers dried yeast, a source of mannan oligosaccharides (MOS), was assessed as an alternative to an antimicrobial agent (carbadox) for young pigs in two experiments. The yeast contained 5.2% MOS. Agglutination tests confirmed adsorption of several serovars of E. coli and Salmonella spp. onto the yeast product. In Exp. 1, seven replicates (five pigs per pen) of 22-d-old pigs were fed a nonmedicated basal diet or the basal diet with carbadox (55 mg/kg), yeast (3%), or a combination of 3% yeast and 2% citric acid for 28 d. Carbadox did not improve growth performance. Growth rate and feed intake were depressed (P < 0.05) in pigs fed yeast alone or in combination with acid. Log counts of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens in feces were not affected by diet, but Bifidobacteria spp. counts were lower (P < 0.05) in pigs fed the yeast + acid diet and lactobacilli counts were higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed yeast. Fecal pH and VFA concentrations and intestinal morphological traits were not consistently affected by diet. Serum IgG levels were elevated in the yeast + acid (P < 0.01) group. In Exp. 2, the effects of yeast and carbadox additions to the diet on enteric microbial populations in young pigs housed in isolation units were evaluated. Pigs (n = 24) were weaned at 11 d of age (4.1 kg BW) and placed in isolation chambers (two pigs per chamber) equipped with individual air filtering systems and excrement containers. Treatments were a nonmedicated basal diet and the basal diet with 55 mg/kg of carbadox or with 3% yeast. Diets were fed for 29 d, then each pig was orally dosed with approximately 9.5 x 10(8) CFU of E. coli K88. Daily fecal E. coli K88 counts were not different (P > 0.05) among treatments, but fecal shedding of carbadox-resistant coliforms was higher (P < 0.01) during the 9-d period in pigs fed carbadox. Total fecal coliforms were consistently lower throughout the postinoculation period in pigs fed yeast (P < 0.05). Yeast reduced colonization oftotal coliforms in the duodenum,jejunum, cecum, and colon, but it did not have a consistent effect on colonization of E. coli K88. Pigs fed yeast tended (P < 0.10) to have higher serum IgG levels than controls. In these experiments, brewers dried yeast and carbadox had minimal effects on growth, microbial populations, and intestinal health traits of early-weaned pigs, but certain serum immunological traits were enhanced by feeding yeast.
TI  - The murein hydrolase of the bacteriophage phi3626 dual lysis system is active against all tested Clostridium perfringens strains.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens commonly occurs in food and feed, can produce an enterotoxin frequently implicated in food-borne disease, and has a substantial negative impact on the poultry industry. As a step towards new approaches for control of this organism, we investigated the cell wall lysis system of C. perfringens bacteriophage phi3626, whose dual lysis gene cassette consists of a holin gene and an endolysin gene. Hol3626 has two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and is a group II holin. A positively charged beta turn between the two MSDs suggests that both the amino terminus and the carboxy terminus of Hol3626 might be located outside the cell membrane, a very unusual holin topology. Holin function was experimentally demonstrated by using the ability of the holin to complement a deletion of the heterologous phage lambda S holin in lambdadeltaSthf. The endolysin gene ply3626 was cloned in Escherichia coli. However, protein synthesis occurred only when bacteria were supplemented with rare tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Ile) genes. Formation of inclusion bodies could be avoided by drastically lowering the expression level. Amino-terminal modification by a six-histidine tag did not affect enzyme activity and enabled purification by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Ply3626 has an N-terminal amidase domain and a unique C-terminal portion, which might be responsible for the specific lytic range of the enzyme. All 48 tested strains of C. perfringens were sensitive to the murein hydrolase, whereas other clostridia and bacteria belonging to other genera were generally not affected. This highly specific activity towards C. perfringens might be useful for novel biocontrol measures in food, feed, and complex microbial communities.
TI  - Environmental response and autoregulation of Clostridium difficile TxeR, a sigma  factor for toxin gene expression.
AB  - TxeR, a sigma factor that directs Clostridium difficile RNA polymerase to recognize the promoters of two major toxin genes, was shown to stimulate its own synthesis. Whether expressed in C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, or Escherichia coli, TxeR stimulated transcription of fusions of the txeR promoter region to reporter genes. As is the case for the tox genes, txeR expression was responsive to the cellular growth phase and the constituents of the medium. That is, the level of expression in broth culture was low during the exponential growth phase, but rapidly increased as cells approached the stationary phase. In the presence of excess glucose, expression from the txeR promoter was repressed. The results support a model for toxin gene expression in which synthesis of TxeR is induced by specific environmental signals. The increased level of TxeR then permits high-level expression of the toxin genes. The study of txeR gene regulation in C. difficile was made possible by introduction of a mobilizable, replicative plasmid via conjugation with E. coli.
TI  - Analysis of heat shock protein 60 encoding genes of mycoplasmas and investigations concerning their role in immunity and infection.
AB  - Only little is known about the heat shock proteins (Hsp) and Hsp-encoding genes of mycoplasmas. The aim of this study was to identify and sequence the hsp60 gene of Mycoplasma agalactiae, Mycoplasma arthritidis, Mycoplasma bovis, and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and to investigate the immune response to Hsp60. Fragments of the hsp60 genes of M. agalactiae, M. arthritidis, M. bovis and M. hyopneumoniae representing almost the entire coding region were amplified by PCR. Two fragments of a hsp60 gene were cloned in Escherichia coli and the antibody response of pigs infected with M. hyopneumoniae against the recombinant Hsp60 fusion proteins was analysed. Within the mycoplasmas, the hsp60 genes showed sequence identities of nearly 100%, with the exception of the hsp60 gene of Mycoplasma genitalium, which was determined to be only 76.5-77.7% identical. Identities to Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis and E. coli were determined between approximately 50 and 60%. The predicted amino acid sequences of Hsp60 showed an identity of 90 to nearly 100% among mycoplasmas and 50-60% to the other bacteria indicated above. Two Hsp60 derived glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins containing mycoplasma peptides of 28 and 35kDa were isolated. M. hyopneumoniae-ELISA positive porcine convalescent sera reacted strongly with the recombinant Hsp60 fusion proteins in Western immunoblotting indicating for the first time that mycoplasmal Hsp60 is immunogenic in natural infection.
TI  - The effect of different cooking procedures on microbiological and chemical quality characteristics of Tekirdag meatballs.
AB  - In this research, the effects of different cooking processes (grilling, oven, and microwave cooking) on microbial flora and chemical composition of the raw and cooked meatballs as consumed in Tekirdag were investigated. Microbial flora of the raw meatballs was as follows: total bacteria, 6.02 x 10(6) cfu/g; psychrophilic bacteria, 1.3 x 10(5) cfu/g; yeast and mould, 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g; coliforms, 1.1 x 10(5) cfu/g; Escherichia coli, 1.0 x 10(2) cfu/g; total staphylococcae, 3.3 x 10(2) cfu/g; Staphylococcus aureus, 85 cfu/g. While Salmonella was found in only one sample, none of the samples contained Clostridium perfringens. The cooking processes clearly decreased the microbial flora (2-3 log cycles in grilling (71 degrees C) and oven-cooked (79 degrees C), 3-4 log cycles in microwave (97 degrees C) heating) of the meatballs. However, because of the crust formation and high moisture losses from the meatball surface in microwave heating, some sensorial defects were observed in the final product. Also, fat and moisture losses were higher in microwave cooking compared to the other cooking processes. In conclusion, it is advised to use slightly higher temperatures than used in the grilling or conventinal cooking procedures to increase microbial quality of the meatballs studied in this research.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Mapping of the Ia domain involved in docking  with Ib and cellular internalization.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens iota toxin consists of two unlinked proteins. The binding component (Ib) is required to internalize into cells an enzymatic component (Ia) that ADP-ribosylates G-actin. To characterize the Ia domain that interacts with Ib, fusion proteins were constructed between the C. botulinum C3 enzyme, which ADP-ribosylates Rho, and various truncated versions of Ia. These chimeric molecules retained the wild type ADP-ribosyltransferase activity specific for Rho and were recognized by antibodies against C3 enzyme and Ia. Internalization of each chimera into Vero cells was assessed by measuring the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Fusion proteins containing C3 linked to the C terminus of Ia were transported most efficiently into cells like wild type Ia in an Ib-dependent manner that was blocked by bafilomycin A1. The minimal Ia fragment that promoted translocation of Ia-C3 chimeras into cells consisted of 128 central residues (129-257). These findings revealed that iota toxin is a suitable system for mediating the entry of heterologous proteins such as C3 into cells.
TI  - Identification, molecular cloning and expression of an alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase gene from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens gene encoding the previously characterized alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alphaNAG) was identified by protein microsequencing and database searching. The alphaNAG protein, designated AagA, was found to be encoded by a hypothetical gene of unknown function in the recently completed genome sequence of C. perfringens strain 13. The deduced translation product of 629 amino acid residues possessed a region of limited homology to several hypothetical open reading frames, an enterotoxin of unknown function and several known or predicted alpha-galactosidases, but did not exhibit homology to any of the multiple sequenced eukaryotic alphaNAG proteins. The C. perfringens aagA gene, encoding AagA, was cloned in an Escherichia coli T7 expression system, resulting in recombinants exhibiting high-level expression of the expected alphaNAG activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and expression of a bacterial alphaNAG-encoding gene and represents an important step in the development of recombinant alphaNAG as a tool in the enzymatic conversion of blood group antigens.
TI  - French laboratory proficiency testing program for food microbiology.
AB  - The proficiency testing program in food microbiology (Reseau d'Analyses et d'Echanges en Microbiologie des Aliments; RAEMA), created in 1988, currently includes 440 participating laboratories. The program establishes proficiency in detection of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, as well as quantitation of aerobic microorganisms, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Twice a year, 5 test samples are sent to participants to assess their precision and trueness for enumeration and detection of microorganisms. Results show an increasing involvement of food microbiology laboratories in quality assurance programs and use of standard and validated analytical methods. However, the percentage of laboratories obtaining questionable and unsatisfactory microbiological results remains relatively constant.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin forms a heptameric pore within the detergent-insoluble microdomains of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and rat synaptosomes.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin, which is responsible for enterotoxaemia in ungulates, forms a heptamer in rat synaptosomal and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell membranes, leading to membrane permealization. Thus, the toxin may target the detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRMs) of these membranes, in analogy to aerolysin, a heptameric pore-forming toxin that associates with DRMs. To test this idea, we examined the distribution of radiolabeled epsilon-toxin in DRM and detergent-soluble membrane fractions of MDCK cells and rat synaptosomal membranes. When MDCK cells and synaptosomal membranes were incubated with the toxin and then fractionated by cold Triton X-100 extraction and flotation on sucrose gradients, the heptameric toxin was detected almost exclusively in DRMs. The results of a toxin overlay assay revealed that the toxin preferentially bound to and heptamerized in the isolated DRMs. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin abrogated their association and lowered the cytotoxicity of the toxin toward MDCK cells. When epsilon-protoxin, an inactive precursor able to bind to but unable to heptamerize in the membrane, was incubated with MDCK cell membranes, it was detected mainly in their DRMs. These results suggest that the toxin is concentrated and induced to heptamerize on binding to a putative receptor located preferentially in DRMs, with all steps from initial binding through pore formation completed within the same DRMs.
TI  - Regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surfaces of household containers used for the storage of drinking water in rural communities of South Africa.
AB  - The present study covered two rural communities of South Africa: Ncera and Ntselamanzi villages. Raw water from Ncera river is used by the community of Ncera village for drinking, while the community of Ntselamanzi receives their drinking water from Alice purification system. Treated water is supplied to the community by a public standpipe system. In rural communities of South Africa, many households use polyethylene (PE) and galvanized steel (GS) containers for the storage of their drinking water. To investigate the regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surface of household containers during the storage of drinking water, PE and GS slides were suspended in the appropriate household containers for a period of 48 h. This period of 48 h was chosen as the study period because results from the questionnaire indicated that the largest percentage (62%) of households store their water for that length of time. The experiment was performed to test drinking water as it is collected and stored by rural communities. No disinfection of household containers or slides was done during the study period. Attached coliphages (F-RNA (FP) and somatic phage (SP), coliform bacteria (total coliform (TC), presumptive Escherichia coli (EC), Salmonella (Sal) and Clostridium perfringens (CP) were measured during the study period. With the exception of CP, attached indicator microorganisms consisted of TC, presumptive E. coli and Salmonella, somatic and F-RNA coliphages, although the yield (average count) for the last four groups (EC: < 1-3 cfu cm(-2), Sal: < 1-15 cfu cm(-2), FP: < 1-7 pfu cm(-2), SP: < 1-7pfu cm(-2)) was lower than that of TC (3-183 cfu cm(-2)). However, the lowest yield of indicator microorganisms was noted for presumptive E. coli. Whereas the occurrence and survival of TC was noted on the surface of household containers during the entire period of the experimental study, other indicator microorganisms occurred from time to time. The regrowth of indicator microorganisms occurred 48 h after the exposure of slides to both types of test waters. This length of time mostly resulted in the regrowth of TC (with an increase in bacterial counts) while the persistence of other indicator organism groups on the surface of the slides was apparent. A comparison between PE and GS containers showed that more TC (average count) regrew on PE than on GS containers (for river water, PE: from 36 to 55 cfu cm(-2), GS: from 25 to 26 cfu cm(-2); for standpipe water, PE: from 147 to 183 cfu cm(-2), GS from 3 to 4 cfu cm(-2)). This study revealed that both types of household containers supported the growth and survival of indicator microorganisms due to the bad quality of the intake water before storage. The storage of drinking water for 48 h mainly resulted in the regrowth of TC. Nevertheless, the persistence of other indicator microorganisms was observed on the surface of household containers.
TI  - In vitro fermentation properties of selected fructooligosaccharide-containing vegetables and in vivo colonic microbial populations are affected by the diets of healthy human infants.
AB  - Salsify (Tragopogon porrifolius) and gobo (Arctium lappa) are root vegetables that contain high concentrations of naturally occurring fructooligosaccharides (FOS), nondigestible oligosaccharides that have prebiotic effects on the intestinal microflora. The objective of this study was to compare colonic microbial populations and the fermentation characteristics of gobo and salsify in breast-fed vs. formula-fed infants. Fecal inoculum from breast-fed and formula-fed infants consuming either no solid foods, cereal, or fruit and vegetable purees were fermented in vitro with sweet potato puree plus gobo, salsify puree or a control vegetable, carrot. Breast-fed and formula-fed infants had similar fecal bacteria concentrations, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens (P < 0.10). Introduction of solid foods into the diet of infants was associated with increased fecal concentrations of bifidobacteria (P < 0.10) and decreased concentrations of total aerobes (P < 0.01), C. perfringens (P < 0.001) and Escherichia coli (P < 0.10). Inoculum from feces of breast-fed infants resulted in greater acetate production, whereas inoculum from feces of formula-fed infants resulted in greater propionate and butyrate production (P < 0.05). Fermentation of FOS-containing vegetables by infant fecal inoculum did not differ significantly from fermentation of carrots as assessed by total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. The addition of solids to the diet of infants was associated with increased production of acetate and total SCFA (P < 0.05). It appears that both the composition and fermentative activity of the colonic microflora of human infants is affected by breast-feeding and solid food consumption, but not by short-term exposure to low concentrations of FOS-containing substrates.
TI  - Two novel oligosaccharides formed by 1F-fructosyltransferase purified from roots  of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.).
AB  - Two novel oligosaccharides, tetra-and penta-saccharides were synthesized by fructosyl transfer from 1-kestose to 4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose with a purified 1F-fructosyltransferase of asparagus roots and identified as 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose, O-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-O-[beta-D-galactopyranosy l-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and 1F(1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl)2-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose, [O-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)]2-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-O-[beta-D-galactopyran osyl-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, respectively. Both oligosaccharides were scarcely hydrolyzed by carbohydrase from rat small intestine. Human intestinal bacterial growth by 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose was compared with that by the tetrasaccharides, stachyose and nystose. Bifidobacteria utilized 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose to the same extent as stachyose or nystose. On the other hand, the unfavorable bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Enterococcusfaecalis, that produce mutagenic substances did not use the synthetic oligosaccharide.
TI  - A survey of agents associated with neonatal diarrhea in Iowa swine including Clostridium difficile and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.
AB  - This survey was undertaken to determine the relative frequency of agents that are currently associated with neonatal diarrhea in swine, including Clostridium difficile and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The subjects for this study were the first 100 live 1-7-day-old piglets submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory with a clinical signalment of diarrhea, beginning on January 1, 2000. The evaluation of each pig included bacterial culture of a section of ileum, 2 sections of jejunum, and a single section of colon; a fluorescent antibody test (FAT) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); ELISA's for rotavirus and C. difficile toxins; IHC for PRRSV; and microscopic examination of ileum, midjejunum, spiral colon, liver, spleen, and lung. Survey results demonstrate a decline in the relative number of diagnoses of TGEV, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens type C compared with retrospective data. The combined case frequency rate for these 3 pathogens dropped from 70% in 1988 to 21% in 2000. This survey also demonstrated the emergence of C. difficile as an important pathogen of neonatal swine. Clostridium difficle toxin was detected in the colon contents of 29% of the piglets, and at least 1 toxin-positive animal was identified in 55% of the cases. All 29 C. difficile toxin-positive piglets had mesocolonic edema, and colitis was observed in 21 of 29 toxin-positive animals. PRRSV-positive macrophages were detected in the lamina propria of intestinal villi by IHC in 10 piglets with diarrhea. In 6 of these cases, PRRSV was the only pathogen detected. Gross and microscopic lung lesions were not a reliable indicator of PRRSV infection in these neonatal pigs with diarrhea. The addition of tests for C. difficile and PRRSV to a routine neonatal diarrhea diagnostic protocol resulted in a significant increase in thediagnostic success rate on both individual animal and case bases.
TI  - Depuration dynamics of viruses in shellfish.
AB  - The consumption of shellfish has been associated with viral infections even in cases where shellfish complied with the current regulation, which is based on bacterial analysis. In this study, depuration rates of potential indicators and human viruses have been analysed in order to study the use of complementary parameters for evaluating the microbiological quality of depurated shellfish. Depuration of naturally highly polluted mussels has been evaluated and analyses for Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, somatic coliphages, F-RNA phages and bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis RYC2056 and HSP40, human adenovirus, enterovirus have been done. Seawater of the depuration tank was disinfected by UV irradiation, ozone and passed through a skimmer and a biological filter. The correct functioning of the depuration tank was monitored by the quantification of total organic carbon (TOC), NH4+ and total aerobic bacteria in the seawater. To study the relation between the bacteriophages and the human viruses analysed, a logistic regression model was applied. F-RNA phages are significantly related to human adenoviruses and enteroviruses. Thus, they can be used as a complementary parameter for evaluating the efficiency of the depuration treatment. Somatic coliphages are also significantly associated with enteroviruses. Bacteriophages infecting B. fragilis HSP40 were analysed by the double-agar-layer (DAL) method, which quantifies infectious viruses, and by nested PCR, which detects the presence of the genome of these phages. The highest sensitivity of the molecular techniques was demonstrated and the results obtained are an indicator of a close relation between positive results by PCR and the presence of infectious viral particles in shellfish. All shellfish samples were negative for human viruses by PCR after 5 days of depuration treatment and the results obtained applying a regression model also showed negative results or nearly for F-RNA phages and bacteriophages infecting B. fragilis RYC2056. Thus, in this specific depuration treatment, 5 days may be necessary to assess the sanitary quality of shellfish.
TI  - Evaluation of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - N-Acetylchitooligosaccharides ((GlcNAc)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. A chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using HCl. After purification, the purity of each (GlcNAc)(1-6) was >86%. The growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (BM) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium limosum could use (GlcNAc)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (GlcNac)(1-6). GlcNAc was used more readily than (GlcNAc)(2-6) by Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. In BM, Streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.
TI  - Reduction of enteric microbes in flushed swine wastewater treated by a biological aerated filter and UV irradiation.
AB  - An aerobic biofilter system was studied to assess its effectiveness for reducing  enteric microbial indicators in flushed swine wastewater under different seasonal conditions. A laboratory-scale, low-pressure UV collimated beam apparatus was used to investigate the effectiveness of UV irradiation for inactivating enteric bacteria, coliphages, and bacterial spores in treated and untreated swine wastewater having unfiltered absorbances of 5 to 11 cm(-1) and total suspended solids concentrations of 500 to 1200 mg/L. Fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, somatic coliphages, and male-specific coliphages were reduced by 97 to 99% in the biofilter system when reactor water temperatures were between 23 and 32 degrees C. Salmonella were reduced by 95 to 97% when water temperatures were 17 to 32 degrees C. Of the six microbial indicators studied. Clostridium perfringens spores were typically reduced the least by the biofilter system. At an average absorbed UV irradiation dose of 13 mJ/cm2, maximum reductions of fecal coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, C. perfringens spores, and somatic coliphages in biofilter system effluent were 2.2, 2.1, 1.3, 0.2, and 2.3 log10, respectively. The results of this study show that the aerobic biofilter system can be an effective alternative for treatment of flushed swine waste. Ultraviolet irradiation can be effective for further reducing enteric microbe concentrations in biologically-treated swine waste, as well as in lower quality wastewaters, indicating its general potential for pathogen reductions in low-quality wastewaters intended for beneficial reuse.
TI  - Microbial load of drinking water reservoir tributaries during extreme rainfall and runoff.
AB  - Hygienic and microbiological examinations of watercourses are usually not carried out during heavy rainfall and runoff events. After rainfall or snowmelt, there are often massive increases in turbidity in flooding creeks in mountain ranges, which are frequently interpreted as an indication of microbial contamination. The aim of this study was to quantify the microbial loads of watercourses during such runoff events and to compare these loads with loads occurring during regular conditions. In a 14-month monitoring period we investigated the microbial loads of three tributaries of different drinking water reservoirs. A total of 99 water samples were taken under different runoff conditions and analyzed to determine physical, chemical, bacterial, and parasitic parameters. Thirty-two water samples were considered event samples during nine measuring series. The criteria for events, based on duration and intensity of precipitation, water depth gauge measurements, and dynamics, had been fixed before the investigation for each creek individually. Of the physical and chemical parameters examined, only the turbidity, pH, and nitrate values differed clearly from the values obtained for regular samples. Most of the bacteriological parameters investigated (colony, Escherichia coli, coliform, fecal streptococcal, and Clostridium perfringens counts) increased considerably during extreme runoff events. If relevant sources of parasitic contamination occurred in catchment areas, the concentrations of Giardia and Cryptosporidium rose significantly during events. The results show that substantial shares of the total microbial loads in watercourses and in drinking water reservoirs result from rainfall and extreme runoff events. Consequently, regular samples are considered inadequate for representing the microbial contamination of watercourse systems. The procedures for raw water surveillance in the context of multiple-barrier protection and risk assessment ought to include sampling during extreme runoff situations.
TI  - The luxS gene is involved in cell-cell signalling for toxin production in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen, Clostridium perfringens, causes clostridial myonecrosis or gas gangrene in humans by producing numerous extracellular toxins and enzymes that act in concert to degrade host tissues. C. perfringens possesses a homologue of the luxS gene that is reported to be responsible for the production of autoinducer 2 (AI-2), which participates in quorum sensing in bacteria. The luxS mutant was constructed using C. perfringens strain 13, and the role of the luxS gene in toxin production was examined. The cell-free culture supernatant from wild-type strain 13 greatly stimulated the luminescence of Vibrio harveyi BB170, whereas that from the luxS mutant caused no significant stimulation, indicating that the luxS gene is necessary for AI-2 production in C. perfringens. The luxS mutant showed a reduced level of production of alpha-, kappa- and theta-toxins. In the luxS mutant, the transcription of the theta-toxin gene (pfoA) was lower at mid-exponential growth phase, whereas alpha- and kappa-toxin gene transcription was not significantly affected. The production of toxins in the luxS mutant was stimulated by the addition of the culture supernatant from the wild-type cells, possibly because of the presence of AI-2. Moreover, the expression of the pfoA gene in the luxS mutant was apparently activated when the mutant cells were cultured in the presence of culture supernatants from the wild-type C. perfringens, Escherichia coli DH5alpha carrying the luxS gene of C. perfringens. A deletion analysis of the luxS operon showed that the luxS gene alone is responsible for cell-cell signalling, and that the metB or cysK genes located upstream of luxS are not involved in regulating toxin production. Our results indicate that cell-cell signalling by AI-2 plays an important role in the regulation of toxin production in C. perfringens.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat cooked foods from a centralized school kitchen in Argentina.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological and sensory quality as well as the safety of ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked foods prepared in and distributed from a centralized kitchen to schools in Argentina. A total of 101 cooked food samples delivered as hot RTE cooked foods (group A) and as RTE cooked foods at room temperature (group B) and 140 surface swab environment samples were collected from February to November 1999. Petrifilm plates were used for aerobic (PAC), coliform (PCC), and Escherichia coli (PEC) counts. Standard methods were used to determine Enterobacteriaceae (EntC) and thermotolerant coliform counts (TCC). Samples were also tested for the presence of Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens. Food temperatures just before samples were put into containers ranged from 80 to 98 degrees C and from 28 to 32 degrees C for group A and group B, respectively. For group A food samples, PAC ranged from 1.04 to 3.50 log CFU/g, and PCC, PEC, TCC, and EntC were not detected. For group B food samples, PAC ranged from 3.63 to 6.48 log CFU/g, PCC ranged from 1.90 to 5.36 log CFU/g, TCC ranged from 1.30 to 3.95 log CFU/g, and EntC ranged from 3.60 to 5.46 log CFU/g. Of the foodborne pathogens, only B. cereus was isolated (63.4% of samples) in both food groups (<4 log CFU/g). The microbiological and sensory quality and the safety of group A foods were satisfactory. Large numbers of PAC and EntC detected in group B foods show that better control is needed to avoid potential foodborne diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ayurvedic tablet "hadrabi".
AB  - The Ethanolic extract of "Hadrabi" powder was tested for antimicrobial activites  against gram positive organisms-Staphylococus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens and gram negative organisms-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi -B, Escherichia coli & Klebsiella pneumoniae Significant antimicrobial activity of the extract was found in this study at the dose of 1250 mg.
TI  - Selective responses of three Ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The selective responses of Ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides A and B, kaempferol, and quercetin. The components of G. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. At 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on Escherichia coli. At 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against C. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-O-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against C. perfringens and kaempferol 3-O-(2' '-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside against E. coli. No inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides A and B, kaempferol, or quercetin. Furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, B. adolescentis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Shima drinking water--a bacteriological analysis.
AB  - 300 water samples, 60 from piped supply and 240 from 20 natural sources were analyzed bacteriologically for four important bacterial indicators every month over a period of one year. The MPN of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis were detected by multiple tube method and Clostridium perfringens was isolated using litmus milk medium. From piped water supply, only one sample was found unfit for human consumption. The plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C varied from 0.5 x 10(3) to 15 x 10(3) per ml. of water. From natural sources, MPN indices for coliforms, Esch. coli and S. faecalis varied from 3 to > 1800, 0 to > 1800 and 0 to 540 per 100 ml. of water respectively. About 1/3rd of samples showed presence of Cl. perfringens. The plate count varied from 1.0 x 10(3) to > 150 x 10(3) per ml. of water. Salmonella typhi was isolated in 1.25% samples by membrane filtration technique. The water from all the natural sources was unfit for human consumption whereas piped water supply was of good quality in general.
TI  - Binding component of Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin induces endocytosis in Vero cells.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin is a binary toxin consisting of two individual proteins, the binding component (Ib) and the enzyme component (Ia). Wild-type Ib bound to Vero cells at 4 and 37 degrees C and formed oligomers at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. The Ib-induced K(+) release from the cells was dependent on the oligomer formation of Ib in the cells, but the oligomer formation did not induce rounding activity or cytotoxicity. After incubation of the cells with recombinant Ib (rIb) at 37 degrees C, the Ib oligomer in the cell became resistant to pronase treatment with time, but the Ib monomer was sensitive to the treatment. Furthermore, treatment of Vero cells with rIb in the presence of bafilomycin, methylamine, or ethylamine resulted in accumulation of the oligomer in the cells but had no effect on K(+) release. Moreover, incubation with Ib plus Ia in the presence of these agents caused no rounding in the cells. These observations suggest that Ib binds to Vero cells, itself oligomerizing to form ion-permeable channels and that the formation of oligomer then induces endocytosis.
TI  - Perfringolysin O expression in Clostridium perfringens is independent of the upstream pfoR gene.
AB  - The pathogenesis of Clostridium perfringens-mediated gas gangrene or clostridial  myonecrosis involves the extracellular toxins alpha-toxin and perfringolysin O. Previous studies (T. Shimizu, A. Okabe, J. Minami, and H. Hayashi, Infect. Immun. 59:137-142, 1991) carried out with Escherichia coli suggested that the perfringolysin O structural gene, pfoA, was positively regulated by the product of the upstream pfoR gene. In an attempt to confirm this hypothesis in C. perfringens, a pfoR-pfoA deletion mutant was complemented with isogenic pfoA(+) shuttle plasmids that varied only in their ability to encode an intact pfoR gene. No difference in the ability to produce perfringolysin O was observed for C. perfringens strains carrying these plasmids. In addition, chromosomal pfoR mutants were constructed by homologous recombination in C. perfringens. Again no difference in perfringolysin O activity was observed. Since it was not possible to alter perfringolysin O expression by mutation of pfoR, it was concluded that the pfoR gene product is unlikely to have a role in the regulation of pfoA expression in C. perfringens.
TI  - Bacterial indices of drinking water from natural sources.
AB  - Two hundred forty samples of water from twenty natural sources were subjected to  the study for the detection of four bacterial indicators of faecal pollution. The samples were subjected to the detection of coliform, faecal coliform, E. coli, S. faecalis, Cl. welchii and plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C. All these samples were found unfit for human consumption. MPN for coliforms, E. coli and S. faecalis varied from 3 to 1800 per 100 ml of water, sero to 1800 per 100 ml water and zero to 540 per 100 ml of water respectively. Plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C varied from 2.5 x 10(3) to > 150 x 10(3) per ml of water. Cl. welchii was detected in 30.4% samples in rainy season and high plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C was observed during the same period.
TI  - Influence of soil on fecal indicator organisms in a tidally influenced subtropical environment.
AB  - The potential regrowth of fecal indicator bacteria released into coastal environments in recreational water bodies has been of concern, especially in tropical and subtropical areas where the number of these bacteria can be artificially elevated beyond that from fecal impacts alone. The task of determining the factors that influence indicator bacterial regrowth was addressed though a series of field sampling and laboratory experiments using in situ densities of Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens in river water, sediment, and soil. Field sampling efforts included the collection of surface sediments along the cross section of a riverbank, a 20-cm-deep soil core, and additional surface soils from remote locations. In addition to field sampling, two types of laboratory experiments were conducted. The first experiment investigated the survival of bacteria already present in river water with the addition of sterile and unsterile sediment. The second experiment was designed to simulate the wetting and drying effects due to tidal cycles. The results from the sampling study found elevated numbers of E. coli and C. perfringens in surficial sediments along the riverbank near the edge of the water. C. perfringens was found in high numbers in the subsurface samples obtained from the soil core. Results from laboratory experiments revealed a significant amount of regrowth for enterococci and E. coli with the simulation of tides and addition of sterile sediment. Regrowth was not observed for C. perfringens. This study demonstrates the need to further evaluate the characteristics of indicator microbes within tropical and subtropical water systems where natural vegetation, soil embankments, and long-term sediment accumulation are present. In such areas, the use of traditional indicator microbes to regulate recreational uses of a water body may not be appropriate.
TI  - Identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (TRFPs): a rapid, PCR-based method.
AB  - Identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. We have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 16S rRNA gene fragment using a pair of universal PCR primers. The forward PCR primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-FAM) fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the PCR products after digestion with restriction enzymes. The PCR products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an automated DNA sequencer. The data was analysed with GeneScan software 2.1. Eleven bacteria (Eubacterium biforme, E. limosum, Peptostreptococcus productus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, C. perfringens and Escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. This protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.
TI  - Characterization of a novel endo-beta-galactosidase specific for releasing the disaccharide GlcNAc alpha 1-->4Gal from glycoconjugates.
AB  - In contrast to the beta-linked GlcNAc, the alpha-linked GlcNAc has not been commonly found in glycoconjugates. We have recently revealed the presence of an unusual endo-beta-galactosidase (Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa)) in Clostridium perfringens capable of releasing GlcNAcalpha1-->4Gal from glycans expressed in the gastric mucous cell-type mucin [Ashida, H., Anderson, K., Nakayama, J., Maskos, K., Chou, C.-W., Cole, R. B., Li, S.-C., and Li, Y.-T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 28226-28232]. To characterize Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa), we have cloned its gene, gngC, from the genomic DNA library prepared from C. perfringens ATCC10543. The gene encodes 420 amino acid residues including a 17-residue signal peptide at the N-terminus. Using pUC18, we were able to prepare 25 mg of the fully active and pure recombinant Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa) from 1 L of Escherichia coli DH5alpha culture, which was 170 times higher than that produced by the original clostridial strain. Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa) shares a low but significant sequence similarity with two other endo-beta-galactosidases (16-21% amino acid identity). It also shows some similarity with bacterial 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan 4-glucanohydrolases of the glycoside hydrolase family 16. Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa) was found to contain the EXDX(X)E sequence (Glu-168 to Glu-173), that has been identified as the catalytic motif of families 16 and 7 retaining glycoside hydrolases. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to show that Glu-168 and Glu-173 were essential for the Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa) activity. By NMR spectroscopy, Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa) was found to act as a retaining enzyme.
TI  - Removal of bacterial and viral faecal indicator organisms in a waste stabilization pond system in Choconta, Cundinamarca (Colombia).
AB  - A major objective for domestic wastewater treatment using waste stabilization pond systems is the removal of pathogenic microorganisms. Traditional evaluation parameters for faecal contamination are the total and faecal coliforms. However, epidemiological studies, environmental resistance and the behaviour in the treatment systems, show that viruses are an important disease agent and even more resistant to disinfection than bacteria. Therefore, it is important to introduce viruses as a faecal indicator and to compare them with the traditional bacterial indicators. A waste stabilization pond system was evaluated in the municipality of Choconta, Cundinamarca (Colombia), for the removal of faecal indicators (such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens) and viruses like F+, somatic and Bacteroides fragilis phages. The system includes two facultative ponds in series with a flow of 1555 m3/day. Samples were collected at the entrance of the system, in the two ponds and from the final effluent. Results show a decrease between 0.3 and 4.7 logarithmic units in the bacterial indicators and between 1 and 4.6 logarithmic units with viral indicators.
TI  - Adhesive property of Bifidobacterium lactis LKM512 and predominant bacteria of intestinal microflora to human intestinal mucin.
AB  - The adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of Bifidobacterium lactis LKM512, B. longum, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. Adhesive rate of LKM512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. Though the adhesive property of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. Adhesive inhibitory effect of C. perfringens to the mucin by LKM512 was examined. Under the condition that LKM512 was 108/ml and that C. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of C. perfringens to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when LKM512 adhered in advance. There was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when C. perfringens adhered to mucin in advance. Thus, LKM512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.
TI  - Epidemiologic profiling: evaluating foodborne outbreaks for which no pathogen was isolated by routine laboratory testing: United States, 1982-9.
AB  - The objective was to evaluate foodborne outbreaks of undetermined aetiology by comparing them to pathogen-specific epidemiologic profiles of laboratory-confirmed foodborne outbreaks. National foodborne outbreak data reported to CDC during 1982-9 were categorized by clinico-epidemiologic profiles based on incubation, duration, percent vomiting, fever and vomiting to fever ratio. From the pathogen-specific profiles, five syndromes were developed: a vomiting-toxin syndrome resembling Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus; a diarrhoea-toxin syndrome characteristic of Clostridium perfringens, a diarrhaeogenic Escherichia coli syndrome, a Norwalk-like virus syndrome, and a salmonella like syndrome. Of 712 outbreaks, 624 (87.6%) matched one of five syndromes; 340 (47.8%) matched the Norwalk-like syndrome and 83 (11.7%) matched the salmonella-like syndrome. After combining information on known pathogens and epidemiologic profiles, only 88 (12.4%) outbreaks remained unclassified. Norwalk-like virus outbreaks appear as common as salmonella-like outbreaks. We conclude that profiling can help classify outbreaks, guide investigations and direct laboratory testing to help detect new and emerging pathogens.

TI  - [Cloning and expression of ScFv gene against alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens type A].
AB  - The VH and VL genes from a hybridoma cell line producing mouse McAb against alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens type A were amplified by RT-PCR. The VH and VL genes were connected thought a flexible linker (Gly4Ser)3 and the VH-linker-VL (ScFv) gene was cloned into a vector pGEM-T. The ScFv gene consists of 726 bp encoding 242 amino acid residues. Both VH and VL genes were confirmed as functionally rearranged mouse immunoglobulin variable region. According to kabat classed method, the VH and VL gene segments belong to mouse Ig heavy chain subgroup II (B) and kappa light chain subgroup III respectively. The ScFv gene was amplified inserted the expression vector pHOG21 and transformed into E coli XL1-BLUE. The ScFv protein was highly expressed in recombinant strain XL1-BLUE (pHOG-2E3) and the expression level of the ScFv was about 25% of total bacteria protein by SDS-PAGE. The neutralization assay showed that the expressed ScFv protein could neutralize the phospholipase C activities of alpha-toxin.
TI  - The failure of oral tolerance induction is functionally coupled to the absence of T cells in Peyer's patches under germfree conditions.
AB  - Although intestinal bacterial flora has been thought to play a role in the induction of oral tolerance, the mechanism has yet to be elucidated. We therefore examined the bacterial flora-dependent acquisition of susceptibility to oral tolerance induction using a gnotobiotic murine model. Germ-free (GF) mice exhibited a significant shortage of T cells in the PPs in comparison to SPF mice. A recovery in the number of such T cells was accomplished in the gnotobiotic mice associated with Bifidobacterium infantis or Escherichia coli but not in the gnotobiotic mice with Clostridium perfringens or Staphylococcus aureus. To examine the susceptibility to oral tolerance induction, these mice were orally given ovalbumin (OVA) as a tolerogen and then injected i.p. with the Ag. The Ag-specific IgG1 in the serum remained at a low level in both SPF and those gnotobiotic mice groups containing a sufficient number of T cells in the PPs. However, no such unresponsiveness in the Ab response was observed in GF or the other gnotobiotic mice groups containing only a few T cells in the tissues. Adoptive cell transfer analysis clearly showed that a sufficient number of T cells in the PPs is required for the induction of oral tolerance. Furthermore, the reduced expression of SLC (secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine), which is responsible for T-cell migration to lymphoid organs, was observed in the PPs of GF mice, resulting in a shortage of T cells in the tissues. However, the reduced expression of SLC was restored even in the GF mice after conventionalization, thus suggesting that the failure of oral tolerance induction is functionally coupled to the innate absence of T cells under the GF condition.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - The sialate-pyruvate lyase from pig kidney. Elucidation of the primary structure  and expression of recombinant enzyme activity.
AB  - The first complete primary structure of a mammalian sialate-pyruvate lyase, namely of the enzyme from porcine kidney, was elucidated by a combination of different PCR techniques followed by sequencing of the resulting fragments. The primers used were either deduced from four porcine lyase peptides or from an alignment of human and mouse expressed sequence tags (ESTs), which were found to be homologous to already known microbial lyase sequences, and cDNA alone or after ligation with a plasmid vector served as a template. The lyase primary structure consists of 319 amino acids with a calculated protein molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa, which fits well to the value determined for the native enzyme. The porcine lyase sequence made it possible to assemble several ESTs from mouse and man in order to obtain the complete putative lyase genes. The three mammalian sequences reveal a high degree of homology both on the nucleotide (83% of the nucleotides are identical between all three sequences) and on the amino-acid level (72% of the amino acids are identical between all three sequences), and thus form a tightly related group. In contrast, the identity between the lyase primary structures from pig kidney and the microbial enzyme from Clostridium perfringens is much less pronounced (25%). Thirty-one amino acids were found to be absolutely conserved in all lyase sequences. Among them are two amino acids (lysine 173 and tyrosine 143 in the porcine lyase) that are most important for the catalytic reaction. After expression cloning, recombinant enzyme activity was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, which confirms the identity of the cloned sequence and verifies one of the putative human and murine sequences. After SDS/PAGE of a cell extract of the expression clone, a band of 35kDa was stained on the gel.
TI  - Monitoring coastal marine waters for spore-forming bacteria of faecal and soil origin to determine point from non-point source pollution.
AB  - The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the World Health Organization  (WHO) have established recreational water quality standards limiting the concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria (faecal coliform, E. coli, enterococci) to ensure that these waters are safe for swimming. In the application of these hygienic water quality standards, it is assumed that there are no significant environmental sources of these faecal indicator bacteria which are unrelated to direct faecal contamination. However, we previously reported that these faecal indicator bacteria are able to grow in the soil environment of humid tropical island environments such as Hawaii and Guam and are transported at high concentrations into streams and storm drains by rain. Thus, streams and storm drains in Hawaii contain consistently high concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria which routinely exceed the EPA and WHO recreational water quality standards. Since, streams and storm drains eventually flow out to coastal marine waters, we hypothesize that all the coastal beaches which receive run-off from streams and storm drains will contain elevated concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the coastal waters at four beaches known to receive water from stream or storm drains for salinity, turbidity, and used the two faecal indicator bacteria (E. coli, enterococci) to establish recreational water quality standards. To determine if these coastal waters are contaminated with non-point source pollution (streams) or with point source pollution (sewage effluent), these same water samples were also assayed for spore-forming bacteria of faecal origin (Cl. perfringens) and of soil origin (Bacillus species). Using this monitoring strategy it was possible to determine when coastal marine waters were contaminated with non-point source pollution and when coastal waters were contaminated with point source pollution. The results of this study are most likely applicable to all countries in the warm and humid region of the world.
TI  - Sanitary analysis of crude and composted activated sludge.
AB  - This paper presents a sanitary analysis of crude and composted activated sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plants in Slawa near Zielona G6ra in the period from September to December 1999. The composts were made from crude active sludge collected on 16.08.1999 with the addition of sawdust in a proportion of 15% with respect to dry sludge matter, and left in film bags with a capacity of 10 litres. Composting was carried out at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 8 weeks. Sanitary analysis of the activated sludge showed that the total quantity of bacteria, fungi, pathogenic bacteria and parasite ova was higher in the summer period compared to the spring period. The quantity of pathogenic bacteria and parasite eggs exceeded the permitted level in activated sludge designated for agricultural use. Analysis of the suitability of composts made from crude activated sludge showed that the quantity of pathogenic bacteria and parasite ova had been reduced, but was still higher than the permitted value for sewage sludge designated for agricultural use.
TI  - Evaluation of the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apheresis (Cobe Leucocyte Reduction System [LRS]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (Optipress) platelet concentrates (PCs) were tested. Six organisms were used for spiking the PCs: Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. On days 0, 2 and 5, BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: The BacT/Alert Automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. In general, as the inoculum concentration increased, the detection time decreased. Rapid growth was obtained with all organisms tested except for B. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. Bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) CFU/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) CFU/ml. Growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that PCs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. Rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. Leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. Bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.
TI  - The effects of mesenteric ischemia on ileal colonization, intestinal integrity, and bacterial translocation in newborn piglets.
AB  - The effects of mesenteric ischemia on ileal colonization, intestinal integrity, and bacterial translocation (BT) in newborn piglets were investigated in 362-day-old Pietrain piglets. Group I, controls were not operated upon; group II underwent a sham laparotomy; and group III underwent ligation of the mesenteric vessels in the distal ileum. After 3 days, the kidneys, spleens, livers, and ileal segments were harvested for microbial and histologic analyses. Two piglets in the ischemic group died; microscopic examination showed severe histologic lesions of the ischemic area. Escherichia coli counts were increased in the ischemic segment compared to the upper loop (P < 0.05). Ischemia favoured staphylococcal colonization, whereas in the sham group a drastic reduction of these organisms was observed (P < 0.005). BT to the kidneys, spleen, and liver occurred normally in the control group. Ischemia significantly increased the total microflora in the spleen and liver (P < 0.05) and furthered dissemination of Clostridium perfringens in the kidneys (P < 0.05); 50% of ischemic animals had proteolytic clostridia in this organ (P < 0.05). Moreover, the incidence of E. coli in the kidneys, spleen, and liver was significantly higher in the sham and ischemic groups than in the controls (P < 0.05). Ileal ischemia thus induced significant histologic lesions, and surgery rather than gut microflora controls translocation.
TI  - Heat treatment adaptations in Clostridium perfringens vegetative cells.
AB  - Vegetative cells of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxigenic strains NCTC 8679, NCTC 8238. and H6 were grown at 37 degrees C followed by a 60-min exposure to 28 degrees C or 46 degrees C. D10-values, as a measure of thermal resistance at 60 degrees C, were significantly lower for 28 degrees C exposures as compared with cultures given 37 and 46 degrees C exposures. Following refrigeration at 4 degrees C for 24 h, D10-values for the 37 and 46 degrees C samples could not be differentiated from 28 degrees C samples. Western immunoblot analyses of lysates from heat-adapted cells also detected the increased expression of proteins reacting with antiserum directed against the molecular chaperonins from Escherichia coli; GroEL, DnaJ, and the small acid soluble protein from Bacillus subtilis, SspC. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) identified thermal transitions corresponding to ribosomal protein denaturations at 72.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Any cellular heat adaptations in the DSC profiles were lost following refrigeration for several days to simulate minimally processed food storage conditions. Further analyses of high-speed pellets from crude cell extract fractions using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis detected the differential gene expression of at least four major proteins in heat-adapted vegetative cells of C. perfringens. N-terminal amino acid analyses identified two of the proteins as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and rubrerythrin. Both appear to have roles in this anaerobe under stressful conditions.
TI  - Selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from Pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  - Among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of Pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an impregnated paper disk method. The biologically active components of P. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. The activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. Two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against Escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. Weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in C. perfringens and E. coli as compared to B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. fragilis, B. longum, or L. acidophilus. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of P. cernua root.

AB  
TI  - Characterization of the enzymatic component of the ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDTa from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Certain strains of Clostridium difficile produce the ADP-ribosyltransferase CDT,  which is a binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxin. The toxin consists of the binding component CDTb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component CDTa. Here we studied the enzyme component (CDTa) of the toxin using the binding component of Clostridium perfringens iota toxin (Ib), which is interchangeable with CDTb as a transport component. Ib was used because CDTb was not expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Similar to iota toxin, CDTa ADP-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. The N-terminal part of CDTa (CDTa1-240) competes with full-length CDTa for binding to the iota toxin binding component. The C-terminal part (CDTa244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length CDTa. Changes of Glu428 and Glu430 to glutamine, Ser388 to alanine, and Arg345 to lysine blocked ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Comparison of CDTa with C. perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment Ia208-413 but loss of activity of several N-terminally deleted C2I proteins including C2I103-431, C2I190-431, and C2I30-431. The data indicate that CDTa belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. It shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and C2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in NAD-binding and/or catalytic activity. The enzyme components of CDT, iota toxin, and C2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.
TI  - Expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. This process is attributed to enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The presence of Clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56 intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured Clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. Such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. METHODS: A total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. Of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. These 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-D glucuronide as substrate. Results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. RESULTS: C. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for E coli, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus sp., and Klebsiella sp. CONCLUSION: C. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than E coli and Klebsiella sp.
TI  - Bacterial Cholangitis.
AB  - The treatment of acute bacterial cholangitis requires broad-spectrum antibiotics  to cover against gram-negative aerobic enteric organisms (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species), gram-positive Enterococcus and anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens). Approximately 20% of patients with acute cholangitis fail to respond to conservative treatment with antibiotic therapy and require urgent biliary decompression, which is the mainstay of therapy. This is best accomplished by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and placement of a nasobiliary drainage tube or a large bore (10 F or larger) indwelling plastic stent. Alternative therapy includes percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or surgical biliary decompression, but these carry a significantly higher morbidity and mortality. Supportive care includes intravenous fluid hydration to prevent renal failure and close monitoring of vital signs for determination of potential septicemia.
TI  - Clostridium bacteremia: emphasis on the poor prognosis in cirrhotic patients.
AB  - Bacteremic episodes caused by anaerobes are unusual and the clinical importance of Clostridium bacteremia remains unclear. This retrospective case study examined the risk factors among a group of patients who developed Clostridium bacteremia. Medical records from 73 episodes of clostridial bacteremia in 73 patients treated in a medical center during an 11-year period were reviewed. Of all episodes, 96% were community-acquired. Twelve percent of patients had polymicrobial bacteremia, with Escherichia coli being the most common accompanying bacterium. Diabetes mellitus (26%) and liver cirrhosis (25%) were the most common underlying diseases. The most common etiological organisms were Clostridium perfringens (77%), Clostridium bifermentans (9%), and Clostridium septicum (4%). Only one patient with C. septicum bacteremia had a histocytotoxic infection, which was a fatal gas gangrene. Univariate analysis of data from patients with monomicrobial Clostridium bacteremia revealed that younger age (age < 65 years), underlying liver cirrhosis, and presence of septic shock at initial presentation were associated with fatality; but only the latter two variables were independently associated with fatality in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for monomicrobial Clostridium bacteremia did not significantly affect clinical outcomes, which might suggest that Clostridium species in the bloodstream can be regarded as merely contaminants or transient bacteremia. This suggestion was not supported by the finding that seven of 13 cirrhotic patients with monomicrobial Clostridium bacteremia died of sepsis, of whom six had not receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the clinical importance of Clostridium bacteremia should be interpreted with caution because of its high risk of mortality in susceptible hosts, particularly cirrhotic patients, who do not receive appropriate therapy timely.
TI  - Characterization and mutagenesis of the recombinant N-acetylneuraminate lyase from Clostridium perfringens: insights into the reaction mechanism.
AB  - The N-acetylneuraminate lyase from Clostridium perfringens was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with a His-tag and purified to homogeneity using metal chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.6 and a temperature optimum of 65-70 degrees C. In kinetic studies the lyase exhibits a Km of 3.2 mM for Neu5Ac and a Vmax of 27.5 U x mg(-1). To clarify the functional role of some putative active site residues, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. Lysine 161 was identified as the residue forming the Schiff base intermediate with the substrate. Tyrosine 133 was shown to be also a catalytically important residue; it seems to function as an acceptor for the proton of the C4 hydroxyl group, as already suggested by other groups. Furthermore, it is involved in stabilizing the Schiff base intermediate. Mutations of aspartate 187 and glutamate 188 indicate that both residues are involved in substrate binding. In this respect the carboxy group of aspartate 187 seems to be particularly important. Based on the results of these studies, a model of the reaction mechanism is discussed.
TI  - Molecular evidence that the capacity for endosporulation is universal among phototrophic heliobacteria.
AB  - Although enrichment cultures for anoxygenic phototrophic heliobacteria commonly contain sporulating cells, once strains of heliobacteria are obtained in pure culture, they all but cease to sporulate. In fact, some species of heliobacteria have never been observed to sporulate. Thus, despite their phylogenetic connection to endospore-forming bacteria, the question of sporulation capacity in heliobacteria remains open. We have investigated this problem using PCR and Southern hybridization as tools and show here that all recognized species of heliobacteria tested, as well as several unclassified strains, contain homologs to the ssp genes of Clostridium and Bacillus species, genes that encode key sporulation-specific proteins. It can therefore be concluded that as a group, heliobacteria are likely all to be endospore-forming bacteria in agreement with their phylogenetic placement within the 'low GC' Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Intestinal epithelial damage in sids babies and its similarity to that caused by  bacterial toxins in the rabbit.
AB  - Sections of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine from 14 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) babies were examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The type and amount of damage was characterised and quantitated and compared with the presence of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in faecal samples from the babies and toxins from the bacteria in faecal samples and serum from the babies. The data were compared with the damage that these toxins cause to the rabbit intestinal epithelium (see the previous paper in this issue). Damage was present in most of the SIDS samples, varying from 0 to 96%, and most damage occurred when the faecal samples contained the above bacteria and their toxins. Damage varied from removal of microvilli, damage to villus tips, separation of and removal of epithelial cells from the lamina propria, and removal of enterocytes leaving goblet and tuft cells, to damage and breakdown of the lamina propria. The results support the hypothesis that the cause of death in a significant proportion of SIDS babies may result from the absorption of toxins from the intestinal tract initiating a toxic shock reaction.
TI  - The effect of bacterial enterotoxins implicated in SIDS on the rabbit intestine.
AB  - The aim of this project was to characterise the type of damage caused to the intestine of the infant rabbit by bacterial enterotoxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Samples of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine exposed to the toxins for up to 6 hours were examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The damage was quantitatively assessed (% villi damaged) by SEM and qualitatively by SEM and TEM. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B and Clostridium difficile toxin A + toxin B combined all caused severe damage to the villi in the small intestine (80-90% damage). Clostridium difficile toxin B caused only slight damage (17% to the jejunum, 26% to the caecum). Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin caused moderate damage to the small intestine (duodenum 34%, caecum 35%), and Escherichia coli STa caused significant damage to the small (53-70%) and large intestine (51%). The level of toxin damage increased with time, the small intestine being more susceptible generally to damage than the large intestine. Each toxin differed in its ability to damage the villi, microvilli, enterocytes and lamina propria.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Removal of indicator bacteria, human enteric viruses, Giardia cysts, and Cryptosporidium oocysts at a large wastewater primary treatment facility.
AB  - Pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria occurrence and removal were studied for a  period of 6 months at the Montreal Urban Community wastewater treatment facility. With a capacity of about 7.6 million cubic metres per day (two billion U.S. gallons per day), it is the largest primary physico-chemical treatment plant in America. The plant discharges a nondisinfected effluent containing about 20 mg/L of suspended matter and 0.5 mg/L of total phosphorus on the basis of average annual concentrations. BDO5 (annual mean) is 75 mg/L before treatment and 32 mg/L after treatment. Samples were collected for a period of 6 months, and they demonstrated that the plant was not efficient at removing indicator bacteria and the pathogens tested. Fecal coliforms were the most numerous of the indicator bacteria and their removal averaged 25%. Fecal streptococci removal was 29%, while Escherichia coli removal was 12%. In untreated sewage, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and human enteric viruses were more numerous in summer and early autumn. Fecal streptococci counts remained relatively similar throughout the period. Clostridium perfringens removal averaged 51%. Giardia cysts levels were not markedly different throughout the study period, and 76% of the cysts were removed by treatment. Cryptosporidium oocyst counts were erratic, probably due to the methods, and removal was 27%. Human enteric viruses were detected in all samples of raw and treated wastewater with no removal observed (0%). Overall, the plant did not perform well for the removal of fecal indicator bacteria, human enteric viruses, or parasite cysts. Supplementary treatment and disinfection were recommended to protect public health. Various alternatives are being evaluated.
TI  - A survey of ethnic foods for microbial quality and aflatoxin content.
AB  - A range of ethnic foods was examined for their microbiological content in relation to total viable counts (TVC) of aerobic bacteria, counts of presumptive coliforms, yeast and mould counts; presence of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter spp.; total enumeration of Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus spp.; identification of moulds and the presence of total aflatoxins. Samples, which included cereals, nuts, dried fruits, herbs and spices, were obtained from local retail outlets and distributors. It was established that three samples of pistachio nuts contained significant levels of aflatoxins. The concentration of total aflatoxins in these three nut samples ranged from 15 to 259 microg/kg of sample. Only two other samples contained trace amounts of aflatoxins, all other samples analysed were found to be free of any detectable level of aflatoxins. TVCs, coliform counts and yeast and mould counts varied widely depending on the matrix tested. Generally, rice, wheat and peanuts produced low counts whereas other nuts, gram flour and spices produced much higher counts. Cl. perfringens, Staph. aureus, and Bacillus spp. were common in spices, nuts and gram flour, however, Listeria monocytogenes was only detected in four samples and in no sample could Salmonella spp, E. coli O157:H7 or Campylobacter spp. be detected.
TI  - Cleavage of a C-terminal peptide is essential for heptamerization of Clostridium  perfringens epsilon-toxin in the synaptosomal membrane.
AB  - Activation of Clostridium perfringens epsilon-protoxin by tryptic digestion is accompanied by removal of the 13 N-terminal and 22 C-terminal amino acid residues. In this study, we examined the toxicity of four constructs: an epsilon-protoxin derivative (PD), in which a factor Xa cleavage site was generated at the C-terminal trypsin-sensitive site; PD without the 13 N-terminal residues (DeltaN-PD); PD without the 23 C-terminal residues (DeltaC-PD); and PD without either the N- or C-terminal residues (DeltaNC-PD). A mouse lethality test showed that DeltaN-PD was inactive, as is PD, whereas DeltaC-PD and DeltaNC-PD were equally active. DeltaC-PD and DeltaNC-PD, but not the other constructs formed a large SDS-resistant complex in rat synaptosomal membranes as demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When DeltaNC-PD and DeltaC-PD, both labeled with (32)P and mixed in various ratios, were incubated with membranes, eight distinct high molecular weight bands corresponding to six heteropolymers and two homopolymers were detected on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, indicating the active toxin forms a heptameric complex. These results indicate that C-terminal processing is responsible for activation of the toxin and that it is essential for its heptamerization within the membrane.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of milk lipids.
AB  - The bactericidal capacity of digestion products of bovine milk triglycerides and  membrane lipids was tested in vitro using Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Clostridium perfringens. C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acids and digestion products of sphingolipids appeared to be effective bactericidal agents, whereas digestion products of phosphoglycerides were moderately bactericidal. Thus, milk fat sphingolipids and triglycerides, particularly those containing C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acids, may protect against food-borne gastroenteritis.
TI  - Improved agar diffusion method for detecting residual antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The improved agar diffusion method for determination of residual antimicrobial agents was investigated, and the sensitivities of various combinations of test organisms and assay media were determined using 7 organisms, 5 media, and 31 antimicrobial agents. Bacillus stearothermophilus and synthetic assay medium (SAM) showed the greatest sensitivity for screening penicillins (penicillin G and ampicillin). The combination of Bacillus subtilis and minimum medium (MM) was the most sensitive for tetracyclines (oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline), B. stearothermophilus and SAM or Micrococcus luteus and Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) for detecting tylosin and erythromycin, B. subtilis and MHA for aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin), B. stearothermophilus and SAM for polyethers (salinomycin and lasalocid), and B. subtilis and MM or Clostridium perfringens and GAM for polypeptides (thiopeptin, enramycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin). However, gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli ATCC 27166 and MM were better for screening for colistin and polymixin-B. For detecting the synthetic drugs tested, the best combination was B. subtilis and MM for sulfonamides, E. coli 27166 and MM for quinolones (oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid), B. subtilis and MM for furans (furazolidone), and the bioluminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum and luminescence assay medium for chloramphenicol and oxolinic acid. The results showed that the use of four assay plates, B. stearothermophilus and SAM, B. subtilis and MM, M. luteus and MHA, and E. coli 27166 and MM, was superior to the currently available techniques for screening for residual antimicrobial agents in edible animal tissues.
TI  - Weaning of piglets. Effects of an exposure to a pathogenic strain of Escherichia  coli.
AB  - The influence of weaning on day 32 and a simultaneous challenge with a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli was studied in eight piglets. Another nine weaned but non-infected piglets were used as controls. The distribution of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) into subpopulations, as well as their response when stimulated in vitro by pokeweed mitogen, changed in a similar manner during post-weaning in both groups. In contrast, superior responses were recorded for PBMC collected from the challenged pigs when stimulated in vitro with concanavalin A and with a heat-inactivated extract of the E. coli strain used for infection, respectively. Despite a successful colonization of the challenge strain, no clinical signs of disease were recorded. Nor did the daily weight gain or the number of E. coli, enterococci, or Clostridium perfringens excreted per gram of faeces differ between the groups. However, the weaning induced a marked decrease in the diversity of coliforms in individual piglets, which announced a reduced colonization resistance of that flora. Also, a decreased homogeneity between coliform floras of different piglets was observed following weaning. The decreased homogeneity indicated that different strains of E. coli were predominant in different animals, which may in turn facilitate the spread of pathogenic strains. The enteric changes were more pronounced and lasted longer in infected animals. Still, the influence of a sole pathogenic strain of E. coli was not enough to induce post-weaning diarrhoea.
TI  - In vitro fermentation characteristics of native and processed cereal grains and potato starch using ileal chyme from dogs.
AB  - Two in vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the ability of small intestinal bacteria of dogs to ferment native and extruded cereal grains and potato starch and cereal grain and potato flours. Substrates included barley, corn, potato, rice, sorghum, and wheat. In addition to testing native grains and flours, extruded substrates also were tested. Substrates were extruded at low temperatures (LT; 79 to 93 degrees C) and high temperatures (HT; 124 to 140 degrees C) using a Wenger extruder (model TX-52). Substrates varied widely in concentrations of rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS), resistant starch (RS), and total starch (TS). Extrusion of most substrates at HT vs LT resulted in increased RDS and decreased RS concentrations. Organic matter disappearance (OMD) values attributed to microbial fermentation for a 5-h period were as high as 27% for native extruded substrates (LT potato starch) and 39% for potato flour. Average OMD was higher for cereal and potato flours than for native extruded substrates (29.9 vs 25.4%). Average molar percentages of short-chain fatty acids produced from all substrates fermented for 5 h were 73, 14, and 13% (acetate, propionate, and butyrate, respectively). Average lactate production for substrates ranked as follows: flours > native and extruded cereal grains and potato starch (0.33 and 0.18 mmol/g OM, respectively). In vitro microbial fermentation of starches by ileal bacteria can be substantial and is affected by differences in starch source, fraction, and processed form.
TI  - Spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  - This short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. As a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. Molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. For example, for Salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of S. typhimurium DT104 in 1998. The high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. The resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.
TI  - Early attachment of anaerobic bacteria may play an important role in biliary stent blockage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In vitro studies have demonstrated that ciprofloxacin suppresses Escherichia coli attachment on stents, and ciprofloxacin has been shown to prolong stent patency in cats. However, clinical studies with antibiotic prophylaxis have produced conflicting results. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify the bacteria that attach early on unblocked stents removed from patients and to study their enzyme activities. METHODS: Eighteen unblocked biliary stents were removed from 17 patients (benign obstruction in 14 and malignant obstruction in 4). All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis (mean of 6 days). Stents were in place for a mean of 33 days. The inside of stents was scraped and sludge was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Identification of isolated bacteria and measurement of beta-glucuronidase and phospholipase C activities were performed by using standard techniques. Gastric and duodenal juice from 18 patients with no biliary diseases was used as control samples. RESULTS: All stents were patent and only 6 had visible sludge. There were 19 anaerobes isolated from 16 stents (Clostridium perfringens 13, Clostridium bifermentans 4 and Bacteroides fragilis 2). Phospholipase C was detected in all Clostridium species. beta-Glucuronidase was produced only by 12 of 13 C perfringens isolates. Sixteen aerobes including Enterococcus species and Bacillus species were isolated but none produced beta-glucuronidase or phospholipase C. There were no aerobic gram-negative bacteria isolated from stents. Clostridium species and B fragilis were not recovered from the control samples. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had received antibiotic prophylaxis against gram-negative bacterial infection, anaerobic bacteria may play a role in initiating stent blockage.
TI  - Bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  - Numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. The clostridial binary toxins (Iota and C2 families) ADP-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. The large clostridial toxins from Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the Rho family that regulate actin polymerization. In contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from Escherichia coli activates Rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. The enterotoxin of Bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for E-cadherin and it promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The bacterial toxins that modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.
TI  - Gene transfer to Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319.
AB  - Although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. To remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319. Firstly, transfer of Tn1545 has been obtained using an Enterococcus faecalis donor. Secondly, IncP-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from Escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. The yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic C. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. A restriction endonuclease was detected in crude extracts of C. cellulolyticum. This enzyme, named CCE:I, is an isoschizomer of MSP:I (HPA:II). Electro-transformation was employed to establish plasmids containing the replication functions of pAMss1 (En. faecalis), pIM13 (Bacillus subtilis), pCB102 (Clostridium butyricum), pIP404 (Clostridium perfringens) and pWV01 (Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in C. cellulolyticum. Transformants were only obtained if the DNA was appropriately methylated on the external C of the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' using either BSU:FI methylase in vivo or MSP:I methylase in vitro. Plasmids based on the pAMss1 and pIM13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pCB102 replicon. Selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg DNA) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. Selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg DNA). The methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
TI  - Microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. For each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. Dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform counts and spore counts. Six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. The incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was also determined. In most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. In addition, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. Mean bacterial counts of water and swab samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.The predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Alcaligenes spp. Bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, Clostridium perfringens in 1%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3% and Vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were not detected. Non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.
TI  - Transposition of Tn4451 and Tn4453 involves a circular intermediate that forms a  promoter for the large resolvase, TnpX.
AB  - Tn4451 is the paradigm element of a family of mobilizable chloramphenicol resistance transposons from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile. The unique feature of these 6.3 kb elements is that their excision to form a circular molecule is mediated by TnpX, a member of the large resolvase family of site-specific recombinases. By optimizing the transposition assay system in Escherichia coli, we showed that Tn4453a from C. difficile transposed at a higher frequency than the C. perfringens element, Tn4451, and that transposition of both Tn4451 and Tn4453a was significantly enhanced by the provision of a multicopy tnpX gene in trans. The complete nucleotide sequence of Tn4453a was determined, but its comparison with Tn4451 did not reveal why it transposed at a higher frequency. Using experiments involving a chromosomal derivative of Tn4453a, we have confirmed that the circular form is the transposition intermediate. As the tnpX gene is located very close to one end of these elements, primer extension analysis was used to determine the transcription start point. The results showed that the formation of the circular intermediate creates a strong tnpX promoter, which consists of a -10 box originally located at the left end of the transposon and a -35 box originally located at the right end. The data provide strong evidence that transcription of tnpX is likely to occur from the non-replicating circular intermediate, which would facilitate the subsequent insertion of the transient circular molecule. It is postulated that, when the transposon is in an integrated state, transcription of tnpX would depend on the presence of an appropriately spaced -35 sequence in the DNA flanking the insertion site or the presence of an alternative upstream promoter.
TI  - Molecular analysis of tetracycline resistance in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars Typhimurium, enteritidis, Dublin, Choleraesuis, Hadar and Saintpaul: construction and application of specific gene probes.
AB  - A total of 65 epidemiologically unrelated tetracycline-resistant isolates of the  six Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (Salm.) serovars Dublin, Choleraesuis, Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Hadar and Saintpaul were investigated for the presence of tetracycline resistance genes. For this, specific gene probes of the tetracycline resistance genes (tet) of the hybridization classes A, B, C, D, E and G were constructed by cloning PCR-amplified internal segments of the respective tet structural genes. These gene probes were sequenced and used in hybridization experiments with plasmid DNA or endonuclease digested whole cell DNA as targets. Only tet(A) genes were detected on plasmids in all Salm. Dublin isolates as well as in single isolates of Salm. Choleraesuis and Salm. Typhimurium. Genes of the hybridization classes B, C, D and G, but also in some cases those of class A, were located in the chromosomal DNA of the corresponding Salmonella isolates. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of tet gene carrying fragments were detected in chromosomally tetracycline-resistant isolates. These RFLPs might represent valuable additional tools for the identification and characterization of tetracycline-resistant Salmonella isolates.
TI  - [Nutritional and microbiological profile of soybean sausages available in Costa Rica].
AB  - The nutritional and microbiological quality of 80 soybean sausage samples (50% frankfurter and 50% sausage mortadela) was studied. On average, the protein content was 17.5 g/100 g in sausage mortadela and 20 g/100 g in frankfurter. The mean total fat content was 5.5 g/100 g for both products. However when products of different manufacture industries were compared, a highly significant difference (p = 0.0000) in the fatty acids speciation between both groups and between samples of the same product were found. Bigger differences were found in the content of palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2). Cholesterol was not detected in samples analyzed. On average the atherogenicity index was 0.55 for sausage mortadela and 0.59 for frankfurter. A consumption of 25 grams of of soybean protein from these sausages can bring an intake of saturated fatty acids between 20-90% of the daily recommendation. Likewise, they can supply between 12-70% of the recommended daily polyunsaturated fatty acids. These variations are owing to the big difference in fatty acids speciation in each sausage brand. Around 20% of soybean sausages studied showed total coliform levels above 10(4)/g, being more frequent in sausage mortadela. Also 60% of this product and 10% of frankfurters showed psychrotroph levels of 10(6)/g. Clostridium perfringens, in levels above 10(2)/g was evidenciated in 5% of samples, Escherichia coli was not isolated from them. The findings of this study suggest the urgent need for implementing a quality control system for soybean sausages, before national health authorities consider to support nutritional campainings that promote their consumption.
TI  - [Detection of toxin-producing pathogenic bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of pathogenic Clostridium  botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli. With this aim in view, primers to botulinic toxins types A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G, perfringens enterotoxin, difficile toxin, and types 1 and 2 Shigella-like toxins were chosen and synthesized. Optimal amplification conditions were selected for each pair of primers, with DNA and the respective agent as the reaction mixture matrices. PCR was highly specific and sensitive in all cases. Its sensitivity was 10-100 cells/sample. Among the tested C. botulinum, C. perfringens, C. difficile, and E. coli strains, specific amplification products of expected size were observed only in the strains containing the respective toxin genes. These findings recommend the use of these methods in clinical microbiology. Strains containing type 2 Shigella-like toxin gene were detected among E. coli strains isolated from patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome, which for the first time indicates that the problem with E. coli epidemic strain O157 is valid for Russia. As a result of our studies, test systems for detection of types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G C. botulinum strains, C. perfringens and C. difficile, and E. coli O157 strains are now available.
TI  - New developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media.
AB  - This review describes some recent developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media in microbiological diagnostic. The detection of beta-D-glucuronidase (GUD) activity for enumeration of Escherichia coli is well known. E. coli O157:H7 strains are usually GUD-negative and do not ferment sorbitol. These characteristics are used in selective media for these organisms and new chromogenic media are available. Some of the new chromogenic media make the Salmonella diagnostic easier and faster. The use of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for detection of beta-D-glucosidase (beta-GLU) activity to differentiate enterococci has received considerable attention and new media are described. Rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus are other application of enzyme detection methods in food and water microbiology.
TI  - Influence of sodium chloride on the beta-glucuronidase activity of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli.
AB  - While the beta-glucuronidase activity of intact cells of Clostridium perfringens  was higher in 0.95% sodium chloride (NaCl) than that in 0, 0.1 or 0.5%, that of Escherichia coli was higher in 0.1% NaCl than that in 0, 0.5 or 0.95% NaCl in 0.1 mol l-1 KH2PO4. However, the enzyme activity of both species of intact cells was higher in buffer containing 16 mEq sodium, 134 mEq potassium and 16 mEq chloride per litre than in that containing 146 mEq sodium, 13 mEq potassium and 146 mEq chloride. These findings suggest that bacterial cells are affected by the presence of NaCl and that the effect of NaCl on the activity of bacterial beta-glucuronidase may differ by location in the large intestine.
TI  - Structural basis of polyamine-DNA recognition: spermidine and spermine interactions with genomic B-DNAs of different GC content probed by Raman spectroscopy.
AB  - Four genomic DNAs of differing GC content (Micrococcus luteus, 72% GC; Escherichia coli, 50% GC; calf thymus, 42% GC; Clostridium perfringens, 27% GC) have been employed as targets of interaction by the cationic polyamines spermidine ([H(3)N(CH(2))(3)NH(2)(CH(2))(4)NH(3)](3+)) and spermine ([(CH(2))(4)(NH(2)(CH(2))(3)NH(3))(2)](4+)). In solutions containing 60 mM DNA phosphate (approximately 20 mg DNA/ml) and either 1, 5 or 60 mM polyamine, only Raman bands associated with the phosphates exhibit large spectral changes, demonstrating that B-DNA phosphates are the primary targets of interaction. Phosphate perturbations, which are independent of base composition, are consistent with a model of non-specific cation binding in which delocalized polyamines diffuse along DNA while confined by the strong electrostatic potential gradient perpendicular to the helix axis. This finding provides experimental support for models in which polyamine-induced DNA condensation is driven by non-specific electrostatic binding. The Raman spectra also demonstrate that major groove sites (guanine N7 and thymine C5H(3)) are less affected than phosphates by polyamine-DNA interactions. Modest dependence of polyamine binding on genome base composition suggests that sequence context plays only a secondary role in recognition. Importantly, the results demonstrate that polyamine binding has a negligible effect on the native B-form secondary structure. The capability of spermidine or spermine to bind and condense genomic B-DNA without disrupting the native structure must be taken into account when considering DNA organization within bacterial nucleoids or cell nuclei.
TI  - Identification of two genes encoding putative new members of the ECF subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - Two genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 were identified which are predicted to encode new members of the ECF subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors. The sigX gene has the potential to encode a 184-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 21,870 Da and with the highest overall similarity to Fecl of Escherichia coli (27 % identical residues). The second gene, which is predicted to encode an alternative sigma factor of the ECF subfamily, is the previously described orf2 gene (Gerischer and Durre, 1990) located in the adc gene region of C. acetobutylicum. The deduced protein of orf2 has significant similarity to SigX of C. acetobutylicum (22 % identical residues) and shares structural features with other alternative sigma factors. Therefore, it is proposed to rename orf2 as sigY. Analysis of the phylogenetic relationship revealed that SigX from C. acetobutylicum, together with sigmaE from Streptomyces coelicolor and SigX from Bacillus subtilis, form a gram-positive cluster within the ECF subfamily and that SigY from C. acetobutylicum together with UviA from Clostridium perfringens, form a separate cluster located between the gram-positive cluster and the sporulation sigma factor sigmaH from B. subtilis.
TI  - Cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris against Clostridium spp.
AB  - The growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris Link. Pt. (Ascomycotina: Clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of Coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. The biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. This compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward Clostridium paraputrificum and Clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and Escherichia coli. However, C. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of C. militaris. As a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
TI  - Molecular cloning of endo-beta -galactosidase C and its application in removing alpha -galactosyl xenoantigen from blood vessels in the pig kidney.
AB  - Galalpha1-3Gal is the major xenoantigenic epitope responsible for hyperacute rejection upon pig to human xenotransplantation. Endo-beta-galactosidase C from Clostridium perfringens destroys the antigenic epitope by cleaving the beta-galactosidic linkage in the Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc structure. Based on partial peptide sequences of the enzyme, we molecularly cloned the enzyme gene, which encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of about 93 kDa. The deduced protein sequence of the enzyme has limited homology in the C-terminal half with endo-beta-galactosidase from Flavobacterium keratolyticus and beta-1,3-glucanases. The enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli removed the alpha-galactosyl epitope nearly completely from pig erythrocytes and from pig aortic endothelial cells. The enzyme-treated endothelial cells in culture were greatly reduced in cell surface antigens, which were recognized by IgM, IgG, or IgA in human sera, and became much less susceptible to complement-mediated cytotoxicity caused by human sera. When the pig kidney was perfused with the enzyme, the vascular endothelial cells became virtually devoid of the alpha-galactosyl epitope, with concomitant decrease in binding to IgM in human plasma. These results demonstrated that the recombinant endo-beta-galactosidase C is a valuable aid in xenotransplantation.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of KwaZulu natal snake venoms.
AB  - The objective was to ascertain whether local snake venoms have antibacterial properties. The venoms of the common night adder (Causus rhombeatus), gaboon adder (Bitis gabonica), puff adder (Bitis arietans), black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis), eastern green mamba (Dendroaspis augusticeps), forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca), snouted cobra (Naja annulifera) and Mozambique spitting cobra (Naja mossambica) were collected and, by gel diffusion, tested against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeriginosa, Bacteriodes fragilis, Bacteroides intermedius, Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium perfringens. All snake venoms showed antibacterial activity, with the adders showing most activity against the aerobes while the cobras showed lesser, but equal activity against the aerobes and anaerobes. Black mamba venom only showed activity against C. perfringens. In conclusion, local snake venoms have antibacterial properties which are dependent on the venom and bacterial type; and in the Naja spp., for anaerobic bacteria, diminish in winter. There is liable to be more than one toxin component responsible.
TI  - Microbiological examination of cold ready-to-eat sliced meats from catering establishments in the United Kingdom.
AB  - A microbiological study of cold, ready-to-eat sliced meats from 2579 catering establishments (public houses, hotels, cafes, restaurants, residential homes and other catering premises) found that 2587 of 3494 samples (74%) were of acceptable quality, 892 (26%) were of unsatisfactory quality and 15 (<1%) were of unacceptable quality. Unacceptable results were due to high levels of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria species and/or Clostridium perfringens. Unsatisfactory results were mostly due to high Aerobic Plate Counts. The microbiological quality of cold, ready-to-eat meats was associated with meat type, premises type, management training, hygienic practices, meat supplier and length of storage. The relationship between food hygiene training and microbiological quality is discussed.
TI  - Selective accumulation may account for shellfish-associated viral illness.
AB  - From 1991 through 1998, 1,266 cases of shellfish-related illnesses were attributed to Norwalk-like viruses. Seventy-eight percent of these illnesses occurred following consumption of oysters harvested from the Gulf Coast during the months of November through January. This study investigated the ability of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) to accumulate indicator microorganisms (i.e., fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and F(+) coliphage) from estuarine water. One-week trials over a 1-year period were used to determine if these indicator organisms could provide insight into the seasonal occurrence of these gastrointestinal illnesses. The results demonstrate that oysters preferentially accumulated F(+) coliphage, an enteric viral surrogate, to their greatest levels from late November through January, with a concentration factor of up to 99-fold. However, similar increases in accumulation of the other indicator microorganisms were not observed. These findings suggest that the seasonal occurrence of shellfish-related illnesses by enteric viruses is, in part, the result of seasonal physiological changes undergone by the oysters that affect their ability to accumulate viral particles from estuarine waters.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Diagnosis of neonatal pig diarrhea.
AB  - To be effective, swine practitioners should develop a unit health program. Development should involve unit managers, owners, and employees involved in day-to-day operations. Emphasis on training personnel and management to reduce disease and collection of accurate records is necessary. Routine diagnostics are needed to solve disease problems. Communication with laboratory personnel to ascertain what samples are needed for diagnosis of particular problems cannot be overemphasized. General diagnosis of disease problems outlined by Vinson can be similarly followed within the specifics of diarrheal problems within units. 1. Observe symptoms exhibited by pigs, i.e., huddling, fecal material around perineum, extreme thirst, etc. 2. Evaluate the degree of morbidity and potential production losses. 3. Analyze possible specific causes of symptoms, i.e., environmental cleanliness, affected litter distribution, age of affected neonates, and other populations affected. 4. Examine live animals, i.e., obtain serum samples from a random population, take rectal temperatures of affected neonates, and evaluate fecal pH. 5. Necropsy dead or dying pigs [that] appear to represent the problem. 6. Submit live pigs or appropriate tissues from necropsied pigs to a diagnostic laboratory. 7. Re-evaluate environmental conditions that may be contributing to the problem (remember, unit employees are a part of the pigs' environment). 8. Evaluate management procedures contributing to the disease problem, i.e., lack of adherence to all-in all-out, rapid turn-around decreasing cleaning time etc. Following this format and communicating with diagnosticians should provide for positive results for the producers both entities serve.
TI  - Sarcina -like bacteria, Clostridium fallax and Clostridium sordellii in lambs with abomasal bloat, haemorrhage and ulcers.
AB  - A study of abomasal disease in lambs aged 2-5 weeks, made during the period 1993-1998, included 67 cases and 45 non-affected controls. Gross pathological findings included various combinations of bloat, haemorrhage and ulcers in the abomasum. Sarcina -like bacteria were found in sections and smears from the abomasum of 79% (53/67) of the cases. From one case, a lamb with abomasal bloat, the anaerobic "packet"-forming Sarcina ventriculi was cultivated from the abomasal contents and identified by biochemical reactions and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Sarcina -like bacteria were observed microscopically in specimens from 94% (44/47) of the lambs with abomasal gas and in 45% (9/20) of those with ulcers or haemorrhage or both but little gas. On culture, abomasal contents from 41 cases yielded Clostridium fallax from 16 (39%) and Clostridium sordellii from eight (20%); abomasal cultures from 30 control lambs were negative for the three bacterial species. Quantitative cultivation, carried out on abomasal contents from live lambs and lambs dead </=3 h, showed that Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus spp. were present in the majority of both cases and controls, with no significant differences in the mean numbers.
TI  - Proximity of periplasmic loops in the metal-Tetracycline/H(+) antiporter of Escherichia coli observed on site-directed chemical cross-linking.
AB  - Our previous study on second-site suppressor mutations of the Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H(+) antiporter suggested that Leu(30) and Ala(354), located in periplasmic loop 1-2 and 11-12, respectively, are conformationally linked to each other (Kawabe, T., and Yamaguchi, A. (1999) FEBS Lett. 457, 169-173). To determine the spatial proximity of these two residues, cross-linking gel-shift assays of the L30C/A354C double mutant were performed after the mutant had been oxidized with Cu(2+)/o-phenanthroline. The results indicated that Leu(30) and Ala(354) are close to each other but that Gly(62), which is located in cytoplasmic loop 2-3, and Ala(354) are distant from each other, as a negative control. Then, a single Cys residue was introduced into each of the six periplasmic loop regions (P1-P6), and eleven double mutants were constructed. Of these eleven double Cys mutants, the L30C/A354C and L30C/T235C mutants showed a mobility shift on oxidation, indicating that P1 is spatially close to P4 as well as P6. In contrast, the other nine mutants, L30C/S92C, L30C/S156C, L30C/S296C, S92C/S296C, S92C/T235C, S92C/A354C, S156C/T235C, S156C/S296C, and S156C/A354C, showed no mobility shift under oxidized conditions on intramolecular cross-linking. The S92C and S296C mutants showed dimerization on intermolecular cross-linking, indicating that P2 and P5 are located at the periphery of the helix bundle.
TI  - Nosocomial Escherichia coli O157 infection.
AB  - Nosocomial transmission of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 to two patients and three nurses is described. The index case presented with rectal bleeding rather than diarrhoea, and additional infection control measures were therefore only instituted after detection of the organism. Of the nurses, two were asymptomatic and detected on a screening programme of all staff in contact with the affected patients. Two patients died, one from Clostridium perfringens bacteraemia. The use by staff of full protective gowns for handling patients from their first onset of diarrhoea is recommended, rather than plastic aprons. Interest from the media was intense, despite the small number of patients and staff affected, and early preparations for media enquiries should be made in such episodes.
TI  - Comparative pathology of bacterial enteric diseases of swine.
AB  - Enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. Clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. The most common etiological agents include Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Lawsonia intracellularis, Salmonella enterica, and Brachyspira (Serpulina) spp. With the exception of Brachyspira (Serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine dysentery, and Lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy, the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. Histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic E. coli and C. perfringens type A), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic E. coli and Brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with S. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain C. perfringens. Extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of E. coli and most serotypes of S. enterica. Enteric bacterial diseases of swine have been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. Several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.
TI  - Non-digestible oligosaccharides used as prebiotic agents: mode of production and  beneficial effects on animal and human health.
AB  - Prebiotic agents are food ingredients that are potentially beneficial to the health of consumers. The main commercial prebiotic agents consist of oligosaccharides and dietary fibres (mainly inulin). They are essentially obtained by one of three processes: 1) the direct extraction of natural polysaccharides from plants; 2) the controlled hydrolysis of such natural polysaccharides; 3) enzymatic synthesis, using hydrolases and/or glycosyl transferases. Both of these enzyme types catalyse transglycosylation reactions, allowing synthesis of small molecular weight synthetic oligosaccharides from mono- and disaccharides. Presently, in Europe, inulin-type fructans, characterised by the presence of fructosyl units bound to the beta-2,1 position of sucrose, are considered as one of the carbohydrate prebiotic references. Prebiotics escape enzymatic digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and enter the caecum without change to their structure. None are excreted in the stools, indicating that they are fermented by colonic flora so as to give a mixture of short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate and butyrate), L-lactate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. By stimulating bifidobacteria, they may have the following implications for health: 1) potential protective effects against colorectal cancer and infectious bowel diseases by inhibiting putrefactive bacteria (Clostridium perfringens ) and pathogen bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Listeria and Shigella ), respectively; 2) improvement of glucid and lipid metabolisms; 3) fibre-like properties by decreasing the renal nitrogen excretion; 4) improvement in the bioavailability of essential minerals; and 5) low cariogenic factor. These potential beneficial effects have been largely studied in animals but have not really been proven in humans. The development of a second generation of oligosaccharides and the putative implication of a complex bacterial trophic chain in the intestinal prebiotic fermentation process are also discussed.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Turkish medicinal plants.
AB  - A total of 76 extracts from 35 plants available in the Turkish flora were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against five pathogenic bacteria and a yeast. Sixteen crude extracts from eight plant species were found to possess an activity against at least one or more test microorganisms. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the most active crude extracts was also carried out with the most active extracts. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Candida albicans (yeast) is discussed.
TI  - The VirR response regulator from Clostridium perfringens binds independently to two imperfect direct repeats located upstream of the pfoA promoter.
AB  - Regulation of toxin production in the gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium perfringens occurs at the level of transcription and involves a two-component signal transduction system. The sensor histidine kinase is encoded by the virS gene, while its cognate response regulator is encoded by the virR gene. We have constructed a VirR expression plasmid in Escherichia coli and purified the resultant His-tagged VirR protein. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that VirR binds to the region upstream of the pfoA gene, which encodes perfringolysin O, but not to regions located upstream of the VirR-regulated plc, colA, and pfoR genes, which encode alpha-toxin, collagenase, and a putative pfoA regulator, respectively. The VirR binding site was shown by DNase I footprinting to be a 52-bp core sequence situated immediately upstream of the pfoA promoter. When this region was deleted, VirR was no longer able to bind to the pfoA promoter. The binding site was further localized to two imperfect direct repeats (CCCAGTTNTNCAC) by site-directed mutagenesis. Binding and protection analysis of these mutants indicated that VirR had the ability to bind independently to the two repeated sequences. Based on these observations it is postulated that the VirR positively regulates the synthesis of perfringolysin O by binding directly to a region located immediately upstream of the pfoA promoter and activating transcription.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of Coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of Coptis japonica (Makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (BS), berberine iodide (BI), palmatine chloride (PC), and palmatine sulfate(PS)], as well as that of Thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The biologically active constituents of the Coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (BC), palmatine iodide (PI), and coptisine chloride (CC) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. In a test using 500 microg/disk, BC and PI produced a clear inhibitory effect against Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli. At 1000 microg/ disk, CC revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas EGCG exhibited weak growth inhibition against only C. perfringens and C. paraputrificum. Among various isoquinoline alkaloids, BC exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward C. perfringens than BI and BS, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in PI compared to PC and PS. The Coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of B. longum and C. perfringens.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - Fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Food temperatures were recorded at the time of sampling. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (APCs), spore counts (SCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (CCs) for water and swab samples. In addition, Petrifilm Escherichia coli count (PC) plates were used for the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. The presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic E. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. Predominant colonies isolated from APC plates were characterized to the genus level. Holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees C. Mean APC values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log CFU/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Mean SC values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log CFU/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. A mean EC value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g for food samples and mean CC values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/ml and 1.3 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. Mean PC values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log CFU/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log CFU/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, Clostridium perfringens in 16%, Salmonella spp. in 2%, and E. coli (non-O157:H+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. E. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. The 340 isolates obtained from APC plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. It was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.
TI  - Elimination of viruses, phages, bacteria and Cryptosporidium by a new generation  Aquaguard point-of-use water treatment unit.
AB  - The elimination of human viruses, phages, bacteria and Cryptosporidium oocysts by a new generation commercial Aquaguard purifier for the domestic treatment of drinking water, has been evaluated. The unit basically consists of a candle prefilter, activated carbon filter and ultraviolet irradiation compartment. Drinking water seeded with selected laboratory test strains of resistant micro-organisms was passed through the unit. Similar tests were carried out with sewage-contaminated river water and secondary treated waste water containing naturally occurring organisms. Test procedures were based on internationally accepted principles for the evaluation of point-of-use water treatment units, including a standard test protocol of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Reduction in numbers of seeded test organisms at several log levels higher than those expected in water for which the unit is intended, was determined by the cultivation of viable organisms. In the case of seeded viruses and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts the qualitative absence of nucleic acid was determined by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the design flow rate of one litre per minute, numbers of polio, hepatitis A, adeno types 2 and 41, rota SA11, human rota and astro viruses, as well as somatic and MS2 coliphages, and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, total coliform bacteria, enterococci, heterotrophic bacteria and C. parvum oocysts, were reduced by more than 99.999% in all waters tested. This efficiency conforms to specifications for such units. The quality of the treated water was well within microbiological limits of international specifications for drinking water.
TI  - Identification of structural and functional domains of the tetracycline efflux protein TetA(P) from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens tetracycline-resistance protein, TetA(P), is an integral inner-membrane protein that mediates the active efflux of tetracycline from the cell. TetA(P) acts as an antiporter, presumably transporting a divalent cation-tetracycline complex in exchange for a proton, and is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs). Two glutamate residues that are located in predicted TMD 2 were previously shown to be required for the active efflux of tetracycline by TetA(P). To identify additional residues that are required for the structure or function of TetA(P), a random mutagenesis approach was used. Of the 61 tetracycline-susceptible mutants that were obtained in Escherichia coli, 31 different derivatives were shown to contain a single amino acid change that resulted in reduced tetracycline resistance. The stability of the mutant TetA(P) proteins was examined by immunoblotting and 19 of these strains were found to produce a detectable TetA(P) protein. The MIC of these derivatives ranged from 2 to 15 microg tetracycline ml(-1), compared to 30 microg tetracycline ml(-1) for the wild-type. The majority of these mutants clustered into three potential loop regions of the TetA(P) protein, namely the cytoplasmic loops 2-3 and 4-5, and loop 7-8, which is predicted to be located in the periplasm in E. coli. It is concluded that these regions are of functional significance in the TetA(P)-mediated efflux of tetracycline from the bacterial cell.
TI  - Identification of a Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin region required for large complex formation and cytotoxicity by random mutagenesis.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), a single polypeptide of 319 amino acids, has a unique multistep mechanism of action. In the first step, CPE binds to claudin proteins and/or a 50-kDa eukaryotic membrane protein receptor, forming a small ( approximately 90-kDa) complex. This small complex apparently then associates with a 70-kDa eukaryotic membrane protein, resulting in formation of a large complex that induces the onset of membrane permeability alterations. To better define the boundaries of CPE functional regions and to identify specific amino acid residues involved in various steps of CPE action, in this study we subjected the cloned cpe gene to random mutagenesis in XL-1 Red strains of Escherichia coli. Seven CPE random mutants with reduced cytotoxicity for Vero cells were phenotypically characterized for the ability to complete each step in CPE action. Five of these seven recombinant CPE (rCPE) random mutants (G49D, S59L, R116S, R137G, and S167P) exhibited binding characteristics similar to those of rCPE or native CPE, while the Y310C and W226Stop mutants showed reduced binding and no binding, respectively, to brush border membranes. Interestingly, two completely nontoxic mutants (G49D and S59L) were able to bind and form small complex but they did not mediate any detectable large complex formation. Another strongly attenuated mutant, R116S, formed reduced amounts of an anomalously migrating large complex. Collectively, these results provide further support for large complex formation being an essential step in CPE action and also identify the CPE region ranging from residues approximately 45 to 116 as important for large complex formation. Finally, we also report that limited removal of extreme N-terminal CPE sequences, which may occur in vivo during disease, stimulates cytotoxic activity by enhancing large complex formation.
TI  - Poor efficacy of residual chlorine disinfectant in drinking water to inactivate waterborne pathogens in distribution systems.
AB  - To evaluate the inactivating power of residual chlorine in a distribution system, test microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, bacteriophage phi-X 170, and poliovirus type 1) were added to drinking water samples obtained from two water treatment plants and their distribution system. Except for Escherichia coli, microorganisms remained relatively unaffected in water from the distribution systems tested. When sewage was added to the water samples, indigenous thermotolerant coliforms were inactivated only when water was obtained from sites very close to the treatment plant and containing a high residual chlorine concentration. Clostridium perfringens was barely inactivated, suggesting that the most resistant pathogens such as Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and human enteric viruses would not be inactivated. Our results suggest that the maintenance of a free residual concentration in a distribution system does not provide a significant inactivation of pathogens, could even mask events of contamination of the distribution, and thus would provide only a false sense of safety with little active protection of public health. Recent epidemiological studies that have suggested a significant waterborne level of endemic gastrointestinal illness could then be explained by undetected intrusions in the distribution system, intrusions resulting in the infection of a small number of individuals without eliciting an outbreak situation.
TI  - Dependence of the Raman signature of genomic B-DNA on nucleotide base sequence.
AB  - The vibrational spectra of four genomic and two synthetic DNAs, encompassing a wide range in base composition [poly(dA-dT). poly(dA-dT), 0% G + C; Clostridium perfringens DNA, 27% G + C; calf thymus DNA, 42% G + C; Escherichia coli DNA, 50% G + C; Micrococcus luteus DNA, 72% G + C; poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), 100% G + C] (dA: deoxyadenosine; dG: deoxyguanosine; dC: deoxycytidine; dT: thymidine), have been analyzed using Raman difference methods of high sensitivity. The results show that the Raman signature of B DNA depends in detail upon both genomic base composition and sequence. Raman bands assigned to vibrational modes of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone are among the most sensitive to base sequence, indicating that within the B family of conformations major differences occur in the backbone geometry of AT- and GC-rich domains. Raman bands assigned to in-plane vibrations of the purine and pyrimidine bases-particularly of A and T-exhibit large deviations from the patterns expected for random base distributions, establishing that Raman hypochromic effects in genomic DNA are also highly sequence dependent. The present study provides a basis for future use of Raman spectroscopy to analyze sequence-specific DNA-ligand interactions. The demonstration of sequence dependency in the Raman spectrum of genomic B DNA also implies the capability to distinguish genomic DNAs by means of their characteristic Raman signatures.
TI  - Bifidobacterium bifidum exhibits a lipopolysaccharide-like mitogenic activity for murine B lymphocytes.
AB  - To determine the role of bifidobacteria in the systemic and mucosal antibody response, we examined the direct modulatory effect of bifidobacteria on the synthesis of antibodies by murine spleen B cells. Whole spleen B cells were cultured with Bifidobacterium bifidum or Clostridium perfringens (Welch's bacilli, negative control), and antibody synthesis was measured by ELISA and enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The B. bifidum, but not C. perfringens, substantially increased total secretion of major immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes and the number of IgA-secreting cells. In addition, B. bifidum increased proliferation of spleen cells by threefold, and C. perfringens had little to diminishing effect on the cells. These results indicate that B. bifidum increased Ig synthesis through its mitogenic influence on B cells. Further, B. bifidum induced spleen B cells to be reactive to transforming growth factor-beta 1 and interleukin-5 and resulted in increased surface IgA expression (approximately threefold) and total IgA production (> 20-fold) but not increased production of IgM and IgG2a isotypes. Together, these studies indicate that B. bifidum can act as a lipopolysaccharide-like polyclonal activator for B cells. Furthermore, that bifidobacteria enable B cells to respond to transforming growth factor-beta 1 and interleukin-5 for the IgA production has important implications for the primary defense against pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with a sorghum-based fermented weaning cereal.
AB  - Microbiological surveys, to determine the quality and safety, were conducted on 45 sorghum samples comprising dry powders (n = 15) and corresponding fermented (n = 15) and cooked fermented porridge (n = 15) samples collected from households in an informal settlement of the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Mean aerobic plate counts, Gram-negative counts and bacterial spore counts of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge samples. However, mean lactic acid bacteria counts increased in fermented porridge samples, but decreased slightly in cooked fermented porridge samples. The mean pH value of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge, respectively. Bacillus (B.) cereus was detected in all 15 sorghum powder samples, while Escherichia (E.) coli was detected in 53%, Clostridium perfringens in 27%, Listeria monocytogenes in 13% and Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp., each in 7% of sorghum powder samples. Of the fermented porridge samples, 40% contained B. cereus and 7% contained E. coli. None of the pathogens tested for were detected in cooked fermented porridge samples. B. cereus (53%), B. subtilis (21%), B. thuringiensis (13%), B. licheniformis (10%) and B. coagulans (3%) were identified from 120 isolates randomly selected from spore count plates of the highest dilution showing growth.
TI  - Detection of viral pathogens by reverse transcriptase PCR and of microbial indicators by standard methods in the canals of the Florida Keys.
AB  - In order to assess the microbial water quality in canal waters throughout the Florida Keys, a survey was conducted to determine the concentration of microbial fecal indicators and the presence of human pathogenic microorganisms. A total of 19 sites, including 17 canal sites and 2 nearshore water sites, were assayed for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, coliphages, F-specific (F(+)) RNA coliphages, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and human enteric viruses (polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, hepatitis A viruses, Norwalk viruses, and small round-structured viruses). Numbers of coliforms ranged from <1 to 1, 410, E. coli organisms from <1 to 130, Clostridium spp. from <1 to 520, and enterococci from <1 to 800 CFU/100 ml of sample. Two sites were positive for coliphages, but no F(+) phages were identified. The sites were ranked according to microbial water quality and compared to various water quality standards and guidelines. Seventy-nine percent of the sites were positive for the presence of enteroviruses by reverse transcriptase PCR (polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, and echoviruses). Sixty-three percent of the sites were positive for the presence of hepatitis A viruses. Ten percent of the sites were positive for the presence of Norwalk viruses. Ninety-five percent of the sites were positive for at least one of the virus groups. These results indicate that the canals and nearshore waters throughout the Florida Keys are being impacted by human fecal material carrying human enteric viruses through current wastewater treatment strategies such as septic tanks. Exposure to canal waters through recreation and work may be contributing to human health risks.
TI  - Immunological evidence for a bacterial toxin aetiology in sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Toxin-specific antibodies to clostridial, enterobacterial and staphylococcal toxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome were studied in sera from sudden infant death syndrome infants and a comparison group of infants (babies with phenylketonuria). The results indicated a higher proportion of sera from sudden infant death syndrome infants contained IgA that bound to clostridial and enterobacterial toxins but a higher proportion of sera from the phenylketonuria comparison group contained IgA that bound staphylococcal toxins. The higher proportion of serum samples with IgG and IgM in the healthy comparison babies serum probably indicated immunity in this group of babies to these toxins. The effect of gender and age had a minimal effect on the incidence of these antibodies. The presence of toxin-specific antibodies in sudden infant death syndrome and the of comparison infants suggests that all infants are exposed to these toxins and most babies successfully overcome the toxic challenge. Some infants with predisposing risk factors (temperature change, smoking, infection, immune development, sleeping position, etc.) that could affect the baby's immune competency could succumb to these and possibly other toxins. This immunological evidence further strengthens the view that bacterial toxins are a significant cause of sudden infant death syndrome.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and transcriptional regulation of the operon encoding a putative N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate epimerase (nanE) and sialic acid lyase (nanA) in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens can obtain sialic acid from host tissues by the activity  of sialidase enzymes on sialoglycoconjugates. After sialic acid is transported into the cell, sialic acid lyase (NanA) then catalyzes the hydrolysis of sialic acid into pyruvate and N-acetylmannosamine. The latter is converted for use as a biosynthetic intermediate or carbohydrate source in a pathway including an epimerase (NanE) that converts N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. A 4.0-kb DNA fragment from C. perfringens NCTC 8798 that contains the nanE and nanA genes has been cloned. The identification of the nanA gene product as sialic acid lyase was confirmed by overexpressing the gene and measuring sialic acid lyase activity in a nanA Escherichia coli strain, EV78. The nanA gene product was also shown to restore growth to EV78 in minimal medium with sialic acid as the sole carbon source. By using Northern blot experiments, it was demonstrated that the nanE and nanA genes comprise an operon and that transcription of the operon in C. perfringens is inducible by the addition of sialic acid to the growth medium. The Northern blot experiments also showed that there is no catabolite repression of nanE-nanA transcription by glucose. With a plasmid construct containing a promoterless cpe-gusA gene fusion, in which beta-glucuronidase activity indicated that the gusA gene acted as a reporter for transcription, a promoter was localized to the region upstream of the nanE gene. Primer extension experiments then allowed us to identify a sialic acid-inducible promoter located 30 bp upstream of the nanE coding sequence.
TI  - Reversal of tetracycline resistance mediated by different bacterial tetracycline  resistance determinants by an inhibitor of the Tet(B) antiport protein.
AB  - Active efflux is a useful strategy by which bacteria evade growth inhibition by antibiotics. Certain semisynthetic tetracycline (TC) analogs, substituted at the 13th carbon at C-6 on ring C of the TC molecule, blocked TC efflux as revealed in everted membrane vesicles from class B TC-resistant (Tcr) Escherichia coli (M. L. Nelson, B. H. Park, J. S. Andrews, V. A. Georgian, R. C. Thomas, and S. B. Levy, J. Med. Chem. 36:370-377, 1993). A representative C-13-substituted analog, 13-cyclopentylthio-5-OH-TC (13-CPTC), was shown to competitively inhibit TC translocation by the Tet(B) protein, blocking the uptake of TC into vesicles and therefore the efflux of TC from whole cells. Against Tcr E. coli, 13-CPTC, when used in combination with doxycycline, produced synergistic inhibition of growth. 13-CPTC was shown to increase the uptake of [3H]TC into the resistant cells. 13-CPTC alone was a potent growth inhibitor against TC-susceptible (Tcs) and Tcr Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci specifying class K or class L efflux-dependent TC resistance mechanisms or, unexpectedly, the class M ribosomal protection mechanism. These findings indicate that derivatives of TC, identified by their ability to block the Tet(B) efflux protein, can restore TC activity against Tcr bacteria bearing either of the two known resistance mechanisms. Blocking drug efflux and increasing intracellular drug concentrations constitute an effective approach to reversing TC resistance and may be generally applicable to other antibiotics rendered ineffective by efflux proteins.
TI  - C-terminal amino acid residues are required for the folding and cholesterol binding property of perfringolysin O, a pore-forming cytolysin.
AB  - Perfringolysin O (theta-toxin) is a pore-forming cytolysin whose activity is triggered by binding to cholesterol in the plasma membrane. The cholesterol binding activity is predominantly localized in the beta-sheet-rich C-terminal half. In order to determine the roles of the C-terminal amino acids in theta-toxin conformation and activity, mutants were constructed by truncation of the C terminus. While the mutant with a two-amino acid C-terminal truncation retains full activity and has similar structural features to native theta-toxin, truncation of three amino acids causes a 40% decrease in hemolytic activity due to the reduction in cholesterol binding activity with a slight change in its higher order structure. Furthermore, both mutants were found to be poor at in vitro refolding after denaturation in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, resulting in a dramatic reduction in cholesterol binding and hemolytic activities. These activity losses were accompanied by a slight decrease in beta-sheet content. A mutant toxin with a five-amino acid truncation expressed in Escherichia coli is recovered as a further truncated form lacking the C-terminal 21 amino residues. The product retains neither cholesterol binding nor hemolytic activities and shows a highly disordered structure as detected by alterations in the circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence spectra. These results show that the C-terminal region of theta-toxin has two distinct roles; the last 21 amino acids are involved to maintain an ordered overall structure, and in addition, the last two amino acids at the C-terminal end are needed for protein folding in vitro, in order to produce the necessary conformation for optimal cholesterol binding and hemolytic activities.
TI  - Promoter upstream bent DNA activates the transcription of the Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C gene in a low temperature-dependent manner.
AB  - The phospholipase C gene (plc) of Clostridium perfringens possesses three phased  A-tracts forming bent DNA upstream of the promoter. An in vitro transcription assay involving C.perfringens RNA polymerase (RNAP) showed that the phased A-tracts have a stimulatory effect on the plc promoter, and that the effect is proportional to the number of A-tracts, and more prominent at lower temperature. A gel retardation assay and hydroxyl radical footprinting revealed that the phased A-tracts facilitate the formation of the RNAP-plc promoter complex through extension of the contact region. The upstream (UP) element of the Escherichia coli rrnB P1 promoter stimulated the downstream promoter activity temperature independently, differing from the phased A-tracts. When the UP element was placed upstream of the plc promoter, low temperature-dependent stimulation was observed, although this effect was less prominent than that of the phased A-tracts. These results suggest that both the phased A-tracts and UP element cause low temperature-dependent activation of the plc promoter through a similar mechanism, and that the more efficient low temperature-dependent activation by the phased A-tracts may be due to an increase in the bending angle at a lower temperature.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens beta-toxin is sensitive to thiol-group modification but does not require a thiol group for lethal activity.
AB  - The beta-toxin gene isolated from Clostridium perfringens type B was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion gene in Escherichia coli. The purified GST-beta-toxin fusion protein from the E. coli transformant cells was not lethal. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant beta-toxin (r toxin) isolated by thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein was G-S-N-D-I-G-K-T-T-T. Biological activities and molecular mass of r toxin were indistinguishable from those of native beta-toxin (n toxin) purified from C. perfringens type C. Replacement of Cys-265 with alanine or serine by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in little loss of the activity. Treatment of C265A with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which inactivated lethal activity of r toxin and n toxin, led to no loss of the activity. The substitution of tyrosine or histidine for Cys-265 significantly diminished lethal activity. In addition, treatment of C265H with ethoxyformic anhydride which specifically modifies histidyl residue resulted in significant decrease in lethal activity, but that of r toxin with the agent did not. These results showed that replacement of the cysteine residue at position 265 with amino acids with large size of side chain or introduction of functional groups in the position resulted in loss of lethal activity of the toxin. Replacement of Tyr-266, Leu-268 or Trp-275 resulted in complete loss of lethal activity. Simultaneous administration of r toxin and W275A led to a decrease in lethal activity of beta-toxin. These observations suggest that the site essential for the activity is close to the cysteine residue.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of alpha-toxin from two different strains (NCTC8237 and CER89L43) of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens is the major virulence determinant for gas gangrene in man. The gene encoding the alpha-toxin has been cloned into E. coli from two strains of the bacterium (NCTC8237 and CER89L43) and subsequently purified to homogeneity. The two strains of alpha-toxin differ by five amino acids, resulting in the toxin from NCTC8237 being sensitive to chymotrypsin digestion while that from CER89L43 is resistant. The alpha-toxin from each of these strains has been crystallized in two different forms by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293 K. CER89L43 form I crystals belong to space group R32 and have two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and a unit cell with a = b = 151.4, c = 195.5 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. The crystals diffracted to dmin = 1.90 A. The characteristics of the NCTC8237 form I crystals have already been reported. The form II crystals from both strains belong to space group C2221 with one molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and, for strain CER89L43, have cell dimensions a = 61.05, b = 177.50, c = 79.05 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees, while for strain NCTC8237 the cell dimensions are a = 60.50, b = 175.70, c = 80.20 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees. The crystals diffracted to maximum resolutions of 1.85 and 2.1 A for the CER89L43 and the NCTC8237 strains, respectively.
TI  - Immunostimulatory properties of genomic DNA from different bacterial species.
AB  - Bacterial DNA has potent immunological properties because of its content of immunostimulatory sequences centering on CpG motifs. To investigate whether DNA from various bacterial species differ in these properties, the activity of a panel of DNA was assessed in in vitro cultures of murine spleen cells. This panel varied in base composition and included DNA from Clostridium perfringens (CP), Escherichia coli (EC), Micrococcus lysodeikticus (MC), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and, as a mammalian DNA control, calf thymus (CT) DNA. In assays of IL-12 and IFN-gamma production as well as B cell mitogenesis, these DNA showed marked differences in their immunostimulatory activity. For both cytokine and B cell responses, EC DNA demonstrated the highest activity while CP DNA had the lowest activity among the bacterial DNA. To determine whether differences in stimulatory capacity resulted from differences in cell uptake, the activity of DNA complexed with lipofectin was tested. While the addition of lipofectin to DNA increased stimulation by all DNA, it did not change the relative potency of the DNA tested. These results indicate that bacterial DNA differ in their immunostimulatory capacity, most likely reflecting their content of CpG motifs. These differences could affect the induction of innate immunity as well as the consequences of infection.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Experimental investigations into the effect of Escherichia coli and Clostridium  perfringens on the steroid estrone].
AB  - Together with the faecal and the urinary discharge of animals and humans natural  and synthetic estrogenes are excreted into the environment. About their degradation in the environment only few facts are known. Their reduction is probably of microbial enzymatical nature. For looking into that question it was investigated by in-vitro-attempts whether Escherichia coli or Clostridium perfringens influence the estrone. Therefore estrone was incubated together with the microorganisms tested (experimental groups) and without those (control groups) in nutrient medium for these bacteria over 48 hours with 37 degrees C (aerobic) or 42 degrees C (anaerobic). For the executed procedure an enzyme immunoassay was used. It could be seen that E. coli does not show a provable effect on the estrone concentration under this conditions. Whereas C. perfringens might have a potency for the degradation of the hormone tested. The experiments shows that there exists obviously a difference between estrone and 4-pregnene-20 beta-o1-3-one in the same system of test.
TI  - Oligofructose contributes to the protective role of bifidobacteria in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in quails.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are dominant in the gut of full-term infants, although colonisation by them is often delayed in preterm neonates. Bifidobacteria are recognised to have beneficial effects on digestive disorders and they might prevent neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a gastrointestinal disease that predominantly affects premature infants. They have been shown to protect gnotobiotic quails against NEC-like lesions when the birds were inoculated with faecal flora from preterm infants, decreasing the clostridial population. The present study was designed to investigate whether oligofructose, which stimulates the activity of bifidobacteria, may enhance their protective role. Experiments were done in eight groups of germ-free quails for 28 days. The groups differed as to their bacterial status, diet and environment. Quails were inoculated with one of two flora from premature twins. The first flora included Bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum, Escherichia coli and no clostridia. The second flora included clostridial species and was associated with B. infantis-longum. Caecal bacterial population and metabolism changes were investigated with a lactose (6%) diet versus a lactose-oligofructose (3%-3%) diet, either in a gnotobiotic environment or in an ordinary environment permitting post-colonisation by exogenous bacteria. In both environments and with both flora, oligofructose significantly increased the level of bifidobacteria and this was associated with a decrease of E. coli or C. perfringens and C. ramosum. The bacterial changes in the ordinary environment depended on the initial composition of the microflora and the colonisation resistance against exogenous bacteria was more efficient with the flora that included B. pseudo-catenulatum. The changes in caecal pH and short-chain fatty acids were minimal. It was demonstrated that, irrespective of the environmental conditions, the use of oligofructose helped to prevent the overgrowth of bacteria implicated in necrotising enterocolitis in preterm neonates.
TI  - [Experimental investigations on the effect of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens on the steroid 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one].
AB  - In the context of investigations about the stability of sexual steroids, which are excreted from animals to the environment, it was checked whether microorganisms of the intestinal microflora influence the degradation of these compounds. The germs used were Escherichia coli or Clostridium perfringens. The hormone investigated was the 4-pregnene-20 beta-ol-3-one (20 beta P4). 20 beta P4 was incubated together with the microbes (experimental groups) and without these (control groups) in nutrient medium for the bacteria over 48 hours at 37 degrees C or 42 degrees C. As a result no differences in concentration were found between the experimental and control groups after incubation. Neither an effect of Escherichia coli nor one of Clostridium perfringens was detectable on the concentration of 20 beta P4. However there was a significant decrease of the 20 beta P4-concentration after the incubation over 48 hours at 37 degrees C or 42 degrees C in both the experimental and control groups. That could indicate a thermal degradation of the compound tested.
TI  - Ecological and physiological studies on large intestinal bacteria in relation to  production of hydrolytic and reductive enzymes involved in formation of genotoxic metabolites.
AB  - Several hydrolytic and reductive bacterial enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, GN; beta-glucosidase, GS; arylsulphatase, AS; azoreductase, AR; nitroreductase, NR) involved in production of mutagenic or genotoxic metabolites were measured in human colonic contents. Cell-associated AS and extracellular GS were approximately twice as high in the distal colon compared with the proximal bowel, while AR changed little throughout the gut. Measurements of these enzymes in faeces from seven healthy donors confirmed that the majority were cell-associated, and demonstrated high levels of inter-individual variability. NR decreased four-fold between the proximal and distal colon while extracellular GN was reduced by 50%. Most probable number (MPN) analysis on faeces obtained from six healthy donors showed that counts of intestinal bacteria producing GS and AR were c. 10(10) and 10(11)/g, respectively, in all samples tested. Numbers of GN- and AS-forming organisms were between two and three orders of magnitude lower. Inter-individual carriage rates of bacterial populations synthesising NR were highly variable. Screening of 20 pure cultures of intestinal bacteria, belonging to six different genera, showed that Bacteroides ovatus, in particular, synthesised large amounts of GS, whereas B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum formed the highest cell-associated levels of GN. In general, bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus did not produce significant amounts of AR. All five clostridia studied (Clostridium bifermentans, C. septicum, C. perfringens, C. sporogenes and C. butyricum) produced NR and AR, as did the bacteroides (B. fragilis, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus). Escherichia coli and C. perfringens formed large amounts of NR. Levels of AS production were invariably low and few of the organisms screened synthesised this enzyme. In-vitro studies investigating the effect of intestinal transit time on enzyme production, in a three-stage (V1-V3) continuous culture model of the colon operated at system retention times (R) of either 31.1 or 68.4 h, showed that specific activities of GS were up to four-fold higher (V3) at R = 31.1 h. Bacteriological analysis demonstrated that representative populations of colonic micro-organisms were maintained in the fermentation system, and indicated that changes in GS activity were not related to numbers of the predominant anaerobic or facultative anaerobic species within the model, but were explainable on the basis of substrate-induced modulation of bacterial metabolism.
TI  - Incidence risk and aetiology of mammary abnormalities in dry ewes in 10 flocks in southern Greece.
AB  - In a field investigation of 10 flocks in Southern Greece, 3367 dairy ewes were examined twice, in order to estimate the incidence risk and the aetiology of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period. Abnormal secretion, lumps, nodules, diffuse hardness, abscesses and cysts were the abnormalities detected. The cumulative incidence of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period was 5.1% (95% confidence interval: 4.4-5.8%); 47% of the cases detected developed during the first three weeks after cessation of lactation. Despite variation in the flock size, there was no between-flock variation in the risk of a ewe developing mammary abnormalities. Staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative isolates) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from mammary samples; Actinomyces pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens, streptococci and Escherichia coli were also isolated. Resistance was encountered among the staphylococcal isolates.
TI  - Mechanism of inhibition of tannic acid and related compounds on the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Tannic acid, propyl gallate and methyl gallate, but not gallic acid, were found to be inhibitory to the growth of intestinal bacteria Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285, Clostridium clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, C. perfringens ATCC 13124, C. paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and S. typhimurium YG1041 at 100-1000 microg/ml in culture broth. Neither Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697 nor Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 was inhibited by any of the above compounds up to 500 microg/ml. Tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. The inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. The growth of E. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. Neither B. infantis nor L. acidophilus require iron for growth. This probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. Because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.
TI  - Effect of bacterial association on virulence of Entamoeba histolytica to baby hamster kidney cell monolayers.
AB  - Axenic E. histolytica trophozoite strain NIH:200 and HMI:IMSS when co-associated  with aerobic bacteria Escherichia coli strain K12 and serotype 056 showed marked increase in virulence as observed by destruction of baby hamster kidney (BHK) monolayers. However, when incubated with anaerobic bacterial strains Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis virulence remained unaltered. Further, adherence of E. histolytica to BHK monolayer was found to be mediated by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the Escherichia coli-Clostridium perfringens shuttle vector pJIR1457 to Clostridium botulinum type A strains.
AB  - An RP4-oriT shuttle vector pJIR1457 originally developed for Clostridium perfringens was successfully transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Clostridium botulinum type A strains and to a nontoxigenic C. botulinum type A-transposon Tn916 mutant strain lacking the entire toxin gene cluster. The light chain (LC) of botulinum toxin was highly expressed in the toxin deletion mutant strain from a pJIR1457 construct containing the recombinant botulinal gene for LC. This shuttle vector system will be valuable for genetic analysis of C. botulinum and will enable genetic manipulation and recombinant expression studies of botulinum neurotoxins as pharmaceutical agents.
TI  - Foodborne illness in the elderly.
AB  - The elderly (> or = 65 years of age) are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from foodborne-induced gastroenteritis than younger individuals. Several factors contribute to the increased susceptibility to foodborne infections as well as other infections in elderly populations. These include an age-associated decrease in humoral and cellular immunity, age-related changes in the gastrointestinal tract (decreased production of gastric acid and decreased intestinal motility), malnutrition, lack of exercise, entry into nursing homes, and excessive use of antibiotics. Data from foodborne outbreaks associated with nursing homes indicate that the elderly are more likely to die from foodborne Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus infections than the general population. Infections by Salmonella species are the most common cause of illness and death in nursing homes with Salmonella enteritidis as the major cause of both morbidity and mortality. While it is impossible to turn back the clock, practicing a healthy life-style with regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, receiving regular health care, paying attention to personal hygiene, and monitoring food preparation and handling should lead to a reduced incidence of foodborne and other infections in the elderly.
TI  - Alteration in sporulation, enterotoxin production, and protein synthesis by Clostridium perfringens type A following heat shock.
AB  - Application of a heat shock (43 to 50 degrees C) applied early during the sporulation process of Clostridium perfringens delayed spore and enterotoxin production. Final levels of heat-resistant spores were similar to the control, but enterotoxin levels were reduced when the heat shock was applied at the third hour of incubation. The response of the microorganism to the heat shock was also examined by analysis of pulse-labeled proteins. Seven heat shock proteins (HSPs) associated with vegetative cells were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Most were localized mainly in the membrane, although one small protein was mostly present in the cytoplasm. Fewer HSPs were detected during sporulation. Two HSPs were immunologically related to the GroEL and DnaK HSPs from Lactobacillus lactis and Escherichia coli, respectively.

TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Microbiological quality of hot meals served by airlines.
AB  - The microbiological quality of 1,012 hot meals served on aircraft was studied in  1991 to 1994. The material included dishes prepared in 33 countries all over the world. The geometric means of aerobic colony counts and Escherichia coli were significantly lower in breakfasts (P < 0.05) than in main dishes. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 30 samples (3.0%), Bacillus cereus being the most common pathogen. The frequencies of B. cereus and Staphylococcus aureus did not differ between breakfasts and main dishes. Many of the samples exceeded the minimum acceptable microbiological standards recommended by the Association of European Airlines (AEA) for E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella; i.e., 8.2%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. There were considerable differences in aerobic colony counts and E. coli counts between countries where the food was prepared.
TI  - Evaluation of microbial hazards during processing of Spanish prepared Flamenquin.
AB  - Flamenquin is a traditional, prepared, frozen meat product from the south of Spain made with minced pork, chicken, and cooked ham. Since it is a prepared raw meat product some microbial hazards could be associated with the process of making it. Microbiological analyses have been performed throughout the various steps of processing over a 1-year period to evaluate microbial hazards in the commercial process. High levels of microorganisms were observed all through the processing of this product, the mincing and mixing steps being where major microbial contamination was observed. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected during processing. Raw materials and food handlers were the principal sources of microbial contamination. A modification of processing to include a heating step after mincing and mixing and an improvement in hygiene practices could eliminate the microbial hazards. Both modifications should be noted for the implementation of a hazard analysis of critical control points (HACCP) program in commercial flamenquin processing.
TI  - Dietary zinc oxide in weaned pigs--effects on performance, tissue concentrations, morphology, neutrophil functions and faecal microflora.
AB  - The uptake and distribution of zinc in tissues and the effects of 2500 ppm dietary zinc oxide on health, faecal microflora, and the functions of circulating neutrophils were evaluated in weaned pigs. One group was fed a zinc supplement diet and another group was used as a control. All pigs remained healthy throughout the study, but the supplemented animals showed better performance than the controls. The serum zinc values rose rapidly. At autopsy, carried out at the age of 63 days, the zinc concentrations in liver tissue were 4.5 times higher, and in renal tissue two times higher in the supplemented group than in controls (P<0.001). Microscopic examination showed increased lipid accumulation in hepatocytes from supplemented pigs. No effect on the number of excreted Escherichia coli and enterococci per gram faeces or on the functions of circulating neutrophils was observed. Dietary supplementation with 2500 ppm ZnO for up to two weeks after weaning appears to be potentially beneficial in the prevention of postweaning diarrhoea in pigs.
TI  - Chloramphenicol resistance in Clostridium difficile is encoded on Tn4453 transposons that are closely related to Tn4451 from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance gene catD from Clostridium difficile was shown to  be encoded on the transposons Tn4453a and Tn4453b, which were structurally and functionally related to Tn4451 from Clostridium perfringens. Tn4453a and Tn4453b excised precisely from recombinant plasmids, generating a circular form, as is the case for Tn4451. Evidence that this process is mediated by Tn4453-encoded tnpX genes was obtained from experiments which showed that in trans these genes complemented a Tn4451tnpX delta 1 mutation for excision. Nucleotide sequencing showed that the joint of the circular form generated by the excision of Tn4453a and Tn4453b was similar to that from Tn4451. These results suggest that the Tn4453-encoded TnpX proteins bind to similar DNA target sequences and function in a manner comparable to that of TnpX from Tn4453. Furthermore, it has been shown that Tn4453a and Tn4453b can be transferred to suitable recipient cells by RP4 and therefore are mobilizable transposons. It is concluded that, like Tn4451, they must encode a functional tnpZ gene and a target oriT or RSA site. The finding that related transposable elements are present in C. difficile and C. perfringens has implications for the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and the mobile elements on which they are found within the clostridia.
TI  - Fatal sepsis due to Escherichia coli after second-trimester amniocentesis.
AB  - The case of a pregnant woman (16th week) needing an amniocentesis is reported. She rapidly developed a septic shock. Despite vaginal delivery, curettage and antibiotherapy, the patient deteriorated with the onset of an acute respiratory distress syndrome and a typical disseminated intravascular coagulation. Bacteriological data showed positive blood cultures to Escherichia coli. Amniotic liquid was positive to the same E. coli. Cultures obtained from instruments, disinfectant solutions and gel used during the procedure were negative. On the contrary, amniotic and fetal cultures were positive to E. coli and Clostridium perfringens. She died 2 days later. The incidence of septic shock following amniocentesis is very low but we report the first case of fatal sepsis and multiorgan failure, due to E. coli and C. perfringens. The mechanisms of infection are discussed: contamination from the instruments, systemic dissemination of bacteria coming from an asymptomatic intra-amniotic infection, and inoculation of the placenta with a needle passing through the bowel.
TI  - Isolation of a beta-galactosidase-encoding gene from Bacillus licheniformis: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Bacillus licheniformis beta-galactosidase gene, lacBl, was cloned on a 5.8-kb HindIII fragment into pBR322 and expressed by its own promoter in Escherichia coli. Deletion and complementation analysis showed that the enzyme-encoding region was located on a 4. 1-kb HindIII-ClaI fragment. The transcription region for the lacBl was identified on this fragment with promoter- and terminator-probe plasmids. The deduced sequence of 149 aa of the N-terminal part of lacBl showed aa sequence homology with beta-Gal from B. stearothermophilus, B. circulans, Haloferax alicantei, Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter sp.. No significant homology was shared with those found in the lacZ and lacS families. The recombinant beta-galactosidase (LacB1) was purified by FPLC. The molecular mass of the enzyme (80 kDa) and its optimal pH (5.7) and temperature (45 degrees C) were determined.
TI  - MEN 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, PBP affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of MEN 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. MIC data showed that MEN 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (MIC90 < or = 0.5 mg/L) and against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 < or = 2 mg/L), with reduced activity only against Providencia stuartii (MIC90 = 8 mg/L). MEN 10700 was also active against anaerobic species such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis as well as Moraxella catarrhalis. It was moderately active against Enterococcus faecalis and inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. Its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. MEN 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class I enzymes. It bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.
TI  - DNA structural integrity and base composition affect ultraviolet light-induced oxidative DNA damage.
AB  - We previously demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV) light (254 nm) induced the formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in DNA via a singlet oxygen mechanism. In the present paper, we provide novel findings that DNA structure and base composition significantly affect the yield of 8-OHdG by UV radiation. Unlike ionizing radiation that induces 8-OHdG both in free 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) and in DNA, UV light induced 8-OHdG formation in intact DNA and polydG.dC, but not in dG. When thermally denatured DNA was irradiated with UV light, the yield of 8-OHdG was reduced by more than 80% compared to intact DNA. Oxygenation of the denatured DNA solution did not restore the yield of UV-induced 8-OHdG. Irradiation of DNA with different AT/GC ratios showed that the yield of UV-induced 8-OHdG varied in proportion to the AT content, suggesting that AT base pairs in DNA enhance generation of the oxidizing species and subsequent oxidation of dG. The natural antioxidants genistein, estradiol, protocatechuic acid (PCA), and oleanolic acid (OA) were investigated for their inhibition of UV-induced 8-OHdG. Genistein and estradiol, that intercalate into DNA as shown by a computer modeling, significantly quenched UV-induced 8-OHdG, whereas PCA and OA did not fit into DNA and exhibited weak or no effect. These results suggest that the intercalation of genistein and estradiol into DNA may alter the DNA structural integrity, interrupt the production of oxidizing species, and subsequently reduce the formation of 8-OHdG by UV radiation.
TI  - Examination for heat-labile, heat-stable, and Shiga-like toxins and for the eaeA  gene in Escherichia coli isolates obtained from dogs dying with diarrhea: 122 cases (1992-1996).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine Escherichia coli isolates obtained from dogs dying with diarrhea for heat-labile, heat-stable, and Shiga-like toxins and for the eaeA gene, which is associated with attaching and effacing lesions. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 122 dogs. PROCEDURE: E coli isolates were tested by means of dot-blot hybridization of DNA extracts of cultured bacteria. Medical records of dogs from which E coli isolates with virulence genes had been isolated were examined, and histologic findings and evidence of intercurrent bacterial and viral infections were recorded. RESULTS: None of the E coli isolates obtained from these dogs produced heat-labile, heat-stable, or Shiga-like toxins; however, E coli isolates from 44 of 122 dogs were found to have the eaeA gene. Histologically, multifocal bacterial adherence to the epithelium and epithelial necrosis and detachment were seen in colonic specimens from 20 of 44 (45%) dogs. Escherichia coli was the sole pathogen identified in 15 of 44 (34%) dogs. Intercurrent pathogens, including canine parvovirus (n = 19), Clostridium perfringens (8), rotavirus (5), hookworms (3), coccidia (3), and Salmonella agona (1), were identified in the remaining 29 (66%) dogs. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Attaching and effacing E coli can be a primary or secondary pathogen in dogs with diarrhea. Antibiotic treatment is indicated in dogs with diarrhea because of the possibility that it is primarily bacterial in origin and because, even if it is primarily viral in origin, there may be secondary bacterial infection.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in the fecal flora of healthy cats after dietary supplementation with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). ANIMALS: 12 healthy, barrier-maintained, specific-pathogen-free-derived adult cats. PROCEDURE: Fresh fecal samples for quantitative and qualitative bacteriologic examination were collected from each cat after ingestion of a replete dry (basal) diet for a minimum of 8 weeks. The diet was then supplemented with 0.75% FOS, and another fecal sample was collected after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD fecal aerobic, anaerobic, and total bacterial counts (log10 colony-forming units per gram of feces [CFU/g]) did not differ significantly between diets (8.3 +/- 0.8, 9.2 +/- 0.6, 9.4 +/- 0.4, respectively, for the basal diet; and 8.4 +/- 0.8, 9.7 +/- 0.7, and 9.8 +/- 0.7, respectively, for the FOS diet), although there was a trend for higher numbers of anaerobes and total bacteria associated with the FOS diet. Members of the genus Bacteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, lactobacilli, and Plesiomonas shigeloides were the most prevalent bacteria isolated. Compared with samples from cats fed basal diet, there was a trend for increased mean counts of lactobacilli (P = 0.02) and Bacteroides spp (P = 0.05) after FOS supplementation, and a trend for decreased mean numbers of Escherichia coli (P = 0.03) and Clostridium perfringens (P = 0.08) to be associated with the FOS diet. Supplementation of FOS resulted in a median 164-fold increase in numbers of lactobacilli, 13.2-fold increase in Bacteroides spp, 98% reduction in numbers of C perfringens, and 75% reduction in numbers of E coli. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of the diet with FOS resulted in alteration of the fecal flora of cats.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of RP4-oriT shuttle vectors from Escherichia coli to Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A chromosomally integrated copy of the IncP plasmid RP4 was shown to mediate the  conjugative transfer of shuttle plasmids containing an oriT site from Escherichia coli to the anaerobic pathogen Clostridium perfringens. Two versatile shuttle plasmids, pJIR1456 and pJIR1457, which will be invaluable for the introduction of cloned genes into C. perfringens, were constructed.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the acylneuraminate lyase gene from Clostridium perfringens A99.
AB  - The acylneuraminate lyase gene from Clostridium perfringens A99 was cloned on a 3.3 kb HindIII DNA fragment identified by screening the chromosomal DNA of this species by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe that had been deduced from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein, and another probe directed against a region that is conserved in the acylneuraminate lyase gene of Escherichia coli and in the putative gene of Clostridium tertium. After cloning, three of the recombinant clones expressed lyase activity above the background of the endogenous enzyme of the E. coli host. The sequenced part of the cloned fragment contains the complete acylneuraminate lyase gene (ORF2) of 864 bp that encodes 288 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 32.3 kDa. The lyase structural gene follows a noncoding region with an inverted repeat and a ribosome binding site. Upstream from this regulatory region another open reading frame (ORF1) was detected. The 3'-terminus of the lyase structural gene is followed by a further ORF (ORF3). A high homology was found between the amino acid sequences of the sialate lyases from Clostridium perfringens and Haemophilus influenzae (75% identical amino acids) or Trichomonas vaginalis (69% identical amino acids), respectively, whereas the similarity to the gene from E. coli is low (38% identical amino acids). Based on our new sequence data, the 'large' sialidase gene and the lyase gene of C. perfringens are not arranged next to each other on the chromosome of this species.
TI  - Production of a non-toxic site-directed mutant of Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin which induces protective immunity in mice.
AB  - A panel of ten site-directed mutants of Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin was generated. All of the mutated proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were recognized in immunoblots by a neutralizing mAb raised against wild-type native epsilon-toxin. The cytotoxicity of the site-directed mutated toxins was assayed in vitro against MDCK cells. One mutation resulting in loss of activity in the assay was identified. This non-toxic protein was derived by substituting a proline for the histidine at residue 106 of the toxin. Immunization of mice with the non-toxic mutated epsilon-toxin resulted in the induction of a specific antibody response and immunized mice were protected against 1000 LD50 doses of wild-type recombinant epsilon-toxin.
TI  - Tn4451 from Clostridium perfringens is a mobilizable transposon that encodes the  functional Mob protein, TnpZ.
AB  - The 6.3 kb Clostridium perfringens transposon Tn4451 encodes a 50 kDa protein, TnpZ, which has amino acid sequence similarity to a group of plasmid mobilization and recombination proteins that comprise the Mob/Pre family. Members of this family interact with an upstream palindromic sequence called an RSA site, and an RSA-like sequence has been identified upstream of the tnpZ gene. In Escherichia coli, in the presence of a chromosomally integrated derivative of the broad-host-range IncP plasmid, RP4, TnpZ was able to promote plasmid mobilization in cis and was able to function in trans to enable the mobilization of a co-resident plasmid carrying an RSA site. It was also able to mediate the conjugative transfer of plasmids from E. coli to C. perfringens. Site-directed mutagenesis of two bases within the RSA site resulted in a significant reduction in mobilization frequency, demonstrating that the RSA site is required for efficient plasmid mobilization. TnpZ is the only Mob/Pre protein known to be associated with a transposable genetic element, and Tn4451 is the first mobilizable but non-self-transmissible transposon to be identified from a gram-positive bacterium.
TI  - Regulated transcription of Clostridium difficile toxin genes.
AB  - The Clostridium difficile toxA and toxB genes, encoding cytotoxic and enterotoxic proteins responsible for antibiotic-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis, were shown to be transcribed both from gene-specific promoters and from promoters of upstream genes. However, the gene-specific transcripts represented the majority of tox gene mRNAs. The 5' ends of these mRNAs were shown to correspond to DNA sequences that had promoter activity when fused to the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (gusA) gene and introduced into C. perfringens. The appearance of tox mRNA in C. difficile was repressed during exponential growth phase but increased substantially as cells entered stationary phase. When glucose or other rapidly metabolizable sugars were present in the medium, the stationary phase-associated induction was inhibited, indicating that the toxin genes are subject to a form of catabolite repression. This glucose effect was general to many toxinogenic strains having varying levels of toxin production.
TI  - Second-site suppressor mutations for the Arg70 substitution mutants of the Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The positive charge of the Arg70 residue in the cytoplasmic loop of the Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (Tet(B)) of Escherichia coli is essential for the tetracycline transport function (Y. Someya and A. Yamaguchi, Biochemistry 35, 9385-9391 (1996)). In this study, we found that the R70A mutation was suppressed by the second-site mutation of Thr171 to Ser. The T171S mutation suppressed any mutations at position 70 regardless of the amino acid residue introduced. The R70A and R70C mutations were also suppressed by the T171A or T171C mutations, but not by the T171Y mutation, indicating that the decrease in the side chain volume at position 171 is essential for the suppression. Tetracycline transport activity of the R70C mutant was stimulated by Hg2+ because mercaptide formed between the SH group of Cys70 and Hg2+ worked as a functional positively-charged side chain. The activity of the R70A/R71C/T171S mutant was also stimulated by Hg2+, whereas those of the R70A/R71C, R71C, and R71C/T171S mutants were not, indicating that the T171S mutation causes the switching of the functional positive charge at position 70 to 71. Since Thr171 is in the middle of the transmembrane helix VI, the switching may be based on a remote conformational effect.
TI  - Characterization of the interaction between VP8 of bovine rotavirus C486 and cellular components on MA-104 cells and erythrocytes.
AB  - Rotavirus VP8*, the N-terminal trypsin cleavage product of VP4, has been shown to bind to MA-104 cells and human O type erythrocytes. To examine whether bacterially expressed VP8* binds to cellular components of MA-104 cells, the VP8* (aa 1-247) was expressed in E. coli and radiolabelled with 35S-methionine. The radiolabelled rVP8* was immunoprecipitated with antiserum to bovine rotavirus C486 (BRV). The rVP8* was found to bind to MA-104 cells and its binding was competed by BRV. To study the interaction between VP8* and receptors of erythrocytes, hemagglutination (HA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were carried out using solubilized rVP8*. rVP8* showed HA which could be inhibited by antiserum to BRV. This interaction was also inhibited by gangliosides, demonstrating a sialic acid dependent interaction. To study the contribution of the C-terminal region of VP8* to HA, a number of approaches were used. First, a peptide spanning aa 230-247 was synthesized and antisera was raised against the peptide to see whether it could inhibit HA of rVP8*. Second, a truncated form of VP8* (tVP8*: aa 1-229) was expressed to examine its hemagglutinating activity. Third, the dimerization of rVP8* and tVP8* was compared by Western-blotting following electrophoresis using native SDS-PAGE. The results indicated that antibody to aa 230-247 inhibits hemagglutination by preventing dimerization of VP8* which in turn allows the molecule to cause HA. To characterize the interaction between the HA domain and sialic acid receptors, erythrocytes were treated with sialidases of different specificities. Arthrobacter ureafaciens, Clostridium perfringens and alpha 2-8 linkage-specific neuraminidase destroyed the ability of sialic acid of erythrocytes to interact with rVP8*, indicating that bovine rotavirus C486 binding requires an alpha 2-8 linkage but acetylation of the sialic acid is not necessary.
TI  - Identification and characterization of sporulation-dependent promoters upstream of the enterotoxin gene (cpe) of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Three promoter sites (P1, P2, and P3) responsible for the sporulation-associated  synthesis of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, a common cause of food poisoning in humans and animals, were identified. Nested and internal deletions of the cpe promoter region were made to narrow down the location of promoter elements. To measure the effects of the deletions on the expression of cpe, translational fusions containing the promoter deletions were made with the gusA gene of Escherichia coli, which codes for beta-glucuronidase; E. coli-C. perfringens shuttle vectors carrying the fusions were introduced into C. perfringens by electroporation. In addition, in vitro transcription assays were performed with the cpe promoter region as the DNA template for extracts made from sporulating cells. DNA sequences upstream of P1 were similar to consensus SigK-dependent promoters, while P2 and P3 were similar to consensus SigE-dependent promoters. SigE and SigK are sporulation-associated sigma factors known to be active in the mother cell compartment of sporulating cells of Bacillus subtilis, the same compartment in which enterotoxin is synthesized in C. perfringens.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of AM-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of AM-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Although AM-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (MIC90s > or =3.13 mg/mL), 76% of the B. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at AM-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/L. AM-1155 was highly active against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90s < or =0.39 mg/L). An in-vivo study using a mixed infection with AM-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible B. fragilis and Escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. AM-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against E. coli. These results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of AM-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. Clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in AM-1155-treated mice. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of AM-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the B. fragilis group and P. bivia should be evaluated further.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. This compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite R-95867. The antibacterial activity of R-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. R-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. Its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the bacterial species tested. R-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, Clostridium perfringens, Neisseria spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). R-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Bacteroides fragilis. R-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of S. aureus and 1Bs, 2, 3, and 4 of E. coli had high affinities for R-95867. The in vivo efficacy of CS-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. The efficacy of CS-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris. Among the drugs tested, CS-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Glutamate residues located within putative transmembrane helices are essential for TetA(P)-mediated tetracycline efflux.
AB  - The tetA(P) gene from Clostridium perfringens encodes a unique membrane protein that is responsible for the active efflux of tetracycline from resistant cells. The novel TetA(P) protein has neither the typical structure nor the conserved motifs that are found in tetracycline efflux proteins from classes A through H or classes K and L. Site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues within TetA(P) was performed to elucidate their role in tetracycline efflux. Glutamate residues 52 and 59, negatively charged residues located within putative transmembrane helix 2, could not be replaced by either glutamine or aspartate and so were essential for tetracycline efflux. Replacement of Glu89, which was located at the end of helix 3, by aspartate but not by glutamine allowed TetA(P) function, indicating the importance of a carboxyl group at this position. After mutation of the Asp67 residue, located within cytoplasmic loop 1, no immunoreactive protein was detected. It is concluded that negatively charged residues that appear to be located within or near the membrane are important for the function of TetA(P).
TI  - Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in a dairy cow.
AB  - A 9-year-old Holstein cow was evaluated for colic and decreased milk production of 2 days' duration. Preoperative serum biochemical results suggested hepatic damage and cholestasis. On the basis of persistent signs of abdominal pain that were nonresponsive to analgesics, exploratory laparotomy was performed. The cow was found to have choleliths. Cholecystocentesis was performed, and samples were submitted for cytologic examination and bacterial culture. Bacterial culture yielded Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. Using digital pressure, choleliths were reduced until they could be passed through the bile duct into the duodenum. The cow recovered from surgery without complications, and all serum biochemical test results returned to reference ranges. Cholelithiasis is rare in cattle but can result in signs of abdominal pain.
TI  - Effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  - The effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and DNA adducts in the rat colon was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of AOM at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. The number of ACF five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of L. acidophilus and C. perfringens. The half-life of O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) in the L. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the GAM broth group. The half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. These results suggest that the metabolite(s) of L. acidophilus and C. perfringens inhibit(s) the ACF formation in rats treated with AOM and that the inhibitory effect of L. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of O6-meG from the colon mucosal DNA.
TI  - Oral tolerance to ovalbumin in mice: induction and long-term persistence unaffected by Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B and Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin.
AB  - Oral administration of dietary antigen (Ag) results in the systemic Ag-specific immunologic unresponsiveness termed oral tolerance. Its induction is of importance in the young where numerous symptoms are associated with IgE-mediated food-hypersensitivity reactions. Two related enterotoxins, cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, have been shown to abrogate oral tolerance (i.e. IgG and IgE antibody (Ab) unresponsiveness) to an unrelated and simultaneously fed Ag. However, a critical role has been suggested for the gut flora in recovery of a hyporesponsive state. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) and Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin (CPE), involved in many diarrheas, could affect the induction and long-term persistence of oral tolerance to ovalbumin (OVA). Using conventional and germ-free mice fed once or twice with enterotoxin plus OVA, we investigated the possible role of the indigenous gut flora. In addition, we tested the influence of CPE synthesized in vivo in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice on the induction of OVA-specific oral tolerance. Mice were immunized intraperitoneally with OVA twice, and IgG and IgE Ab levels were measured by ELISA. Neither SEB nor CPE, orally given or synthesized in vivo (CPE), prevented the induction of oral tolerance to OVA. Moreover, the IgG Ab unresponsiveness persisted over 2 mo in the conventional mice fed with toxin plus OVA as also observed in the OVA controls. The results indicate that, independent of the gut flora's influence, SEB and CPE did not affect the induction nad long-term persistence of oral tolerance to co-ingested Ag.
TI  - Public health hazards from small ruminant meat products in Europe.
AB  - Foodborne diseases, in particular those related to meat and meat products, have recently become a matter of great public concern. Sheep and goat meat can transmit infections and diseases either through handling during preparation procedures or as a result of ingestion by the consumer. The authors highlight the second route of contamination in relation to meat and meat products from small ruminants in European countries. Among the most important diseases transmitted by mutton and goat meat, toxoplasmosis remains the greatest threat, particularly in immuno-compromised people and in pregnant women. Other pathogens which may be associated with the consumption of meat from small ruminants include: Clostridium perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum and Campylobacter jejuni. As with other ruminant species, Escherichia coli O157:H7 can be considered as an emerging pathogen, for which control efforts must be made. The classical zoonoses (brucellosis, Q fever, hydatidosis) are also presented here, although the major source of contamination for these diseases remains contact with infected animals or the handling of carcasses. The fact that the association of foodborne diseases with mutton and goat meat is less frequent than with the meat of other animal species should be noted, for the following reasons: a) lower levels of production; b) less intensive production, leading to a weaker microbial contamination; c) mutton and goat meat are subjected to processing less often than other meats; d) the usual boiling or cooking processes.
TI  - Meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  - The authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the United States of America (USA) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. Cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the USA, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. The potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include Salmonella (with special attention to S. Typhimurium DT104), Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas spp. In conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.
TI  - Influence of various bile salts on beta-glucuronidase activity of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - While the decrease of the beta-glucuronidase activity of sonicated cells of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli was obvious for sodium deoxycholate (DC), it was not so obvious for other bile salts (sodium glycocholate and sodium cholate). The enzyme activity of intact cells of these bacteria was significantly enhanced by the presence of DC, but not by the other bile salts in the buffer. These results suggest that the permeability of the bacterial cells is increased more by the presence of DC than by other bile salts.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - The effect of enteric bacterial toxins on the catecholamine levels of the rabbit.
AB  - The rabbit catecholamine responses to bacterial toxins commonly found in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) victims were studied as part of a proposed animal model for SIDS. Six bacterial toxins commonly isolated from SIDS baby feces and a comparison endotoxin were injected intravenously (i.v.) and intraluminarily (i.l.) to determine their effects on catecholamine levels. I.v. injected toxins clearly altered catecholamine levels causing sharp rises in adrenaline and noradrenaline levels and at critical toxin concentrations sudden death ensued. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and alpha-toxin, Clostridium difficile enterotoxin (A) and cytotoxin (B), Escherichia coli STa toxin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B caused rises in catecholamine levels similar to that caused by E. coli endotoxin. Control rabbits showed very little or no obvious change in catecholamine levels. Clostridium difficile enterotoxin (A) and cytotoxin (B) injected i.v. exhibited synergy. Toxins injected into the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and large intestine caused behavioural changes ranging from reduced appetite and diarrhea to, in rare cases, death. Changes in the catecholamine levels of these animals however were not significantly different from those of the control animals. The results are discussed in relation to the possible effect of certain conditions (physiological, viral infections and environmental) which increase toxin permeability and allow absorption of these toxins, possibly resulting in sudden infant death.
TI  - The resolvase/invertase domain of the site-specific recombinase TnpX is functional and recognizes a target sequence that resembles the junction of the circular form of the Clostridium perfringens transposon Tn4451.
AB  - Tn4451 is a 6.3-kb chloramphenicol resistance transposon from Clostridium perfringens and is found on the conjugative plasmid pIP401. The element undergoes spontaneous excision from multicopy plasmids in Escherichia coli and C. perfringens and conjugative excision from pIP401 in C. perfringens. Tn4451 is excised as a circular molecule which is probably the transposition intermediate. Excision of Tn4451 is dependent upon the site-specific recombinase TnpX, which contains potential motifs associated with both the resolvase/invertase and integrase families of recombinases. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues within these domains was used to show that the resolvase/invertase domain was essential for TnpX-mediated excision of Tn4451 from multicopy plasmids in E. coli. An analysis of Tn4451 target sites revealed that the transposition process showed target site specificity. The Tn4451 target sequence resembled the junction of the circular form, and insertion occurred at a GA dinucleotide. Tn4451 insertions were flanked by directly repeated GA dinucleotides, and there was also a GA at the junction of the circular form, where the left and right termini of Tn4451 were fused. We propose a model for Tn4451 excision and insertion in which the resolvase/invertase domain of TnpX introduces 2-bp staggered cuts at these GA dinucleotides. Analysis of Tn4451 derivatives with altered GA dinucleotides provided experimental evidence to support the model.
TI  - Neutralization of hemolytic and mouse lethal activities of C. perfringens alpha-toxin need simultaneous blockade of two epitopes by monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs 3B4, 1E8, 1F9) were produced by fusion of X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells and splenocytes of mice immunized with glutaraldehyde-inactivated alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens. All MAbs belonged to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class and possessed a kappa light chain. All the MAbs were specific for alpha-toxin of C. perfringens as demonstrated by immunoblotting experiments performed with culture supernatants of C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. sordellii, and Bacillus cereus. Competition analysis in an ELISA revealed that the MAbs recognized different epitopes on the alpha-toxin molecule. In an immunoblot assay based on a recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli, the binding site of MAb 1E8 but not those of MAbs 3B4 and 1 F9 were mapped to the COOH-terminal fragment of alpha-toxin (aa 248-370). To prove the neutralizing potential of the MAbs, alpha-toxin was preincubated with MAbs and subsequently tested for its lecithinase activity in an egg yolk diffusion turbidity (EYDT) assay, its hemolytic activity in a hemolysis test, and its lethal effect on mice after intraperitoneally administration. When the MAbs were tested individually, neutralization was only seen in the EYDT assay, where MAb 3B4 completely abolished the lecithinase activity of alpha toxin. However, when MAbs 3B4 and 1 E8 were used in combination, they acted synergistically and inhibited the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes in vitro. The same mixture of MAbs was also able to completely neutralize the lethal effect of three LD50 of alpha-toxin on Balb/c mice. Our results suggest that the alpha-toxin molecule contains several domains which are differently involved in the various activities of the toxin. We conclude that the hemolytic domain(s) of alpha-toxin is (are) identical with or very closely located to the domain(s) that cause the mouse lethal effect. The lecithinase activity may be involved in the mechanisms of hemolysis and mouse lethality but appears not to be the only determinant.
TI  - Microbiological composition of raw milk from selected farms in the Camembert region of Normandy.
AB  - Raw milk from 27 farms was sampled over 6 months for listerias, salmonellas, Yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacters. Total bacterial counts and somatic cell counts were measured. Lactococci, lactobacilli, dextran-producing leuconostocs, Brevibacterium linens, yeasts and moulds, Staphylococcus aureus and other Micrococcaceae, Pseudomonas, coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and spores of anaerobic lactate-fermenting bacteria were also counted. Pseudomonas (2000 cfu ml-1), lactococci (760 cfu ml-1) and Micrococcaceae (720 cfu ml-1) were the most numerous groups. Lactic acid bacteria were detected in all samples. Coliforms were present in most samples, but 84% of samples had counts < 100 cfu ml-1. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 62% of milks, the average count was 410 cfu ml-1. About 80% of supplies had < or = 10 E. coli cfu ml-1 and all samples had < or = 1 Cl. perfringens cfu ml-1. Two of the tested milks were positive for salmonellas (2.9%), four were positive for Listeria monocytogenes (5.8%), 25 for Yersinia enterocolitica (36%) and one for campylobacters (1.4%).
TI  - Remote conformational effects of the Gly-62 --> Leu mutation of the Tn10-encoded  metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli and its second-site suppressor mutation.
AB  - Substitution of Gly-62 of the Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter caused a functional defect corresponding to the volume of the substituent [Yamaguchi, A., Someya, Y., and Sawai, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19155-19162]. A spontaneous revertant exhibiting tetracycline resistance was isolated from Escherichia coli cells carrying the tetA(B) gene encoding the G62L mutation. The revertant showed a second-site mutation at codon 30 of TTA (Leu) to TCA (Ser). Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the L30S mutation could suppress the effects of the G62A, G62C, G62N, and G62V mutations as well as the G62L mutation. Positions 62 and 30 are located in hydrophilic loops estimated to be in the cytoplasm and periplasm, respectively. Their sidedness was confirmed by the fact that, in intact cells, the [14C]N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) binding to the G62C mutant was not affected by preincubation with a membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent, whereas the binding to the L30C mutant was blocked by the reagent. The reactivity of the L30C and L29C mutants with [14C]NEM was drastically decreased when Gly-62 was replaced by Leu, indicating that the residues around position 30 became embedded in the intramembrane region due to the remote conformational effect of the G62L mutation across the membrane. Moreover, the reactivity of the L29C/G62L mutant with [14C]NEM was restored with the L30S mutation. These results clearly indicate that the second-site suppression by the L30S mutation was based on the blocking of the remote conformational change around position 30 across the cell membrane caused by the G62L mutation.
TI  - The effect of in vitro bacterial association on virulence of Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - When trophozoites of axenic E. histolytica strains NIH : 200 were associated in vitro with Escherichia coli K12 for three hours at 37 degrees C, the virulence was enhanced as shown by increased cytopathogenicity to baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell monolayer. Further, the trophozoites were observed to adhere to the polystyrene surface, a hitherto unreported phenomenon. The co-association of E. histolytica trophozoites with Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens for three hours duration at 37 degrees C neither led to increase in cytotoxicity potential nor to adherence phenomenon; in contrast significant inhibition of cytotoxicity was observed. We have thus shown that while co-association of E. histolytica (NIH : 200) with E. coli K12 leads to enhanced amoebic virulence, that with anaerobic bacteric leads to its inhibition.
TI  - Laparoscopy and septic dissemination caused by perioperative perforation of the occluded small bowel: an experimental study.
AB  - Based on the observation of septic shock and severe respiratory impairment in two patients subjected to laparoscopic surgery for small bowel occlusion, an experimental study was carried out in rabbits to evaluate the effect of intra-abdominal CO2 hyperpressure on massive bacterial spread. Increased bacterial access to the blood was observed as a result of the mechanical effect of the hyperpressure associated with the highly septic contents of the occluded bowel. The important risk of bacterial dissemination following accidental peroperative perforation requires extreme caution in the laparoscopic management of late occlusions of the small intestine.
TI  - The Helicobacter pylori ureC gene codes for a phosphoglucosamine mutase.
AB  - The function of UreC, the product of a 1,335-bp-long open reading frame upstream  from the urease structural genes (ureAB) of Helicobacter pylori, was investigated. We present data showing that the ureC gene product is a phosphoglucosamine mutase. D. Mengin-Lecreulx and J. van Heijenoort (J. Biol. Chem. 271:32-39, 1996) observed that UreC is similar (43% identity) to the GlmM protein of Escherichia coli. Those authors showed that GlmM is a phosphoglucosamine mutase catalyzing interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently transformed into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The latter product is one of the main cytoplasmic precursors of cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharides. The present paper reports that, like its E. coli homolog glmM, the H. pylori ureC gene is essential for cell growth. It was known that growth of a lethal conditional glmM mutant of E. coli at a nonpermissive temperature can be restored in the presence of the ureC gene. We showed that complete complementation of the glmM mutant can be obtained with a plasmid overproducing UreC. The peptidoglycan content and the specific phosphoglucosamine mutase activity of such a complemented strain were measured; these results demonstrated that the ureC gene product functions as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. Homologs of the UreC and GlmM proteins were identified in Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium leprae, Clostridium perfringens, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, and Methanococcus jannaschii. Significant conservation of the amino acid sequence of these proteins in such diverse organisms suggests a very ancient common ancestor for the genes and defines a consensus motif for the phosphoglucosamine mutase active site. We propose renaming the H. pylori ureC gene the glmM gene.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a germination-specific muramidase from Clostridium  perfringens S40 spores and nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene.
AB  - The exudate of fully germinated spores of Clostridium perfringens S40 in 0.15 M KCI-50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) was found to contain another spore-lytic enzyme in addition to the germination-specific amidase previously characterized (S. Miyata, R. Moriyama, N. Miyahara, and S. Makino, Microbiology 141:2643-2650, 1995). The lytic enzyme was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and shown to be a muramidase which requires divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+) for its activity. The enzyme was inactivated by sulfhydryl reagents, and sodium thioglycolate reversed the inactivation by Hg2+. The muramidase hydrolyzed isolated spore cortical fragments from a variety of wild-type organisms but had minimal activity on decoated spores and isolated cell walls. However, the enzyme was not capable of digesting isolated cortical fragments from spores of Bacillus subtilis ADD1, which lacks muramic acid delta-lactam in its cortical peptidoglycan. This indicates that the enzyme recognizes the delta-lactam residue peculiar to spore peptidoglycan, suggesting an involvement of the enzyme in spore germination. Immunochemical studies indicated that the muramidase in its mature form is localized on the exterior of the cortex layer in the dormant spore. A gene encoding the muramidase, sleM, was cloned into Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene encoded a protein of 321 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 36,358. The deduced amino acid sequence of the sleM gene indicated that the enzyme is produced in a mature form. It was suggested that the muramidase belongs to a separate group within the lysozyme family typified by the fungus Chalaropsis lysozyme. A possible mechanism for cortex degradation in C. perfringens S40 spores is discussed.
TI  - Small neuraminidase gene of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 10543: cloning, nucleotide sequence, and production.
AB  - The small nanH gene encoding a neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens ATCC 10543 was cloned in JM109 using pUC19 as a vector. Sequence analysis revealed an ORF, nt 310-1455, encoding 382 amino acids that was proceeded by a typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence, GGACGAGA. The nt sequence in the 15-402 region had in vivo promoter activity in an Escherichia coli promoter probe plasmid pKK232-8, which suggested that the small nanH promoter is functional in E. coli. Four regions of amino acids demonstrated great similarity to the "Asp boxes" (-Ser-X-Asp-X-Gly-X-Thr-Trp-) of other bacterial nanH proteins. The small nanH expressing clone, pCPN-1, which was cultured under aerobic conditions resulted in NanH activity which was 203-fold in culture and 211-fold in intracellular fraction compared to that of C. perfringens which has to be cultured under anaerobic conditions. Production of small NanH was also induced by adding sialyllactose to the culture medium of JM109 [pCPN-1]. The enzyme activity could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and the culture medium of JM109 [pCPN-1] after culturing to the stationary phase. The molecular weight, K(m), and optimum pH and pI of the cloned enzyme are identical to those of the parent strain. The cloned, small nanH could be used to study the structure-functional relationship of nanH, while the pCPN-1 clone could be used in the aerobic production of neuraminidase.
TI  - Development of selected faecal microfloras and of phagocytic and killing capacity of neutrophils in young pigs.
AB  - Nine healthy piglets, weaned at the age of 35 days and emanating from two litters, were studied from 7 to 63 days of age. The development of their faecal flora was analysed by bacteriological quantification of coliforms, E. coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. The numbers of coliforms, E. coli and enterococci decreased from about 10(8) CFU/g faeces on day 7 to about 10(5) at the end of the study. Clostridium perfringens, with an initial value of 10(4) CFU/g faeces, was not found in any faecal sample from day 21 onwards. At each sampling occasion the similarity between the floras of different pigs were investigated by biochemical fingerprinting and calculated as correlation coefficients between metabolic fingerprints. This was performed for the coliform and the enterococcal floras. Initially, the coliform floras had a low homogeneity (rmean = 0.6), indicating large initial differences between the piglets. From day 14 post-partum until weaning the homogeneity was stable at a high level (rmean = 0.9). On day 3 post-weaning a marked decrease of the homogeneity was seen (rmean = 0.5), which later returned to the level before weaning. The enterococcal floras had a high homogeneity (rmean = 0.8-0.9) through the study and was only slightly affected by weaning. The function and development of the phagocytic and killing capacity of neutrophil granulocytes was monitored by flow cytometry and chemiluminescence. No changes in these functions were seen over time or between litters.
TI  - The recA gene from Clostridium perfringens is induced by methyl methanesulphonate and contains an upstream Cheo box.
AB  - The recA gene from Clostridium perfringens was cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from conserved regions of RecA proteins from other bacteria. The 1089 bp gene encoded a putative RecA protein with 69% amino acid sequence similarity to the RecA protein from Bacillus subtilis. The C. perfringens recA gene was induced by exposure to methyl methanesulphonate and complemented a recA mutant of Escherichia coli. A cheo box was identified in the region upstream of the gene. Since this SOS-like operator site is conserved in many DNA-damage-inducible recA gene regions from Gram-positive bacteria, the results suggest that the regulation of the C. perfringens recA gene also involves the binding of a LexA-like protein to this site.
TI  - Deletion analysis of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin.
AB  - To further our knowledge of the structure-function relationship and mechanism of  action of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), a series of recombinant CPE (rCPE) species containing N- and C-terminal CPE deletion fragments was constructed by recombinant DNA approaches. Each rCPE species was characterized for its ability to complete the first four early steps in the action of CPE, putatively ordered as specific binding, a postbinding physical change to bound CPE, large-complex formation, and induction of alterations in small-molecule membrane permeability. These studies demonstrated that (i) at least 44 amino acids can be removed from the N terminus of CPE without loss of cytotoxicity, (ii) removal of the first 53 amino acids from the N terminus of CPE produces a fragment that appears to be noncytotoxic because it cannot undergo the post-binding physical change step in CPE action, (iii) removal of as few as five amino acids from the C terminus of CPE produces a noncytotoxic fragment lacking receptor binding activity, and (iv) a fragment lacking the first 44 N-terminal amino acids of native CPE formed twice as much large complex and was twice as cytotoxic as native CPE. From these structure-function results, it appears that the minimum-size cytotoxic CPE fragment comprises approximately residues 45 to 319 of native CPE. Results from these deletion fragment studies have also contributed to our understanding of CPE action by (i) independently supporting previous suggestions that binding, the postbinding physical change step, and large-complex formation represent important steps in CPE cytotoxicity and (ii) providing independent evidence confirming the putative sequential order of these early events in CPE action.
TI  - Structure and mechanism of a sub-family of enzymes related to N-acetylneuraminate lyase.
AB  - We describe here a sub-family of enzymes related both structurally and functionally to N-acetylneuraminate lyase. Two members of this family (N-acetylneuraminate lyase and dihydrodipicolinate synthase) have known three-dimensional structures and we now proceed to show their structural and functional relationship to two further proteins, trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase and D-4-deoxy-5-oxoglucarate dehydratase. These enzymes are all thought to involve intermediate Schiff-base formation with their respective substrates. In order to understand the nature of this intermediate, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of N-acetylneuraminate lyase in complex with hydroxypyruvate (a product analogue) and in complex with one of its products (pyruvate). From these structures we deduce the presence of a closely similar Schiff-base forming motif in all members of the N-acetylneuraminate lyase sub-family. A fifth protein, MosA, is also confirmed to be a member of the sub-family although the involvement of an intermediate Schiff-base in its proposed reaction is unclear.
TI  - Economic costs and trade impacts of microbial foodborne illness.
AB  - This article presents the economic costs of foodborne diseases for selected countries, the approaches used to calculate these costs, and a discussion on the interaction between microbial food safety issues and international trade in food. The human illness costs due to foodborne pathogens are estimated most completely in the United States of America, where, each year, 7 foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7. Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Toxoplasma gondii) cause an estimated 3.3-12.3 million cases of foodborne illness and up to 3900 deaths. These 7 pathogens are found in animal products and cost the United States an estimated $6.5-$34.9 billion (1995 US$) annually. The presence of foodborne pathogens in a country's food supply not only affects the health of the local population, but also represents a potential for spread to pathogens to visitors to the country and to consumers in countries which import food products. With more complete data on foodborne illnesses, deaths, costs and international trade rejections in each country, indicators could be developed by which changes in food safety can be monitored.
TI  - Safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  - The revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. Due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. Epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. The organisms involved are Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens and Aeromonas spp. Contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level. In terms of the critical control point approach of the HACCP concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. To guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.
TI  - Natural protection of spring and well drinking water against surface microbial contamination. II. Indicators and monitoring parameters for parasites.
AB  - Recent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and reports of other newly described para-sitic diseases associated with drinking water transmission prompted a reevaluation of source water monitoring criteria for public health protection. The field of microbial indicators was reviewed and each candidate sentinel evaluated in terms of its sensitivity, specificity, and technical feasibility. In addition, a clear distinction was made between source water monitoring and monitoring in the distribution system. Of all potential candidate microbial sentinels, Escherichia coli is deemed the most efficacious for public health protection. Based on a conservative estimate of its half-life in groundwater for 8 d, it is recommended that at least two samples be obtained during this half-life. In addition to E. coli, two water quality indicator sentinels, which are not necessarily direct public health threats, should also be monitored at the same frequency. These are the total coliform group and the enterococci. If E. coli is present in any source water sample, the borehole and any directly connected borehole should be embargoed. If either total coliforms or enterococci are detected, only that individual borehole should be taken off line and not used until the situation is remediated and the cause of the fecal contamination eliminated. Clostridium perfringens spores serve as a useful long-lived indicator. However, their perseverance in a sample should not be considered a direct public health threat because spores may far outlive pathogens. As a parasite indicator, C. perfringens should have the same importance as a positive coliform or enterococcus analysis. Coliphages do not yet fulfill enough of the criteria to be routinely employed. Biological monitoring should be coupled with physicochemical monitoring to establish a long-term history of the source. Because all natural waters vary in the amounts of heterotrophic plate count bacteria, test methods should be employed that are refractory to them. A combination of rigorous source protection plus extraordinary source monitoring serve as sufficient multiple barriers for parasite protection.
TI  - Intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. Toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. There are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. Heat labile toxins are produced by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by Escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. Similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the United States, and Yersenia enterocolitica. Protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. For example the Shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. Intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by Escherichia coli, and Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins are presented.
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - Rubrerythrin from Clostridium perfringens: cloning of the gene, purification of the protein, and characterization of its superoxide dismutase function.
AB  - The food-borne pathogen Clostridium perfringens, which is an obligate anaerobe, showed growth under conditions of oxidative stress. In protein extracts we looked for superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities which might scavenge highly toxic superoxide radicals evolving under such stress conditions. Using the classical assay to detect SOD activity on gels after electrophoresis of C. perfringens proteins, we obtained a pattern of three major bands indicating SOD activity. The protein representing the brightest band was purified by three chromatographic steps. On the basis of 20 amino acids determined from the N terminus of the protein, we designed a degenerate oligonucleotide probe to isolate the corresponding gene. We finally sequenced an open reading frame of 195 amino acids (molecular mass, 21,159 Da) with a strong homology to the Desulfovibrio vulgaris rubrerythrin; therefore, we assumed to have cloned a rubrerythrin gene from C. perfringens, and we named it rbr. The C-terminal region of the newly detected rubrerythrin from C. perfringens contains a characteristic non-heme, non-sulfur iron-binding site -Cys-X-X-Cys-(X)12-Cys-X-X-Cys- similar to that found in rubrerythrin from D. vulgaris. In addition, three -Glu-X-X-His- sequences could represent diiron binding domains. We observed SOD activity in extracts of Escherichia coli strains containing the recombinant rbr gene from C. perfringens. A biological function of rubrerythrin as SOD was confirmed with the functional complementation by the rbr gene of an E. coli mutant strain lacking SOD activity. We therefore suppose that rubrerythrin plays a role as a scavenger of oxygen radicals.
TI  - Microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  - Possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. In the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. To date, various bacterial species have been reported, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and Clostridium perfringens. Infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. Antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. The purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). A total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between February of 1993 and July of 1994 at the UCLA Medical Center. The implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and Dacron (6 percent). The implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). Of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. Forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then Escherichia coli (1.5 percent). No fungal infections were identified. Culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. The frequency (47 percent) and types (P. acnes and S. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.
TI  - Contribution of individual tryptophan residues to the structure and activity of theta-toxin (perfringolysin O), a cholesterol-binding cytolysin.
AB  - theta-Toxin (perfringolysin O), secreted by Clostridium perfringens, shares with  other known thiol-activated toxins a conserved undecapeptide, ECTGLAWEWWR, located in the C-terminal region of the protein and containing the unique cysteine of the molecule. Single and double amino acid substitutions were created in the theta-toxin molecule to investigate the role of individual tryptophan residues in the lytic activity of theta-toxin. Wild-type and mutant theta-toxins were overproduced in Escherichia coli by means of a T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system and purified. The relative hemolytic activities of four mutant toxins, each with a Trp to Phe substitution outside the common Cys-containing region, were more than 60% that of wild-type theta-toxin. In contrast, mutant toxins with Phe replacements within the Cys-containing region (at Trp436, Trp438 or Trp439) showed significantly reduced hemolytic and erythrocyte-membrane-binding activities. The largest reduction in binding affinity, more than 100-fold, was observed for Trp438 mutant toxins. However, the mutants retain binding specificity for cholesterol and the ability to form arc-shaped and ring-shaped structures on membranes. These results indicate that the low hemolytic activities of these mutant toxins can be ascribed, at least in part, to reduced binding activities. With respect to protease susceptibility and far-ultraviolet circular-dichroism spectra, only the W436-->F mutant toxin, showed any considerable difference from wild-type toxin in secondary or higher-order structures, indicating that Trp436 is essential for maintenance of toxin structure.
TI  - Evidence that Arg-295, Glu-378, and Glu-380 are active-site residues of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of iota toxin.
AB  - The active site of the enzymatic component (Ia) of the Clostridium perfringens iota toxin has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Sequence alignment showed that Ia and C3 enzymes display a segment in their C-terminal part which is homologous to that forming the active domain of pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, and Escherichia coli thermolabile toxins. This structure consists of a beta-strand and an alpha-helix which forms the NAD-binding cavity and which is flanked by two catalytic spatially conserved residues involved in catalysis [Domenighini et al. (1994) Mol. Microbiol. 14, 41-50]. Substitutions (Arg-295-Lys, Glu-378-Ala, Glu-380-Asp, and Glu-380-Ala) induced a drastic decrease in ADP-ribosylation and cytotoxic activities, while substitution of the adjacent Arg (Arg-296-Lys) only partially affected the enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity. These results indicate that Arg-295, Glu-378 and Glu-380 of Ia are involved in the ADP-ribosylation activity which is essential for the morphological changes of cells treated with iota toxin.
TI  - Foal diarrhoea between 1991 and 1994 in the United Kingdom associated with Clostridium perfringens, rotavirus, Strongyloides westeri and Cryptosporidium spp.
AB  - A case control study of foal diarrhoea in the United Kingdom was carried out over a 3-year period. Clostridium perfringens was significantly associated with foal diarrhoea (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.0), being isolated from 57% of 421 animals with diarrhoea but from only 27% of 223 healthy foals. Also, C. perfringens was significantly associated with fatal diarrhoea (OR = 4.5). About half of diarrhoea with a fatal outcome was attributable to this organism. The other pathogens significantly associated with diarrhoea were rotavirus (OR = 5.6), Cryptosporidium spp. (OR = 3.2) and the nematode Strongyloides westeri, which was significant only when present in large numbers (> 2000 eggs/g of faeces: OR = 6.1). Salmonella spp. (OR = 14.2) and Cryptosporidium spp. (OR = 3.0) were the only other pathogens associated with fatal illness. Overall, C. perfringens, rotavirus, and large numbers of Cryptosporidium spp. or S. westeri were isolated from 80% of foals with diarrhoea. Thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli and other parasites were not associated with diarrhoea. Carriage of C. perfringens, rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. was significantly greater in healthy foals in contact with cases of diarrhoea than in foals that were not in contact with diarrhoea (P < 0.05). There were no statistical interactions between any of the pathogens associated with diarrhoea although separate cases from one location often involved more than one pathogen.
TI  - Molecular cloning of Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin gene and its high level expression in E. coli.
AB  - A gene coding for epsilon-toxin was isolated from a field isolate of Clostridium  perfringens type D by PCR amplification and was cloned under the control of T5 promoter fused with six-histidine tag at the amino terminal end. Escherichia coli cells harbouring this construct expressed high levels of the recombinant protein in the form of inclusion bodies. The protein was purified using single step affinity chromatography on a Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose column. Upon immunization of rabbit with the purified recombinant protein, high antibody titre was detected. The antibodies raised against the recombinant protein were able to recognize the recombinant as well as the native toxin. Anti epsilon-toxin monoclonal antibody was able to detect the recombinant protein in a Western blot. N-terminal sequence of the recombinant protein matched with the known sequence of the toxin. At the shake flask level, up to 20 mg of pure epsilon-prototoxin was produced per litre of culture.
TI  - Transmembrane glutamic acid residues play essential roles in the metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Three transmembrane aspartyl residues play essential roles in the transposon Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (Tet(B)) [Yamaguchi, A. et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7490-7498]. The tetK gene-encoding tetracycline resistance protein (Tet(K)) of Staphylococcus aureus mediates metal-tetracycline/H+ antiport similarly to Tet(B); however, it has no transmembrane aspartyl residue. On the other hand, Tet(K) has three glutamyl residues, Glu-30, Glu-152 and Glu-397, in the putative transmembrane regions. In the present work, tet(K) gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the transport activity was measured in everted membrane vesicles. When these glutamyl residues were replaced with Gln, the tetracycline transport activity was almost completely lost, indicating the important roles of these residues in Tet(K). In the case of Glu-397, even the charge-conserved mutation to Asp caused complete loss of the activity. On the other hand, the mutation of Glu-30 and Glu-152 to Asp resulted in significant retention of transport activity. These results are similar to those on the mutation of the three transmembrane aspartyl residues in Tet(B), indicating that the transmembrane glutamyl residues in Tet(K) play roles similar to those of the transmembrane aspartyl residues in Tet(B).
TI  - Role of enteric pathogens in the aetiology of neonatal diarrhoea in lambs and goat kids in Spain.
AB  - Faeces samples from diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic lambs and goat kids aged 1-45 days were examined for enteric pathogens. Cryptosporidium parvum was detected in both diarrhoeic lambs (45%) and goat kids (42%) but not in non-diarrhoeic animals. F5+ (K99+) and/or F41+ Escherichia coli strains were isolated from 26% and 22% of the diarrhoeic lambs and goat kids, respectively, although these strains, which did not produce enterotoxins ST I or LT I, were found with similar frequencies in non-diarrhoeic animals. A F5-F41-ST I+ E. coli strain was isolated from a diarrhoeic lamb (0.6%). Verotoxigenic E. coli was isolated from both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic lambs (4.1% and 8.2%, respectively) and there was no association between infection and diarrhoea. The prevalence of group A rotavirus infection in diarrhoeic lambs was very low (2.1%). Groups A and B rotaviruses were detected in three (8.1%) and five (13.5%) diarrhoeic goat kids from two single outbreaks. Group C rotaviruses were detected in four non-diarrhoeic goat kids. An association of diarrhoea and infection was demonstrated only for group B rotavirus. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from 10.8% of the diarrhoeic goat kids but not from non-diarrhoeic goat kids or lambs. Salmonella arizonae was isolated from a diarrhoeic goat kid (2.7%) and the clinical characteristics of the outbreaks where these two latter enteropathogens were found different from the rest. Picobirnaviruses were detected in a diarrhoeic lamb. No coronaviruses were detected using a bovine coronavirus ELISA. No evidence was found of synergistic effect between the agents studied. Enteric pathogens were not found in four (8.7%) and three (20%) outbreaks of diarrhoea in lambs and goat kids, respectively.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis in children.
AB  - Specimens obtained from eight children with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 21 isolates were recovered, 13 anaerobic and 8 aerobic or facultatives. The facultative organism Streptococcus pyogenes was present alone in two (25%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in six (75%). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (6 isolates, including 3 Peptostreptococcus magnus). S. pyogenes (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (3), Clostridium perfringens (2), Escherichia coli (2), and Prevotella spp. (2). Organisms similar to the ones isolated from the NF aspirates were recovered in the blood of all patients except one. These included S. pyogenes (3 isolates). B. fragilis group (2), E. coli (1), and P. magnus (1) and Clostridium perfringens (1). All patients underwent surgical fasciotomy, and four required skin grafting. Antimicrobials were administered to all children. Despite extensive resection and intense supportive therapy, three patients died from sepsis accompanied by shock acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of NF in children.
TI  - Detection by polymerase chain reaction of Clostridium perfringens producing epsilon toxin in faeces and in gastrointestinal contents of goats.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the gene-encoding epsilon  toxin production in Clostridium perfringens types B and D in faeces and in gastrointestinal contents of goats. The samples were cultured in thioglycollate broth and centrifuged. The upper layer of the pellet was used as a template for PCR, obviating the need for DNA extraction. This technique specifically differentiated Cl. perfringens types B and D from Cl. perfringens types A and C and from Escherichia coli. When used to identify Cl. perfringens type D in samples artificially spiked with the micro-organism, the PCR detected as few as 1.4 x 10(2) cfu g-1 of sample. Gastrointestinal contents and faeces were collected from 20 goats at slaughter and processed by PCR. Several positive results were obtained from the first five goats that were slaughtered and sampled a few days after their arrival at the abattoir, but only a few samples gave positive results during the following weeks, after the goats had been fed a concentrated ration containing monensin. A possible role of this drug in control of enterotoxaemia is suggested.
TI  - New gene from nine Bacillus sphaericus strains encoding highly conserved 35.8-kilodalton mosquitocidal toxins.
AB  - A new gene encoding a 35.8-kDa mosquitocidal toxin (Mtx3; 326 amino acids) was isolated from Bacillus sphaericus SSII-1 DNA. Mtx3 is a new type of mosquitocidal toxin with homology to the Mtx2 mosquitocidal toxin of B. sphaericus SSII-1, the epsilon-toxin of Clostridium perfringens, and the cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mtx3 gene is highly conserved and widely distributed in both high- and low-toxicity mosquito larvicidal strains of B. sphaericus.
TI  - Expression and purification of a recombinant "small" sialidase from Clostridium perfringens A99.
AB  - A 1.4-kb gene encoding the "small" sialidase isoenzyme of Clostridium perfringens A99, including its own promoter, was previously cloned in and expressed by Escherichia coli JM 101. Since all attempts to purify this enzyme to homogeneity were unsuccessful, a new strategy was developed. The structural gene was amplified by means of a PCR technique and inserted into the plasmid vector pQE-10, transferring a six-histidine affinity tag (His6) to the N-terminus of the protein. In order to minimize proteolytic degradation of the sialidase protein, the gene was subcloned into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys S with reduced protease activity. The sialidase production was increased about 2.5-fold when compared with that of the original clone. The enzyme, released by lysozyme treatment of the bacterial cells, was purified by metal chelate chromatography on Ni-nitrilo-triacetic acid agarose to apparent homogeneity in SDS-PAGE. The 42-kDa protein was enriched 62-fold with a yield of 82% and a specific activity of 280 U mg-1. A total amount of 1 mg sialidase was obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture. For future studies, including crystallization experiments, the histidine affinity tag was removed from the sialidase enzyme by aminopeptidase K. The sialidase was then separated from aminopeptidase K by ion-exchange chromatography, resulting in an overall yield of 83% and a specific activity of 305 U mg-1 using 4-methylumbelliferyl- alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid under standard conditions. The two forms (with or without the histidine tag) of sialidase exhibited similar kinetic properties when compared to the wild-type enzyme.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in equine synovial fluid by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus equuli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming U/mL. Synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated inoculum of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. Inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or Columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. Then aliquots were removed for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial DNA corresponding to a region of the 16S ribosomal gene. Duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. Bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. Under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and PCR analyses for detection of bacteria. Experimentally, PCR was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, marbofloxacin (RO 09-1168) against strictly anaerobic bacteria and some bacteria from human fecal flora].
AB  - As recommended by the EEC, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. Thus, the MICs for Marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (Norma NCCLS M11 A3) using Wilkins Chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and Mueller Hinton agar for E. coli, Proteus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus. On the whole aerobes, the activity of Marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. The modal MIC was 0.03 mg/l for Enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for Enterococcus and Lactobacillus strains, respectively. Considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug, in comparison with that of ofloxacin, MICs for ofloxacin were generally one log2 higher for Gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for Gram positive bacilli. Modal MICs for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for Clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for Bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the B. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for C. difficile strains, respectively. It appears in vitro that Marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.
TI  - Gram-negative bacteremia in four patients with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.
AB  
TI  - A Bacillus sphaericus gene encoding a novel type of mosquitocidal toxin of 31.8 kDa.
AB  - A size-fractionated genomic library of Bacillus sphaericus strain SSII-1 was constructed and screened for toxicity against larvae of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus (Cq). One toxin-producing clone, pS35, was identified and a 2.7-kb subclone was completely sequenced. An open reading frame of 879 bp encoding a 31.8-kDa protein (designated Mtx2) was identified. Purified, recombinant Mtx2 was toxic to Cq larvae. Mtx2 shows no significant homology to known insecticidal toxins, but has homology to two toxins active against mammalian cells, namely the epsilon-toxin of Clostridium perfringens and the cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, Mtx2 represents a new type of mosquitocidal toxin.
TI  - Influence of bile salts on beta-glucuronidase activity of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The beta-glucuronidase activity of intact cells of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens was increased in the presence of bile salts. In contrast, bile salts had inhibitory effects on the activity of beta-glucuronidase extracted from the lysed cells. These results suggest that the permeability of the bacterial cells is increased by the presence of bile salts, and that bile salts may significantly enhance bacterial beta-glucuronidase activity in the intestinal tract.
TI  - Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on latex and silicone T-tubes in relation to bacterial contamination of bile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: T-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. To prevent these, the choice of T-tube material may be of importance. METHODS: Transected common bile ducts (CBDs) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone T-tubes, or without a T-tube. RESULTS: After 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 CBDs with and in 1 of 5 CBDs without a T-tube (p < 0.05). By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) four of five latex and none of five silicone T-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). All tubes remained patent. Segments of T-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. Sonication and SEM showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to T-tubes. Two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. Less infectious complications occur if T-tubes are omitted.
TI  - The reactivity of sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to seven different species of single and double stranded deoxyribonucleic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-DNA antibodies are frequently found in the serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To understand whether the avidity of SLE sera to different species of single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA is different or not, the reactivity of active SLE sera to seven species of DNA from viral, bacterial, piscine, and mammalian sources was compared. METHODS: Nineteen sera from patients with active SLE were studied for their reactivity to different ssDNA and dsDNA from Escherichia coli (EC), Micrococcus lysodeikticus (ML), Clostridium perfringens (CP), calf thymus (CT), salmon testis (ST), human placenta (HP) and lambda phage by ELISA. The dsDNA was purified by treating it with S1 nuclease and proteinase K, followed by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration. The ssDNA was purified by absorption on a hydroxyapatite column after heat-cleavage of the dsDNA. RESULTS: The reactivity of SLE sera to 7 species of dsDNA was not significantly different and they recognized a more widely shared epitope. In contrast, the reactivity of these sera to 7 species of ssDNA was erratic and the antigens could be grouped into high (CP and HP), medium (EC, ML, CT, and ST) and low (lambda-phage) antigenicities. CONCLUSION: The anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies of SLE patients recognize more widely shared determinants on the DNA of seven different species. Lambda-phage DNA shows the poorest immunogenicity among them.
TI  - Acute emphysematous cholecystitis associated with pneumobilia: a case report.
AB  - This report describes a rare case of acute emphysematous cholecystitis with pneumobilia in the common bile duct. The patient was a 66-year-old woman with a part history of diabetes mellitus, and operations for gastric and breast carcinoma. The chief complaint was pain in the right hypochondrium with severe right hypochondrial tenderness and distention of the gallbladder detected on examination. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, marked elevation of CRP, jaundice, liver dysfunction, and hyperglycemia. Gas was detected in the gallbladder on plain abdominal X-rays and CT scans of the abdomen, and a small amount of gas was also observed in the common bile duct. On the day of admission, percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) was carried out under ultrasound guidance, and Clostridium perfingens and E. coli were detected in the bile. Imaging after PTGBD showed no cystic duct obstruction. On the 12th day after PTGBD, cholecystectomy and choledochotomy with primary closure were performed. The postoperative course was good and the patient was discharged on the 15th day after surgery.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and primary structure of Clostridium perfringens  lambda-toxin, a thermolysin-like metalloprotease.
AB  - The lambda-toxin of Clostridium perfringens type B NCIB10691 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by size exclusion, anion-exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The purified toxin had an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The toxin possessed casein-hydrolyzing activity, which was inhibited specifically by metal chelators, indicating that the toxin is a metalloprotease. The gene encoding the lambda-toxin (lam), which was shown by Southern analysis to be located on a 70-kb plasmid, was cloned into Escherichia coli cells. Nucleotide and N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that the lam gene encodes a 553-amino-acid protein, which is processed into a mature form, the molecular mass of which was calculated to be 35,722 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme contains an HEXXH motif characteristic of zinc metalloproteases and is homologous to other known enzymes belonging to the thermolysin family. The purified toxin degraded various biologically important substances, such as collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, immunoglobulin A, and the complement C3 component. It caused an increase in vascular permeability and hemorrhagic edema on injection into the dorsal skin of mice. These results suggest that the toxin contributes to the pathogenesis of histolytic infection by lambda-toxin-producing C. perfringens.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of phospholipase C genes from Clostridium perfringens types A to E and Clostridium novyi.
AB  - The phylogenetic interrelationships between strains of 5 toxin types (A to E) of  Clostridium perfringens were examined by analysis of differences in the nucleotide sequences of phospholipase C genes (plc genes) among 10 strains, including 3 strains for which the plc gene sequences have been previously reported. A plc gene was also cloned from a Clostridium novyi type A strain and sequenced to analyze the interspecies diversity of plc genes. Phylogenetic trees constructed by the neighbor-joining method revealed that the phylogeny of C. perfringens strains is not related to toxin typing, in agreement with the results of a comparative genome mapping study by Canard et al. (B. Canard, B. Saint-Joanis, and S. T. Cole, Mol. Microbiol. 6:1421-1429, 1992). Various C. perfringens phospholipase C enzymes were purified from cultures of Escherichia coli cells into which the encoding plc genes had been cloned. All of the enzymes showed the same specific activity. On the other hand, the level of plc transcripts differed greatly (up to 40-fold) from one C. perfringens strain to another. No significant difference in the nucleotide sequence of the plc promoter region was observed for any of the plc genes. These results suggest that the variation in phospholipase C activity among different strains is not due to mutation in the plc coding region but to that in an extragenic region. The evolution of C. perfringens phospholipase C is discussed on the basis of similarities and differences between clostridial plc genes.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium perfringens Iota-toxin genes and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a mechanosensitive channel MscL homologue in  Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The mscL gene, which encodes the protein forming a large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL) in Escherichia coli, has previously been cloned and sequenced by Sukharev et al. [Nature 368 (1994) 265-268]. We found a gene homologous to mscL in Clostridium perfringens which is located just downstream from the collagenase-encoding gene in the opposite direction.
TI  - Small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) gene from Clostridium perfringens can replace the gene for the Bacillus subtilis scRNA in both growth and sporulation.
AB  - Small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) is a member of an evolutionarily conserved signal-recognition-particle-like RNA family. Using a DNA fragment of Bacillus subtilis scRNA gene as a probe, we cloned and characterized a Clostridium perfringens gene encoding the scRNA. Mapping the 5' and 3' ends of scRNA revealed that C. perfringens scRNA consists of 269 nucleotides: the sequence has about 70% primary sequence homology with B. subtilis scRNA. The predicted secondary structure appeared to be similar to that of B. subtilis scRNA, indicating that there are domains I and II in C. perfringens scRNA, in addition to domain IV. Functional analysis showed that C. perfringens scRNA could compensate for vegetative growth and allow the formation of heat-resistant spores in an scRNA-depleted B. subtilis strain, whereas Escherichia coli 4.5S RNA could not maintain sporulation. Since both E. coli 4.5S RNA and C. perfringens scRNA have the same binding specificity to B. subtilis Ffh protein, the difference in complementation activity reflects the function of domains I and II.
TI  - DNA-based monitoring of total bacterial community structure in environmental samples.
AB  - Determining the structure of bacterial communities and their response to stimuli  is key to understanding community function and the interactions that occur between micro-organisms and the environment. However, bacterial communities often comprise complex assemblages of large numbers of different bacterial populations. An approach is presented which allows bacterial community structure to be determined by fractionation of the complex mixture of total bacterial community DNA using the DNA-binding dye bisbenzimidazole which imposes G+C-dependent changes in the buoyant density of DNA. Bacterial community structure presented as percentage of total DNA vs. percentage G+C content of DNA is an indication of the relative abundance of phylogenetic groups of bacteria. Changes in the composition of a soil bacterial community in response to perturbations in the form of carbon amendment and altered water status were monitored.
TI  - A gene (sleC) encoding a spore-cortex-lytic enzyme from Clostridium perfringens S40 spores; cloning, sequence analysis and molecular characterization.
AB  - Antiserum was raised against a 31 kDa spore-cortex-lytic enzyme, which is released during germination of Clostridium perfringens S40 spores. Western blotting of dormant spore and vegetative cell fractions separated by SDS-PAGE indicated that the 31 kDa enzyme is spore-specific and that the enzyme in the dormant spore exists as a 36 kDa protein which has no cortex-lytic activity. A gene encoding the 31 kDa enzyme, sleC, was cloned into Escherichia coli using a synthetic oligonucleotide as a hybridization probe and the nucleotide sequence of the entire gene was determined. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 36 kDa protein was found in this reading frame, confirming that the 36 kDa protein is a pro-form of the 31 kDa enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the 31 kDa enzyme is produced as a precursor, comprising three portions; an N-terminal prepro-sequence (114 amino acid residues), a pro-sequence (35 amino acid residues) and a mature enzyme (289 amino acid residues). It is suggested that the 36 kDa pro-enzyme is non-covalently attached to the exterior of the cortex layer, and that the proform is processed to release the active enzyme during germination.
TI  - Diversity in the properties of two sialidase isoenzymes produced by Clostridium perfringens spp.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens produces two sialidases, one of which has a molecular mass of 71 kDa and is secreted, while the 'small', 43 kDa isoenzyme remains in the cells. The secreted, higher molecular mass sialidases of two different clostridial strains, DSM756T and A99, exhibit maximum activity at pH 5.5 and at 51 or 55 degrees C, respectively. The molecular mass of both enzymes is 71 kDa in SDS-PAGE and 63 kDa as determined by gel-filtration, which indicates the absence of subunits. Natural sialidase substrates are hydrolyzed at comparably high rates, e.g. the glycoproteins fetuin and bovine submandibular gland mucin, the homopolymer colominic acid, and the ganglioside mixture from bovine brain. The partially purified 'small' isoenzyme from C. perfringens A99 cells had similar properties to the corresponding recombinant sialidase isolated from the Escherichia coli host. It is located inside the clostridial and E. coli cells and exhibits maximum activity at pH 6.1 and 37 degrees C. A relative molecular mass of 32,000 was found with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography, while primary structure analysis yielded a value of 43,000. It differs a significantly from the 'large' isoenzyme by substrate specificity. Preferred substrates are oligosaccharides, while other, more complex sialoglycoconjugates are hydrolyzed only at very low rates. alpha 2,3-linkages are hydrolyzed much faster than alpha 2,6-bonds.
TI  - An outbreak of diarrhoea associated with atypical rotaviruses in goat kids.
AB  - The presence of rotaviruses was investigated in the faeces of 31 goat kids in a dairy herd that experienced an outbreak of severe diarrhoea which caused dehydration, anorexia and prostration in seven (22.6 per cent) of them. All the affected animals were two to three days old. A group A-specific ELISA failed to detect rotaviruses in any of the samples but the characteristics electropherotype of group B rotaviruses was observed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in six of the animals. A highly significant statistical association between the shedding of rotavirus and the occurrence of diarrhoea was demonstrated. All the rotaviruses were detected in animals three to four days old. Cryptosporidium parvum, Clostridium perfringens and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were not detected in the seven diarrhoeic animals.
TI  - Efficient gene delivery and expression in mammalian cells using DNA coupled with  perfringolysin O.
AB  - Current non-viral DNA vectors for gene therapy are limited by low cellular transfection efficiencies and low levels of gene expression due to inefficient endosomal DNA release. We have used perfringolysin O (PFO), a membrane active bacterial protein, to deliver DNA into cells. PFO belongs to the so-called sulphydryl-activated family of membrane active bacterial proteins, which have been used to deliver small molecules and proteins into cells. PFO was incorporated into DNA complexes through a biotin-streptavidin bridge and the DNA-PFO complexes were used to deliver the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene into cells. High levels of gene expression were achieved in murine sol 8 myoblast cells using these DNA-PFO complexes. The level of gene expression correlated well with the content of PFO in the complexes. Under optimal conditions, 15-20% of the cells were stained blue with X-gal. Furthermore, the expression was independent of a receptor ligand. Thus, membrane active bacterial proteins may be an important tool for the future development of non-viral DNA delivery systems for gene therapy.
TI  - Expression and purification of Clostridium perfringens beta-toxin glutathione S-transferase fusion protein.
AB  - The beta-toxin gene from Clostridium perfringens type C was cloned and expressed  as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence was determined and compared to the type B sequence. Two nucleotide differences were found in the protein coding sequence, resulting in one amino acid difference between the two proteins. The purified beta-toxin fusion protein is not toxic in mice, but rabbit antiserum raised against it neutralises the toxic effect of C. perfringens type C culture filtrate in mice.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a conjugated bile acid hydrolase gene from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The gene encoding a conjugated bile acid hydrolase (CBAH) from Clostridium perfringens 13 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analyses indicated that the gene product is related to two previously characterized amidases, a CBAH from Lactobacillus plantarum (40% identity) and a penicillin V amidase from Bacillus sphaericus (34% identity). The product is apparently unrelated to a CBAH from C. perfringens for which N-terminal sequence information was determined. The gene product was purified from recombinant E. coli and used to raise antibody in rabbits. The presence of the protein in C. perfringens was then confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The protein was shown to have a native molecular weight of 147,000 and a subunit molecular weight of 36,100, indicating its probable existence as a tetramer. Disruption of the chromosomal C. perfringens CBAH gene with a chloramphenicol resistance cartridge resulted in a mutant strain which retained partial CBAH activity. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by enzymatic activity staining and immunoblotting indicated that the mutant strain no longer expressed the cloned CBAH (CBAH-1) but did express at least one additional CBAH (CBAH-2). CBAH-2 was immunologically distinct from CBAH-1, and its mobility on native polyacrylamide gels was different from that of CBAH-1. Furthermore, comparisons of pH optima and substrate specificities of CBAH activities from recombinant E. coli and wild-type and mutant C. perfringens provided further evidence for the presence of multiple CBAH activities in C. perfringens.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a Bacteroides gene, csuF, which encodes an outer membrane protein that is essential for growth on chondroitin sulfate.
AB  - Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron can utilize a variety of polysaccharides, including  charged mucopolysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Since the enzymes (chondroitin lyases I and II) that catalyze the first step in breakdown of CS and HA are located in the periplasm, we had proposed that the first step in utilization of these polysaccharides was binding to one or more outer membrane proteins followed by translocation into the periplasm, but no such outer membrane proteins had been shown to play a role in CS or HA utilization. Previously we have isolated a transposon-generated mutant, CS4, which was unable to grow on CS or HA but retained the ability to grow on disaccharide components of CS. This phenotype suggested that the mutation in CS4 either blocked the transport of the mucopolysaccharides into the periplasmic space or blocked the depolymerization of the mucopolysaccharides into disaccharides. We have mapped the CS4 mutation to a single gene, csuF, which is capable of encoding a protein of 1,065 amino acids and contains a consensus signal sequence. Although CsuF had a predicted molecular weight and pI similar to those of chondroitin lyases, it did not show significant sequence similarity to the Bacteroides chondroitin lyase II, a Proteus chondroitin ABC lyase, or two hyaluronidases from Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes, nor was any CS-degrading enzyme activity associated with csuF expression in Bacteroides species or Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of CsuF exhibited features suggestive of an outer membrane protein. We obtained antibodies to CsuF and demonstrated that the protein is located in the outer membrane. This is the first evidence that a nonenzymatic outer membrane protein is essential for utilization of CS and HA.
TI  - Is cardiorespiratory failure induced by bacterial toxins the cause of sudden infant death syndrome? Studies with an animal model (the rabbit).
AB  - Recent studies have implicated various toxigenic bacteria and their toxins in the aetiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Therefore the effect of six bacterial toxins on the cardiorespiratory system of the rabbit was studied as a model for SIDS. The toxins' effect on the heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and breathing of anaesthetized rabbits was determined and their action compared to that of endotoxin. Intravenous injection of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin and alpha-toxin, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, Escherichia coli heat-stable toxin (STa), Clostridium difficile toxin A and B reduced heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and increased, slowed and prolonged thorax expansion, and at higher concentrations caused sudden death without visible stress or trauma. A combination of a low concentration of enterotoxins caused a greater reduction of these activities and sudden death. These effects were generally similar to those produced by endotoxin. In non-anaesthetized rabbits, the toxins slowed metabolism until death occurred without agitation, spasms, visible distress or prolonged illness. Intestinal production of these toxins by toxigenic strains, when conditions are suitable, and their systemic absorption, could therefore cause SIDS by an endotoxin-like shock mechanism.
TI  - Survival of fecal microorganisms in marine and freshwater sediments.
AB  - The survival of culturable fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and Clostridium perfringens spores in freshwater and marine sediments from sites near sewage outfalls was studied. In laboratory studies, the inhibition of protozoan predators with cycloheximide allowed the fecal coliforms to grow in the sediment whereas the presence of predators resulted in a net die-off. C. perfringens spores did not appear either to be affected by predators or to die off throughout the duration of the experiments (28 days). Studies using in situ membrane diffusion chambers showed that, with the exception of C. perfringens, die-off of the test organisms to 10% of their initial numbers occurred in both marine and freshwater sediments within 85 days. The usual exponential decay model could not be applied to the sediment survival data, with the exception of the data for fecal streptococci. It was concluded that application of the usual decay model to the fecal coliform data was confounded by the complex relationship between growth and predation. The survival of seeded Escherichia coli in marine sediment was studied by using an enumeration method which detected viable but nonculturable bacteria. Throughout the duration of the experiment (68 days), the same proportion of E. coli organisms remained culturable, suggesting that sediment provides a favorable, nonstarvation environment for the bacteria.
TI  - The role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  - This study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive surgical infections. A dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. Therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. It was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. Therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. The times above the MIC in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: Escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; Haemophilus spp., 12 h; Proteus mirabilis, 12 h; Klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; Providencia spp., 9.2 h; Clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; Peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all S. aureus, 6.8 h. From the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the Gram-negative anaerobes. For those infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.
TI  - Molecular genetics of the chloramphenicol-resistance transposon Tn4451 from Clostridium perfringens: the TnpX site-specific recombinase excises a circular transposon molecule.
AB  - The chloramphenicol-resistance transposon Tn4451 undergoes precise conjugative deletion from its parent plasmid plP401 in Clostridium perfringens and precise spontaneous excision from multicopy plasmids in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 6338 bp transposon was determined and it was found to encode six genes. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the largest Tn4451-encoded gene, tnpX, was required for the spontaneous excision of the transposon in both E. coli and C. perfringens, since a Tn4451 derivative that lacked a functional tnpX gene was completely stable in both organisms. Because the ability of this derivative to excise was restored by providing the tnpX gene on a compatible plasmid, it was concluded that this gene encoded a trans-acting site-specific recombinase. Allelic exchange was used to introduce the tnpX delta 1 allele onto plP401 and it was shown that TnpX was also required for the conjugative excision of Tn4451 in C. perfringens. It was also shown by hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies that TnpX-mediated transposon excision resulted in the formation of a circular form of the transposon. The TnpX recombinase was unique because it potentially contained the motifs of two independent site-specific recombinase families, namely the resolvase/invertase and integrase families. Sequence analysis indicated that the resolvase/invertase domain of TnpX was likely to be involved in the excision process by catalysing the formation of a 2 bp staggered nick on either side of the GA dinucleotide located at the ends of the transposon and at the junction of the circular form. The other Tn4451-encoded genes include tnpZ, which appears to encode a second potential site-specific recombinase. This protein has similarity to plasmid-encoded Mob/Pre proteins, which are involved in plasmid mobilization and multimer formation. Located upstream of the tnpZ gene was a region with similarity to the site of interaction of these mobilization proteins.
TI  - Bioavailability and bacterial degradation of rectally administered 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine.
AB  - 2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA) is a new drug for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other lymphoproliferative diseases. It is generally administered as a continuous intravenous infusion during 5-7 days. The oral bioavailability is only 50%. The bioavailability after rectal administration was investigated in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Five milligrams per square metre was given i.v. as a 2-h infusion and 24 h later the same dose was administered rectally in a gel formulation. The mean bioavailability was only 21% due to deglycosylation of CdA to 2-chloroadenine (CAde). To further elucidate the factors which are important for the rectal availability of CdA, the in vitro stability of CdA in bacterial cultures was tested. Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli as well as whole feces rapidly deglycosylated CdA to CAde while Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis as well as saliva only degraded CdA slowly or not at all. It is concluded that, due to bacterial degradation, rectal administration of CdA has no advantage over oral administration.

TI  - Clostridial infection in children.
AB  - A survey of the isolation of Clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. The isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified Clostridium spp., 37 (33%) C. perfringens, 13 (12%) C. ramosum, five (4%) C. innocuum, six (5%) C. botulinum, three (3%) C. difficile, two (2%) C. butyricum, and one isolate each of C. bifermentans, C. clostridiiforme, C. limosum and C. paraputrificum. Most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). Predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. These were immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). The clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. The species most commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (50), Escherichia coli (22), pigmented Prevotella or Porphyromonas spp. (18) and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Most Bacteroides and Escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck sites. Antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). Only two patients died. These data illustrate the importance of Clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.
TI  - E-4695, a new C-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - E-4695, (-)-7-[3-(R)-amino-2-(S)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. The MICs of E-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive cocci, including species of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and the MIC90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Providencia spp. [MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. E-4695 inhibited 90% of the Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against gram-positive cocci the potency of E-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. Against enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa the potency of E-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. E-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against C. perfringens and B. fragilis isolates, respectively. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of pH or magnesium concentration were tested on them. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when pH decreased below 4.8. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mM Mg2+. The presence of serum and human urine at pH 7.2 decreased the activity of E-4695 between two- and fourfold. After an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for E-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. Fifty-percent effective doses (ED50S) against Staphylococcus aureus HS-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with E-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with E-4695 (ED50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ED50, 200 mg/kg). The ED50 of E-4695 for infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. E-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli HM-42 (ED50S, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). The ED50S of E-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa HS-116 and 9.6 and 18.9 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa B-120, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of E-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Sequence analysis of flanking regions of the pfoA gene of Clostridium perfringens: beta-galactosidase gene (pbg) is located in the 3'-flanking region.
AB  - The 3'-flanking region of the perfringolysin O (theta-toxin) gene (pfoA) of Clostridium perfringens was analyzed by chromosome walking. A total of 5,363 bp of the downstream region of the pfoA gene was sequenced and four open reading frames were found. ORF54 and ORF80 were found to be homologous to genes coding for membrane-bound transporter proteins of other bacteria and the beta-galactosidase gene (bgaB) of Bacillus stearothermophilus, respectively. ORF80 was named the pbg gene. Clones which showed beta-galactosidase activities were selected from a lambda FIXII genomic library of C. perfringens by blue plaque screening using X-Gal as a substrate. Four clones whose plaques showed blue appearances were obtained. Two of the four clones hybridized with the pbg probe but the others did not, indicating that there are two distinct beta-galactosidase genes in C. perfringens. The pbg gene was subcloned into pBR322 and was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, suggesting that the pbg gene codes for a beta-galactosidase of C. perfringens.
TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a 36-kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome between  the gnt and iol operons.
AB  - Within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire Bacillus subtilis genome, a 36-kb chromosome segment, which covers the region between the gnt and iol operons, has been cloned and sequenced. This region (36447 bp) contains 33 complete open reading frames (ORFs; genes) including the four gnt genes and one partial gene. A homology search for the products of the 33 complete ORFs revealed significant homology to known proteins in 16 of them such as tetracycline resistance protein (Clostridium perfringens), asparagine synthetase (Arabidopsis thaliana), aldehyde dehydrogenase (Pseudomonas oleovorans), 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1, 4-diol dehydrogenase (P. paucimobilis), heat shock protein HtpG (Escherichia coli), galactose-proton symporter (E. coli), auxin-induced protein (common tobacco), glucitol operon repressor (E. coli) and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (P. aeruginosa). Unlike the regions we sequenced so far, this region contained two short sequence multiplications: one was a tandem sequence duplication (409 and 410 bp), and the other a triplication consisting of two highly conserved 118-bp tandem sequences preceded by a less conserved similar sequence (129 bp). The reasons for the presence of these sequence multiplications in the gnt to iol region were deduced.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens, cloned in Escherichia coli, has been purified and crystallized from ammonium sulphate using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method at 20 degrees C. The crystals diffract to a minimum Bragg spacing of 2.7 A, belong to the space group R32 (with a = b = 153.3 A, c = 95.4 A, alpha = beta = 90 degrees and gamma = 120 degrees) and contain a single polypeptide chain in the crystallographic unit.
TI  - Expression from the Clostridium perfringens cpe promoter in C. perfringens and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a source of food poisoning in humans and animals because of production of a potent enterotoxin (CPE). To study the regulation of the cpe gene in C. perfringens, we cloned and sequenced the cpe promoter regions and N-terminal domains from three strains. The cpe promoter region from one strain contained a 45-bp insertion compared with previously published sequences. This insertion was also found in two (of five) other Cpe+ strains. cpe gene expression in C. perfringens was measured by using translational fusions of each promoter type to the Escherichia coli gusA gene, which codes for beta-glucuronidase. For either promoter type, cpe-gusA expression was undetectable throughout exponential growth but increased dramatically at the beginning of the stationary phase. To measure cpe expression in Bacillus subtilis, cpe-gusA fusions were integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome. Both types of promoter exhibited moderate expression during exponential growth; cpe expression increased threefold at the beginning of the stationary phase. Transcriptional start sites were determined by primer extension and in vitro transcription assays. For C. perfringens, both types of promoter gave the same 5' end, 197 bp upstream of the translation start (50 bp downstream of the 45-bp insertion). In B. subtilis, however, the 5' end was internal to the 45-bp insertion, suggesting the use of a different promoter than that utilized by C. perfringens.
TI  - The elevation of plasma DNA in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is attributable to increased DNA release and defective DNA binding of mononuclear cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although immunoprecipitable DNA has been found in a subgroup of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibiting systemic vasculitis and/or central nervous system involvement, the mechanism for elevated plasma DNA in these patients is poorly understood. METHODS: The plasma DNA concentrations and reactivity of serum and lymphocytes to six species of double-stranded DNA from calf thymus, human placenta, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Clostridium perfringens and poly (dG.dC). poly (dG.dC) were measured in twenty-seven patients with active SLE. To understand the mechanism of increased plasma DNA in SLE, the DNA binding and release of the mononuclear cells were examined. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the incidence of the presence of plasma DNA was markedly increased in SLE (59.3% in SLE vs. 7.4% in controls) as detected by counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Except for DNA from Clostridium perfringens, the reactivity of lupus sera to various DNA samples was significantly higher than that of the controls. The reactivity of lymphocytes to 6 species of DNA (as defined by 3H-thymidine incorporation of the cells) was also higher in SLE patients. In DNA binding and releasing experiments, patients with SLE were found to have decreased 3H-DNA binding activity (0.169 +/- 0.018 micrograms/2 x 10(6) cells in SLE vs. 0.283 +/- 0.02 micrograms/2 x 10(6) cells in controls, p = 0.001) but to have increased spontaneous release of DNA (1,465 +/- 412 cpm in SLE vs. 630 +/- 179 cpm in controls, p = 0.0173) in mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that some subsets of lymphocytes can be sensitized by different DNA samples in vivo to increase endogenous DNA release from mononuclear cells, which in addition to decreased DNA clearance as has been previously reported, may be responsible for the elevation of plasma DNA in patients with SLE.
TI  - Regulatory effects of bifidobacteria on the growth of other colonic bacteria.
AB  - In the human large intestine bifidobacteria are a numerically important group of  micro-organisms which are considered to exert a range of biological activities related to host health. One aspect is the inhibitory effect of these bacteria on other species, possibly excluding long term colonization by invasive pathogens. It has been suggested that the mechanism of inhibition carried out by bifidobacteria is related to the fermentative production of acids such as acetate and lactate. Experiments reported in this paper attempted to address this theory. Co-culture experiments whereby Bifidobacterium infantis was incubated with Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, in a variety of fermentation systems, indicated that the bifidobacterium was able to exert an inhibitory effect not necessarily related to acid production. Further studies showed that eight species of bifidobacteria could variously excrete an anti-microbial substance with a broad spectrum of activity. Species belonging to the genera Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter and Shigella, as well as Vibrio cholerae, were all affected. These results show that bifidobacteria are able to exert more than one mechanism of inhibition, which may be of some importance with regard to protection against gastroenteritis.

TI  - Effect of gamma irradiation on shelf life and bacterial and viral loads in hard-shelled clams (Mercenaria mercenaria).
AB  - The feasibility of using 60Co gamma irradiation to inactivate total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and F-coliphage in hard-shelled clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, was investigated. The results of three trials indicated average D10 values of 1.32 kGy for total coliforms, 1.39 kGy for fecal coliforms, 1.54 kGy for E. coli, 2.71 kGy for C. perfringens, and 13.50 kGy for F-coliphage. Irradiation doses of > 0.5 kGy were significantly lethal to the shellfish.
TI  - Regioselective transglycosylation in the synthesis of oligosaccharides: comparison of beta-galactosidases and sialidases of various origins.
AB  - N-Acetyl-lactosamine(beta-D-Gal p-(1-->4)-D-Glc pNAc) was synthesized regioselectively with the aid of the transglycosylation activity of beta-galactosidase isolated from Diplococcus pneumoniae using p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside as the donor. Also, transglycosylation of the sialyl group in an alpha-(2-->8)-linked sialic acid dimer or p-nitrophenyl glycoside of sialic acid to N-acetyl-lactosamine was performed using sialidases of various origins. When sialidase from Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter ureafaciens, or Vibrio cholerae was used, alpha-(2-->6)-linked sialyl N-acetyl-lactosamine was obtained regioselectively. In contrast, when sialidase from newcastle disease virus was used, the alpha-(2-->3)-linked isomer was obtained regioselectively. The regioselectivity of the transglycosylation reaction using beta-galactosidase and sialidase was compared with hydrolysis specificity toward the same linkages.
TI  - Two-year study of endemic enteric pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in New Caledonia.
AB  - A longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in New Caledonia from January 1990 to December 1991. Stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. Potential sources of contamination (drinking water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. One or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., HEp-2 cell adherent Escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (EPEC adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent E. coli (non-EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. Other major enteropathogens were Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. No Vibrio spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Shiga-like-toxin-producing E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, or enteroinvasive E. coli were identified. Shiga-like toxin I-producing E. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin II-producing enterotoxigenic E. coli were found in pigs.
TI  - Use of indicators for monitoring the reduction of pathogens in animal waste treated in biogas plants.
AB  - The possibility of including bacterial indicators in programmes for monitoring the disinfection of animal waste treated in biogas plants was examined. Five full-scale plants receiving waste from several farms were monitored. Of these, two used thermophilic and one mesophilic digestion exclusively whereas two employed a two stage process involving thermophilic pretreatment followed by mesophilic digestion. For each plant the reducing effect on bacterial pathogens present in the incoming waste and on E. coli and enterococci indigenous to the waste was followed over long periods of time (six to 16 months). It was found that both E. coli and enterococci could be used as indicators to monitor the reduction of vegetative bacterial pathogens, but the use of enterococci would give the broadest "safety margin" in this respect. It is concluded that thermophilic as well as mesophilic digestion with thermophilic pretreatment will result in a sufficient reduction of both vegetative pathogenic bacteria and intestinal parasites occurring in concentrations usually found in animal waste to allow for unrestricted use of the de-gassed material in agriculture. This cannot be said for mesophilic digestion used alone. To achieve a sufficient reduction in the number of pathogens during the digestion process, a decrease in the enterococcal concentration of at least 3-4 log10 units should be accomplished, which for normal waste would correspond to a maximum concentration of these bacteria in treated material in the order of 10(2) cfu/ml. It is suggested that enterococcal counts in newly digested material should be one of the parameters in a monitoring programme aimed at controlling the hygienic state of the end-product from large biogas plants.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of ermQ, the predominant macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance gene in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The erythromycin resistance determinant from Clostridium perfringens JIR100 has been cloned, sequenced, and shown to be expressed in Escherichia coli. An open reading frame with sequence similarity to erm genes from other bacteria was identified and designated the ermQ gene. On the basis of comparative sequence analysis, it was concluded that the ermQ gene represented a new Erm hybridization class, designated ErmQ. Genes belonging to the ErmQ class were found to be widespread in C. perfringens, since 30 of 38 macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistant C. perfringens strains, from diverse sources, hybridized to an ermQ-specific gene probe. The ermQ gene therefore represents the most common erythromycin resistance determinant in C. perfringens.
TI  - A Clostridium perfringens vector for the selection of promoters.
AB  - A promoter selection vector for Clostridium perfringens genes was constructed from a C. perfringens-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pJIR418. The plasmid carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (catP), derived from pIP401, downstream of the multiple cloning sites of pUC18. When a promoter region of the phospholipase C gene was inserted into one of the cloning sites, derivatives of C. perfringens strain 13 carrying the resultant plasmid acquired resistance to chloramphenicol. This plasmid should be useful reporter system for C. perfringens genes.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of the nagH gene encoding a hyaluronidase of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A recombinant lambda phage was identified in a Clostridium perfringens genomic library by means of its ability to hydrolyse the fluorescent substrate 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D-glucosaminide, isolated and shown to encode an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase. This enzyme, NagH, is also known as hyaluronidase, or Mu toxin, a putative virulence factor which is likely to act on connective tissue during gas gangrene. Nucleotide sequence analysis allowed the primary structure to be deduced and showed hyaluronidase to be a large exported protein of 114,392 Daltons and an enzyme of this size, endowed with the corresponding activities, was partially purified from C. perfringens. Hyaluronidase seems to be organised into two domains, an N-terminal region comprising 700 amino acids bearing the active site and a 300-residue C-terminal segment, containing three copies of an extended motif. Two other reading frames, linked to nagH, also appear to encode proteins with sugar-binding motifs.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of uncooked pork sausages in relation to public health.
AB  - One hundred and eighteen samples of uncooked pork sausages were analysed bacteriologically. The total aerobic plate count ranged from 1.8 x 10(8) to 9.2 x 10(8) CFU/g in the samples. High mean counts of Staphylococci, Enterococci, Micrococci, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella and Coliforms were observed. Staphylococcus aureus were encountered with count range 2.8 x 10(6) CFU/g to 7.4 x 10(6) CFU/g. The viable count of Escherichia coli ranged from 2.0 x 10(5) to 4.3 x 10(5) CFU/g. Clostridium perfringens were detected in 66.9% of samples with a count ranging from 3.9 x 10(2) to 1.1 x 10(7) Cl. perfringens/g. None of 118 samples contained Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): are common bacterial toxins responsible, and do they have a vaccine potential?
AB  - Despite extensive research, no unifying concept has satisfactorily explained the  cause of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The details are briefly outlined of some of the evidence supporting the hypothesis that common bacterial toxins are important in the aetiology of SIDS. These bacterial toxins act as triggers to initiate a biochemical cascade resulting in death. Data from four research groups, each working independently, indicated that the bacteria Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were present in higher numbers in infants who had suffered SIDS than in control infants. Certainly more detailed studies need to be performed on the role of bacterial infections in infants. There are many implications arising from this work, particularly the use of vaccination as a means of reducing infections, and consequently the number of SIDS deaths.
TI  - The virR gene, a member of a class of two-component response regulators, regulates the production of perfringolysin O, collagenase, and hemagglutinin in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The perfringolysin O (theta-toxin) gene (pfoA) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into an Escherichia coli-C. perfringens shuttle vector, and the pfoA gene was expressed in mutants of C. perfringens 13 which lacked the production of perfringolysin O. One group (SI117) could express the pfoA gene, and the other (SI112) could not. A mutation in the regulatory system for pfoA gene expression was suspected in SI112. A chromosomal DNA library constructed from strain 13 was transformed into strain SI112 to identify the regulatory gene(s) for the pfoA gene. Five strains of 10,000 transformants restored perfringolysin O production. All contained a 2.5-kb DNA fragment. This fragment activated the transcription of the pfoA gene and also restored the production of collagenase (kappa-toxin) and hemagglutinin in strain SI112. Deletion analysis showed that a 1.25-kb region was sufficient for the trans activity, and sequence analysis disclosed that open reading frame 2 (ORF2) was located in this region. A homology search for the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that ORF2 was homologous to a response regulator in a two-component signal transduction system. ORF2 was designated virR, and it is suggested that the virR gene plays an important role in the pathogenicity of C. perfringens.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Clostridium difficile by intestinal flora of infant faeces in continuous flow culture.
AB  - Growth of Clostridium difficile was inhibited more strongly in continuous flow (CF) culture with C. difficile-negative faeces of infants than with C. difficile-positive faeces. Culture of faecal flora of infants yielded a greater variety of bacterial species in C. difficile-negative than in C. difficile-positive faeces. In the mixed CF culture of C. difficile with Enterococcus avium, Bacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium lentum, C. ramosum, C. perfringens and either Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from C. difficile-negative faeces, inhibition of growth of C. difficile was demonstrated when the pH of the culture medium was decreased. Amino-acid analysis of CF cultures showed considerable utilisation of aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine. A marked increase in concentrations of citrulline and ornithine was found in the culture that inhibited growth of C. difficile. The addition of citrulline and ornithine into a Gifu anaerobic medium (GAM) broth produced no inhibition of growth of C. difficile. The addition of the mixture of the depleted amino acids (aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine) to the culture filtrate or adjustment of the pH of the culture filtrate induced considerable growth of C. difficile. These results suggest that the inhibition of growth of C. difficile may be due to consumption of amino acids by intestinal flora, and not to the presence of inhibitors produced by the intestinal flora.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Clostridium perfringens 120-kilodalton collagenase and nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens type C NCIB 10662 produced various gelatinolytic enzymes  with molecular masses ranging from approximately 120 to approximately 80 kDa. A 120-kDa gelatinolytic enzyme was present in the largest quantity in the culture supernatant, and this enzyme was purified to homogeneity on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme was identified as the major collagenase of the organism, and it cleaved typical collagenase substrates such as azocoll, a synthetic substrate (4-phenylazobenzyloxy-carbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Arg [Pz peptide]), and a type I collagen fibril. In addition, a gene (colA) encoding a 120-kDa collagenase was cloned in Escherichia coli. Nested deletions were used to define the coding region of colA, and this region was sequenced; from the nucleotide sequence, this gene encodes a protein of 1,104 amino acids (M(r), 125,966). Furthermore, from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme which was found in this reading frame, the molecular mass of the mature enzyme was calculated to be 116,339 Da. Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product showed that the enzyme was produced with a stretch of 86 amino acids containing a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch was found PLGP, the amino acid sequence constituting the Pz peptide. This sequence may be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase. A consensus zinc-binding sequence (HEXXH) suggested for vertebrate Zn collagenases is present in this bacterial collagenase. Vibrio alginolyticus collagenase and Achromobacter lyticus protease I showed significant homology with the 120-kDa collagenase of C. perfringens, suggesting that these three enzymes are evolutionarily related.
TI  - The Clostridium perfringens Tet P determinant comprises two overlapping genes: tetA(P), which mediates active tetracycline efflux, and tetB(P), which is related to the ribosomal protection family of tetracycline-resistance determinants.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence and mechanism of action of the tetracycline-resistance determinant, Tet P, from Clostridium perfringens has been determined. Analysis of the 4.4 kb of sequence data revealed the presence of two open reading frames, designated as tetA(P) and tetB(P). The tetA(P) gene appears to encode a 420 amino acid protein (molecular weight 46,079) with twelve transmembrane domains. This gene was shown to be responsible for the active efflux of tetracycline from resistant cells. Although there was some amino acid sequence similarity between the putative TetA(P) protein and other tetracycline efflux proteins, analysis suggested that TetA(P) represented a different type of efflux protein. The tetB(P) gene would encode a putative 652 amino acid protein (molecular weight 72,639) with significant sequence similarity to Tet(M)-like cytoplasmic proteins that specify a ribosomal-protection tetracycline-resistance mechanism. In both C. perfringens and Escherichia coli, tetB(P) encoded low-level resistance to tetracycline and minocycline whereas tetA(P) only conferred tetracycline resistance. The tetA(P) and tetB(P) genes appeared to be linked in an operon, which represented a novel genetic arrangement for tetracycline-resistance determinants. It is proposed that tetB(P) evolved from the conjugative transfer into C. perfringens of a tet(M)-like gene from another bacterium.
TI  - IS231 and other Bacillus thuringiensis transposable elements: a review.
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis is an entomopathogenic bacterium whose toxicity is due to  the presence in the sporangia of delta-endotoxin crystals active against agricultural pests and vectors of human and animal diseases. Most of the genes coding for these toxin proteins are plasmid-borne and are generally structurally associated with insertion sequences (IS231, IS232, IS240, ISBT1 and ISBT2) and transposons (Tn4430 and Tn5401). Several of these mobile elements have been shown to be active and are believed to participate in the crystal gene mobility, thereby contributing to the variation of bacterial toxicity. Structural analysis of the iso-IS231 elements indicates that they are related to IS1151 from Clostridium perfringens and distantly related to IS4 and IS186 from Escherichia coli. Like the other IS4 family members, they contain a conserved transposase-integrase motif found in other IS families and retroviruses. Moreover, functional data gathered from IS231A in Escherichia coli indicate a non-replicative mode of transposition, with a marked preference for specific targets. Similar results were also obtained in Bacillus subtilis and B. thuringiensis, and a working model for DNA-protein interactions at the target site is proposed.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin genes and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The iota toxin which is produced by Clostridium perfringens type E, is a binary toxin consisting of two independent polypeptides: Ia, which is an ADP-ribosyltransferase, and Ib, which is involved in the binding and internalization of the toxin into the cell. Two degenerate oligonucleotide probes deduced from partial amino acid sequence of each component of C. spiroforme toxin, which is closely related to the iota toxin, were used to clone three overlapping DNA fragments containing the iota-toxin genes from C. perfringens type E plasmid DNA. Two genes, in the same orientation, coding for Ia (387 amino acids) and Ib (875 amino acids) and separated by 243 noncoding nucleotides were identified. A predicted signal peptide was found for each component, and the secreted Ib displays two domains, the propeptide (172 amino acids) and the mature protein (664 amino acids). The Ia gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli and C. perfringens, under the control of its own promoter. The recombinant polypeptide obtained was recognized by Ia antibodies and ADP-ribosylated actin. The expression of the Ib gene was obtained in E. coli harboring a recombinant plasmid encompassing the putative promoter upstream of the Ia gene and the Ia and Ib genes. Two residues which have been found to be involved in the NAD+ binding site of diphtheria and pseudomonas toxins are conserved in the predicted Ia sequence (Glu-14 and Trp-19). The predicted amino acid Ib sequence shows 33.9% identity with and 54.4% similarity to the protective antigen of the anthrax toxin complex. In particular, the central region of Ib, which contains a predicted transmembrane segment (Leu-292 to Ser-308), presents 45% identity with the corresponding protective antigen sequence which is involved in the translocation of the toxin across the cell membrane.
TI  - Effects of the in vitro fermentation of oligofructose and inulin by bacteria growing in the human large intestine.
AB  - The in vitro fermentability of oligofructose and inulin was compared with a range of reference carbohydrates by measuring bacterial end-product formation in batch culture. Short chain fatty acid and gas formation indicated that these substrates, which occur naturally in the diet and reach the colon in a largely intact form, were utilized by mixed populations of gut bacteria. Bacterial growth data showed that oligofructose and inulin exerted a preferential stimulatory effect on numbers of the health-promoting genus Bifidobacterium, whilst maintaining populations of potential pathogens (Escherichia coli, Clostridium) at relatively low levels. Pure culture studies confirmed the enhanced ability of bifidobacteria to utilize these substrates in comparison with glucose. Batch culture experiments demonstrated that the growth of Bifidobacterium infantis had an inhibitory effect towards E. coli and Clostridium perfringens. Potentially, an increase in the concentration of these substrates in the diet may therefore improve the composition of the large intestinal microflora and have positive effects on the quality of the Western diet.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of beta-toxin of Clostridium perfringens reveals sequence homology with alpha-toxin, gamma-toxin, and leukocidin of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Oligonucleotide probes designed on the basis of the N-terminal sequence of Clostridium perfringens beta-toxin were used to isolate the encoding gene (cpb). The nucleotide sequence of cpb was determined, and on the basis of DNA hybridization experiments it was shown that the gene is found only in type B and C strains of C. perfringens. The deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-toxin revealed homology with the alpha-toxin, gamma-toxin, and leukocidin of Staphylococcus aureus. The beta-toxin purified from C. perfringens appeared to exist in monomeric and multimeric forms. Recombinant beta-toxin, produced in Escherichia coli, appeared to be mainly in the multimeric form.
TI  - Spontaneous rupture of the liver.
AB  - A case of spontaneous hepatic rupture associated with bacterial cholangiohepatitis, an entity not previously described as an etiologic factor, is reported and the literature reviewed. Awareness of the pathophysiology of this process and avoidance of certain procedures are important parts of the surgical armamentarium.
TI  - Investigations on the aerobic flora and Clostridium perfringens in fecal specimens from free-living and captive capercaillies (Tetrao urogallus L., 1758).
AB  - 173 fecal specimens from captive Capercaillies and 92 fecal specimens from free-living Capercaillies were examined bacteriologically. With all specimens the bacteriological examination was limited to the aerobic bacteria which can be isolated by the usual methods and to Clostridium perfringens. The occurrence of fungi and parasites was examined as well. The present paper compares the results of these examinations. The identifiable fecal flora of free-living Capercaillies consists of few species with low colony numbers. In about half of the specimens Bacillus spp. are the main aerobic component while only a small number of the fecal specimens contain Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. None of the literature to date has stated that Streptococcus spp. do not belong to the autochthonous fecal or intestinal flora of an avian species. Clostridium perfringens cannot be isolated. The identifiable fecal flora of captive Capercaillies consists of many species with high colony numbers. Almost all fecal specimens contain Escherichia coli and various Bacillus spp. Streptococcus spp. can be isolated frequently, other enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens are present. The results of the examinations for fungi and parasites only differ slightly from those in wild birds.
TI  - Pore-forming and haemolytic properties of the Gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin.
AB  - The pleomorphic bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis releases in the culture broth a haemolytic exotoxin (Gvh) which is probably a virulence determinant of this unique bacterium, implicated in gynaecological and urological disorders. This 59 kDa cytolysin was purified to homogeneity in just one chromatographic step directly from the culture supernatant, a final specific activity up to 1.9 x 10(6) HU mg-1 being obtained. The toxin-induced lesion on human erythrocytes results from the formation of a pore whose radius is approximately 2.4 nm. The damage is inhibited by osmotic protectants and shows a sigmoidal dose-response profile suggesting an aggregation process of haemolysin molecules on the target membrane to create the functional lesion. The extent and the kinetics of haemolysis are strongly dependent on temperature and an activation energy of 64.0 kJ mol-1 has been derived. Lipid membranes can be very efficient inhibitors of Gvh-haemolysis, being able to bind the toxin quite avidly. The inhibitory effect requires the presence of cholesterol and it is stronger when cholesterol is mixed with negatively charged phospholipids rather than with zwitterionic phospholipids, suggesting that a negative surface potential increases the affinity of the toxin for the lipid bilayer. The functional properties of Gvh have been compared with those of Clostridium perfringens thetatoxin (PFO) and Escherichia coli haemolysin (HlyA), which are representative of widespread haemolysins produced by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The toxin shares several features with the family of the so-called 'sulphydryl-activated' cytolysins produced by Gram-positive bacteria, although Gvh does not truly belong to this family, being deactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol and being antigenically distinct from them. We report here for the first time the detection in the vaginal fluid of infected women of a specific IgA response against the toxin.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequencing, and expression of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A complete copy of the gene (cpe) encoding Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), an important virulence factor involved in C. perfringens food poisoning and other gastrointestinal illnesses, has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The cpe gene was shown to encode a 319-amino-acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular weight of 35,317. There was no consensus sequence for a typical signal peptide present in the 5' region of cpe. Cell lysates from recombinant cpe-positive E. coli were shown by quantitative immunoblot analysis to contain moderate amounts of CPE, and this recombinant CPE was equal to native CPE in cytotoxicity for mammalian Vero cells. CPE expression in recombinant E. coli appeared to be largely driven from a clostridial promoter. Immunoblot analysis also demonstrated very low levels of CPE in vegetative cell lysates of enterotoxin-positive C. perfringens. However, when the same C. perfringens strain was induced to sporulate, much stronger CPE expression was detected in these sporulating cells than in either vegetative C. perfringens cells or recombinant E. coli. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that sporulation is not essential for cpe expression, but sporulation does facilitate high-level cpe expression.
TI  - Sequential study of bacterial antibody levels and faecal flora in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking sulphasalazine.
AB  - Faecal and serum samples were collected from 31 patients with active RA during treatment with DMARD sulphasalazine (SASP). These were examined for changes in faecal flora and antibodies to bacterial antigens respectively. Faecal counts of Clostridium perfrigens but not Escherichia coli or total aerobic or anaerobic counts fell significantly after 2 weeks of treatment, this decrease being maintained throughout the treatment period. There was, however, no relationship between changes in the faecal carriage of this micro-organism and response to drug treatment, as assessed using clinical and biochemical indicators of disease activity. Changes in antibody levels to antigen preparations of this organism were also unrelated to response to drug treatment. These results suggest that the anti-rheumatic properties of SASP are independent of its antibacterial effect on bacteria in the bowel and also that neither faecal carriage of, nor antibody responses to this bacterium are involved in disease pathogenesis. Antibody levels to an antigen preparation of Cl. perfringens were found to be significantly lower in those patients who respond well to SASP than those patients who show poor response; this may prove useful as a clinical marker for predicting those patients likely to respond to SASP therapy.
TI  - Application of polymerase chain reaction for the correlation of Salmonella serovars recovered from greyhound feces with their diet.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction was employed to correlate Salmonella serovars isolated from fecal material of greyhounds suffering from gastroenteritis with those isolated from the diet fed to the greyhounds prior to onset of diarrhea. Kennels around the Abilene, Kansas, area were contacted and supplied with materials needed to collect a portion of the diet each day. With the onset of diarrhea, the kennels were instructed to ship the fecal material and diet from the previous 10 days to the laboratory for testing. Forty-one fecal samples and corresponding diets were screened for Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, and pathogenic (piliated) Escherichia coli by direct culture using standard procedures. The fecal material was also screened for coronavirus and parvovirus using electron microscopy. Thirty-five "normal" fecal samples were screened for all of the above mentioned microorganisms as a control. In addition, the fecal material was screened for E. coli verotoxins I and II and clostridial enterotoxins. A total of 61 Salmonella isolates were recovered from the 41 samples of feces and diet submitted for testing; 31 were recovered from the feces and 30 from the diet. Four Salmonella isolates were recovered from the normal fecal samples. Results obtained by PCR, plasmid profiles, antigenic analysis, and antibiogram profiles indicated that 16 of the 31 isolates recovered from the fecal material were the same strain as that recovered from the diet.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a phage-plasmid hybrid (phagemid), pCAK1, containing the replicative form of viruslike particle CAK1 isolated from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444.
AB  - A bacteriophage-plasmid hybrid (phagemid) designated pCAK1 was constructed by ligating 5-kbp Escherichia coli plasmid pAK102 (AprEmr) and the 6.6-kbp HaeIII-linearized replicative form of the CAK1 viruslike particle from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 6444. Phagemid pCAK1 (11.6 kbp) replicated via the ColE1 replication origin derived from pAK102 in E. coli. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules complexed with protein in a manner which protected ssDNA from nucleases were recovered from the supernatant of E. coli DH11S transformants containing pCAK1 in the absence of cell lysis. This suggests that the viral-strand DNA synthesis replication origin of CAK1 and associated gene expression are functional in E. coli DH11S. The single-stranded form of pCAK1 isolated from E. coli supernatant was transformed into E. coli DH5 alpha' or DH11S by electroporation. Isolation of ampicillin-resistant E. coli transformants following transformation suggests that the complementary-strand DNA synthesis replication origin of CAK1 is also functional in E. coli. The coat proteins associated with ssDNA of pCAK1 demonstrated sensitivity to proteinase K and various solvents (i.e., phenol and chloroform), similar to the results obtained previously with CAK1. Following phagemid construction in E. coli, pCAK1 was transformed into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and C. perfringens 13 by intact cell electroporation. Restriction enzyme analysis of pCAK1 isolated from erythromycin-resistant transformants of both C. acetobutylicum and C. perfringens suggested that it was identical to that present in E. coli transformants.
TI  - Fatal Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli sepsis following urea-instillation abortion.
AB  - Intraamniotic instillation of urea is a common mode of legal second-trimester pregnancy termination. Associated mortality rarely occurs and is most commonly due to amniotic fluid embolism, pulmonary thromboembolism, infection, hemorrhage, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We present the case of an 18-year-old gravida 2, para 1 white woman at 18 weeks' gestation who underwent intraamniotic instillation of hyperosmolar urea and intracervical insertion of laminaria tents; 19 h later, she became unresponsive, academic, and went into shock. Coagulation studies were diagnostic of DIC. Bacilli were seen on peripheral blood smear. Autopsy showed marked subcutaneous emphysema of the anterior abdominal wall, necrosis and emphysema of the uterus, diffuse pulmonary alveolar damage, and renal cortical necrosis. Antemortem blood cultures grew Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli. Postmortem culture of the uterus grew E. coli. The source of infection was most likely the introduction of vaginal organisms via laminaria insertion. This is apparently the first reported case of death caused by Clostridium perfringens and E. coli sepsis following urea instillation.
TI  - Biochemical and immunological properties of the C-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The C-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin (cpa247-370) of Clostridium perfringens  has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Antiserum raised against cpa247-370 reacted in an identical manner to anti-alpha-toxin serum when used to map epitopes in the C-terminal domain, suggesting that cpa247-370 was immunologically and structurally identical to this region in the alpha-toxin. The isolated cpa247-370 was devoid of sphingomyelinase activity or haemolytic activity and was not cytotoxic for mouse lymphocytes. Haemolytic activity was detected when cpa247-370 was tested with the N-terminal domain of the alpha-toxin (cpa1-249), confirming that cpa247-370 confers haemolytic properties on the phospholipase C activity of the alpha-toxin. Haemolytic activity was not detected if cpa247-370 was tested with the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C, nor if cpa1-249 and cpa247-370 were incubated sequentially with erythrocytes.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens emphysematous cystitis.
AB  - Emphysematous cystitis is a rare disease and is usually caused by aerobic bacteria, most commonly Escherichia coli. Only rarely have anaerobic bacteria been associated with this condition. We report a case of emphysematous cystitis due to Clostridium perfringens with bacteremia in an elderly diabetic woman.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors that carry single antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  - Two versatile Clostridium perfringens-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors were constructed. Each plasmid carried a single antibiotic resistance gene which was expressed in both organisms. The plasmid pJIR750 encoded resistance to chloramphenicol and pJIR751 encoded resistance to erythromycin. Each plasmid contained the pUC18-derived multiple cloning site and the lacZ' gene which enabled direct screening for recombinants in E. coli. These plasmids should prove invaluable for the genetic manipulation of C. perfringens.

TI  - The enteritis complex in domestic rabbits: A field study.
AB  - A study of the causative agents of enteritis in domestic rabbits from 44 different accessions is described. In descending order of frequency, the organisms most commonly demonstrated were intestinal and hepatic coccidia (Eimeria species), Escherichia coli, Clostridium spp., Salmonella, Bacillus piliformis, and rotavirus. The species of Eimeria identified included those moderately pathogenic and coccidia of low pathogenicity. Using seven antisera against known enterpathogenic strains of E. coli, only one strain, O15, was identified in three cases. Clostridium perfringens or C. spiroforme was demonstrated in the intestinal contents in 11 cases, and lesions compatible with clostridial enteropathy were identified on gross and histopathology. In a serological survey, over 50% of 200 fryer rabbits submitted to Ontario abattoirs and of animals from commercial rabbitries had detectable antibody to rotavirus, indicating the widespread distribution of rotaviral infections in this species. In the cases of enteritis studied, two or more potentially pathogenic organisms were frequently identified, emphasizing that several different organisms may be acting in concert to produce clinical disease.
TI  - Comparison of the alpha-toxin genes of Clostridium perfringens type A and C strains: evidence for extragenic regulation of transcription.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens plc gene encoding phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) was cloned from type C NCIB 10662, a strain which produces low levels of phospholipase C activity. The nucleotide sequence of a cloned 3.1-kb HindIII fragment was determined. The same fragment was also cloned from type A NCTC 8237, a phospholipase C-overproducing strain. In this case, an open reading frame (ORF2) truncated in the previously cloned 2-kb fragment was also sequenced. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence between the 3.1-kb fragments of the two type strains shows some differences both in the plc gene and in ORF2. However, when the 3.1-kb fragment was cloned into plasmid pUC19 and expressed in Escherichia coli, the plc genes from both type strains were similarly expressed and the toxins produced showed similar levels of activity. Northern blot analysis revealed that the type A strain produced 16 to 23 times more plc mRNA than the type C strain. These results indicate that in C. perfringens the two plc genes are transcribed at different rates, probably because of a difference in a locus lying outside of the cloned fragments. Gel retardation analysis showed that the type A strain possessed two different proteins that bound different regions of the plc gene. However, one of these proteins, which binds within the plc coding region, was not found in the type C strain, suggesting that it plays a role in the regulation of the plc gene expression.
TI  - Effect of hyperbaric oxygen and surgery on experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene.
AB  - An experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene rat model was developed and the therapeutic effect of surgery was compared to the combined effect of surgery and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). The infection was caused by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of bacteria including Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The mortality, morbidity and wound healing were assessed during a follow-up of 2 weeks. The mortality of the control rats was 60%, with rats treated with surgery alone 35% and the combined treatment group 20% (NS). In the combined treatment group, 84.4% of the survivors healed completely; the corresponding figure in the surgery group was 15.4% (p < 0.001). In experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene the addition of HBO to surgery reduces morbidity and improves wound healing but does not reduce mortality statistically significantly.
TI  - Characterization of Tn1546, a Tn3-related transposon conferring glycopeptide resistance by synthesis of depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursors in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Sequence determination of the flanking regions of the vancomycin resistance van gene cluster carried by pIP816 in Enterococcus faecium BM4147 revealed similarity to transposons of the Tn3 family. Imperfect inverted repeats (36 of 38 bp) delineated a 10,851-bp element designated Tn1546. The 4-kb region located upstream from the vanR gene contained two open reading frames (ORF) transcribed in opposite directions. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORF1 (988 residues) displayed, respectively, 56 and 42% identity to those of the transposases of Tn4430 from Bacillus thuringiensis and of Tn917 from Enterococcus faecalis. The product of ORF2 (191 residues) was related to the resolvase of Tn917 (33% amino acid identity) and to the Res protein (48%) of plasmid pIP404 from Clostridium perfringens. Tn1546 transposed consecutively in Escherichia coli from plasmid pUC18 into pOX38 and from pOX38 into various sites of pBR329. Transposition was replicative, led to the formation of cointegrates, and produced a 5-bp duplication at the target site. Southern hybridization and DNA amplification revealed the presence of Tn1546-related elements in enterococci highly resistant to glycopeptides. Analysis of sequences surrounding these elements indicated that transposition plays a role in dissemination of the van gene cluster among replicons of human clinical isolates of E. faecium.
TI  - Hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of gas gangrene and perineal necrotizing fasciitis. A clinical and experimental study.
AB  - Between 1971 and 1987, 32 patients with clostridial gas gangrene were treated in  the Department of Surgery, University of Turku. A presumptive diagnosis of gas gangrene was made on the basis of the clinical appearance of the patient and a predominance of Gram positive rods on stain. Between 1973 and 1989, 11 patients with perineal necrotizing fasciitis (Fournier's gangrene) were treated. The diagnosis was based on fulminating progression of perineal gangrene and on the presence of multiple pathogenic organisms in the primary Gram stain or culture. All patients in both series underwent surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and intensive care. In addition, the patients were exposed to pure oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute pressure (ATA) for 120 minutes. Three such treatments were given during the first 24 hours after admission after which the treatment was repeated twice daily. Seventeen patients with clostridial gas gangrene had diffusely spreading myonecrosis; 6 died. Fifteen patients developed clostridial cellulitis with toxicity; 3 died. Thus, the overall mortality in gas gangrene was 28%. All the 9 patients who died had been transferred from other hospitals in Finland and were moribund on arrival. The infection in 8 of these patients developed postoperatively. None of the patients with a posttraumatic infection died. Each of the patients with Fournier's gangrene had had nonspecific symptoms before the gangrene became evident. The infection originated from the anorectal area in 5 patients, 1 patient had sustained a scrotal trauma and in 5 patients the underlying condition was unknown. One patient died 2 days after admission. Six patients required a colostomy. To evaluate the therapeutic value of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment, two experimental models of clostridial gas gangrene, mono- and multimicrobial, were developed in rats. In the monomicrobial infection model, 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) of Clostridium perfringens were injected intramuscularly into the left hind limb of the rat. The mortality of untreated rats was 100%. The mortality of the rats treated with surgery alone was 38% compared to 13% when surgery was used in combination with HBO (p < 0.01; chi 2 test). In the group treated with HBO and surgery, 94% of the survivors healed completely and were able to walk normally, whereas the corresponding figure in the rats treated with surgery alone was 20% (p < 0.001; chi 2-test). In the multimicrobial gas gangrene model the infection was induced by an intramuscular injection of a mixture containing approximately 10(7) cfu of each of the following bacteria: Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Physical map of the Listeria monocytogenes chromosome.
AB  - The circular physical map of the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes LO28 (serovar 1/2c) was established by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The L. monocytogenes chromosome contains eight NotI fragments of 1,100, 940, 400, 335, 280, 45, 30, and 20 kb in size and eight Sse8387I fragments of 860, 680, 680, 370, 335, 130, 70, and 25 kb. Therefore, the total length of the genome is 3,150 kb. To order the NotI fragments on the chromosome, we used a strategy which can be of general use. We first cloned chromosomal HindIII or EcoRI fragments in pBR322. DNA extracted from the total libraries was digested by NotI and ligated to a NotI-kanamycin resistance cassette obtained by cutting Tn5 with NotI. After transformation in Escherichia coli, kanamycin-resistant clones originating from NotI-containing EcoRI or HindIII fragments were isolated. The two EcoRI-NotI or HindIII-NotI fragments of each recombinant plasmid were isolated and used as probes on Southern blot hybridizations to identify and link the corresponding NotI fragments. Seven NotI fragments were ordered in this way. The last junction was demonstrated by partial digest analysis. All L. monocytogenes genes identified so far as well as the six rRNA operons were localized on the NotI map. Regions homologous to genes from closely related bacteria were also detected and localized. Southern blot analysis of simple Sse8387I digests or double Sse8387I-NotI digests probed with the various NotI probes allowed us to align the Sse8387I fragments and localize the single SfiI site, resulting in the establishment of the first genetic and physical map of the L. monocytogenes chromosome.
TI  - Effects of site-specific mutations on the enzymatic properties of a sialidase from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Three site-specific mutations were performed in two regions of a sialidase gene from Clostridium perfringens which are known to be conserved in bacterial sialidases. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and, when measured with MU-Neu5Ac as substrate, exhibited variations in enzymatic properties compared with the wild-type enzyme. The conservative substitution of Arg 37 by Lys, located in a short conserved region upstream from the four repeated sequences common in bacterial sialidase genes, was of special interest, as KM and Vmax, as well as K(i) measured with Neu5Ac2en, were dramatically changed. These data suggest that this residue may be involved in substrate binding. In addition to its low activity, this mutant enzyme has a lower temperature optimum and is active over a more limited pH range. This mutation also prevents the binding of an antibody able to inhibit the wild-type sialidase. The other mutations, located in one of the consensus sequences, were of lower influence on enzyme activity and recognition by antibodies.
TI  - High-level production and purification of Escherichia coli N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase (EC 4.1.3.3).
AB  - The Escherichia coli gene which encodes N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase was isolated by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the inducible expression vector pTTQ18, and overexpressed in E. coli. The high yield of aldolase was achieved through both optimum growth of cells and efficient expression of the aldolase gene (20-30% soluble cellular protein). The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity with an activity of 1.2-2.2 U/mg, which compared favorably with that of commercial preparations of E. coli aldolase (1.1 U/mg) and Clostridium perfringens aldolase (0.4 U/mg). The cloning strategy, fermentation conditions, purification protocol, and activity assay are described.
TI  - Production of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa neuraminidase is increased under hyperosmolar conditions and is regulated by genes involved in alginate expression.
AB  - The pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex process attributed to specific characteristics of both the host and the infecting organism. In this study, the properties of the PAO1 neuraminidase were examined to determine its potential role in facilitating Pseudomonas colonization of the respiratory epithelium. The PAO1 neuraminidase was 1000-fold more active than the Clostridium perfringens enzyme in releasing sialic acid from respiratory epithelial cells. This effect correlated with increased adherence of PAO1 to epithelial cells after exposure to PAO1 neuraminidase and was consistent with in vitro studies demonstrating Pseudomonas adherence to asialoganglioside receptors. The regulation of the neuraminidase gene nanA was examined in Pseudomonas and as cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. In hyperosmolar conditions neuraminidase expression was increased by 50% (P less than 0.0004), an effect which was OmpR dependent in E. coli. In Pseudomonas the osmotic regulation of neuraminidase production was dependent upon algR1 and algR2, genes involved in the transcriptional activation of algD, which is responsible for the mucoid phenotype of Pseudomonas and pathognomonic for chronic infection in CF. Under the hyperosmolar conditions postulated to exist in the CF lung, nanA is likely to be expressed to facilitate the initial adherence of Pseudomonas to the respiratory tract.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We attempted to characterize the natural history of necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva. STUDY DESIGN: The records of 29 nonpregnant women with necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva were evaluated. RESULTS: These women experienced a rapidly progressing polymicrobial infection. Initially, the infections in many women were thought to be labial cellulitis, appearing mild and innocuous. Delays in recognition and aggressive surgical management were associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Of 15 women with a delay greater than 48 hours between presentation and treatment, 11 died. Twenty of 29 (69%) were diabetic, accounting for 11 of the 14 deaths. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement in spite of mild symptoms will improve outcome in this serious disease process.
TI  - Construction of a sequenced Clostridium perfringens-Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid.
AB  - A new Clostridium perfringens-Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid has been constructed and its complete DNA sequence compiled. The vector, pJIR418, contains the replication regions from the C. perfringens replicon pIP404 and the E. coli vector pUC18. The multiple cloning site and lacZ' gene from pUC18 are also present, which means that X-gal screening can be used to select recombinants in E. coli. Both chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance can be selected in C. perfringens and E. coli since pJIR418 carries the C. perfringens catP and ermBP genes. Insertional inactivation of either the catP or ermBP genes can also be used to directly screen recombinants in both organisms. The versatility of pJIR418 and its applicability for the cloning of toxin genes from C. perfringens have been demonstrated by the manipulation of a cloned gene encoding the production of phospholipase C.
TI  - High mortality of domestic turkeys associated with Ascaridia dissimilis.
AB  - Third- and fourth-stage Ascaridia dissimilis larvae were isolated from commercial white turkey intestinal scrapings from two farms that were experiencing high mortality. Lesions consisted of a necrotic-like enteritis that was most severe in the jejunum. Subsequent bacteriological isolation yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. The rate of mortality declined rapidly when the turkeys were administered 18 ppm fenbendazole for 7 days.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and distribution of the Salmonella typhimurium LT2 sialidase  gene, nanH, provides evidence for interspecies gene transfer.
AB  - The Salmonella typhimurium LT2 sialidase (neuraminidase, EC 3.2.1.18) structural  gene, nanH, has been cloned and sialidase overproduced from multicopy plasmids in Escherichia coli. Sialidase expression was regulated positively by cAMP. In contrast, certain Tn1000 insertions located upstream of nanH coding sequences reduced sialidase activity. A nanH chromosomal insertion mutation constructed by marker exchange demonstrated a single sialidase gene copy in S. typhimurium LT2. The complete nucleotide sequence of nanH, encoding a 41,300 dalton polypeptide, was determined and the derived primary structure was similar to sialidases from Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sordellii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Comparative sequence analysis, including codon usage and secondary structure predictions, indicated that the S. typhimurium and clostridial sialidases are homologous, strongly suggestive of an interspecies gene transfer event. At least two primary sequence motifs of the bacterial enzymes were detected in influenza A virus sialidases. The predicted secondary structure of the bacterial enzymes was strikingly similar to viral sialidase. From the population distribution of nanH detected within a collection of salmonellae, it was apparent that S. typhimurium obtained its nanH copy most recently from Salmonella arizonae. S. typhimurium LT2 is thus a genetic mosaic that differs from other strains of even the same serotype by nanH plus potentially additional characters linked to nanH. These results have relevance to the evolution and function of sialidases in pathogenic microbes, and to the origin of the sialic acids.
TI  - Physical and genetic mapping of the genomes of five Mycoplasma hominis strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - We present the complete maps of five Mycoplasma hominis genomes, including a detailed restriction map and the locations of a number of genetic loci. The restriction fragments were resolved by field inversion gel electrophoresis or by the contour-clamped homogeneous-electric-field system of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All the ApaI, SmaI, BamHI, XhoI, and SalI restriction sites (total of 21 to 33 sites in each strain) were placed on the physical map, yielding an average resolution of 26 kb. The maps were constructed using three different approaches: (i) size determination of DNA fragments partially or completely cleaved with one or two restriction enzymes, (ii) hybridization analysis with purified restriction fragments and specific probes, and (iii) use of linking clones. A genetic map was constructed by hybridization with gene-specific probes for rpoA, rpoC, rrn, tuf, gyrB, hup, ftsY, the unc operon, the genes for two M. hominis-specific antigenic membrane proteins, and one gene encoding a protein with some homology to Escherichia coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase. The positions of mapped loci were partially conserved in the five strains except in one strain in which a 300-kb fragment was inverted. The numbers and order of mapped restriction sites were only partly conserved, and this conservation was restricted to certain regions. The gene order was compared with the gene order established for other bacteria and was found to be identical to that of the phylogenetically related Clostridium perfringens. The genome size of the M. hominis strains varied from 704 to 825 kb.
TI  - Seasonal effects on accumulation of microbial indicator organisms by Mercenaria mercenaria.
AB  - The ability of hard-shelled clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) to accumulate fecal coliforms and other microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and male-specific bacteriophages) was determined over a 1-year period. Twenty separate trails were conducted during different seasons to encompass a wide range of water temperatures. The greatest accumulation of microorganisms in hard-shelled clams occurred during certain periods in the spring, at temperatures ranging from 11.5 to 21.5 degrees C. These periods of hyperaccumulation did not always coincide for all organisms; the accumulation of bacteriophages was not predicted by the accumulation of either fecal coliforms or C. perfringens. Bacteriophages and C. perfringens showed significantly higher rates of accumulation than either the fecal coliform group or E. coli, especially during the spring. The higher incidence of human viral gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of shellfish during this period may be a result of the extraordinary concentration of certain microorganisms, including enteric viral pathogens.
TI  - Cloning of tetracycline-resistance genes from various strains of Clostridium perfringens and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - One hundred strains of Clostridium perfringens and 52 strains of other clostridia of human and animal origins were screened for tetracycline resistance. Fifty-six strains were resistant to tetracycline in the C. perfringens group. Ten strains were selected for their high level of resistance. In all of them, the tetracycline-resistance genes were found to be residing in large plasmids of about 50 kb, all showing homologies. Several tetracycline-resistance genes from plasmids of various strains of C. perfringens were cloned in plasmid pUC19 and the resistance was expressed in Escherichia coli. Hybridization analysis showed these genes to be homologous among themselves and also to tetP gene from the PCW3-type plasmid.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin gene and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The sequence of 20 amino acids from the N terminus of Clostridium perfringens epsilon-toxin was determined. Some differences between this sequence and the previously published sequence (A. S. Bhown and A. F. S. A. Habeeb, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 78:889-896, 1977) were found. A degenerate 23-bp pair oligonucleotide probe was designed from the amino acid sequence data and used to isolate a DNA fragment containing the gene encoding epsilon-toxin (etx) from C. perfringens type B. The gene encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 32,981. Upstream of the gene, promoter sequences which resembled the Escherichia coli sigma 70 consensus sequences were identified. The gene was expressed in E. coli, and the cloned gene product reacted with epsilon-toxin-specific monoclonal antibodies and had a molecular weight and isoelectric point similar to those of the native protein. Downstream of etx, two overlapping open reading frames were identified. Each encoded part of a protein which was homologous to the transposase from Staphylococcus aureus transposon Tn4001. Southern hybridization experiments indicated that the etx gene was found only in C. perfringens types B and D, the types which produce epsilon-toxin.
TI  - Role of the upstream region containing an intrinsic DNA curvature in the negative regulation of the phospholipase C gene of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) gene (plc) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into pUC19 and the effects of the upstream regions on expression of the plc gene were examined in Escherichia coli JM109. When the 0.7-kb region just upstream of the putative -35 site of the gene was deleted, production of phospholipase C increased approximately 10-fold. Northern blot hybridization analysis of the plc transcript showed that the upstream region inhibited transcription from the plc promoter. Nucleotide sequencing of this upstream region revealed that there are three periodically repeated (dA)5-6 tracts between positions -66 and -40 of the plc gene. A fragment containing this sequence showed anomalously slow electrophoretic mobility at low temperature, indicating that the region immediately upstream of the plc promoter is a locus of sequence directed DNA-bending. Nested deletions of the upstream region were created from its 5' end by exonuclease III and the effects of deletions on the expression of the plc gene were examined. When the 77-bp fragment containing the two (dA)5-6 tracts were deleted, phospholipase C production increased markedly. These results indicate that the intrinsic DNA curvature upstream of the plc promoter is involved in the negative regulation of the plc gene transcription.
TI  - [Bacterial translocation in Crohn disease].
AB  - Bacterial translocation is the passage of viable endogenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to mesenteric lymph nodes and other internal organs. The aim of this work was to study bacterial translocation in patients operated on for Crohn's disease. Twenty-eight patients, mean age 29 years, not having received any antibiotics since at least 8 days, presenting with ileal (n = 12), ileo-colonic (n = 14) or colonic (n = 2) Crohn's disease were studied. In 25 out of 28 cases (89%) indication for surgery was strictures inducing an upper small bowel distension in 9 out of 25 patients. Mesenteric lymph nodes and liver biopsies, portal blood samples and peritoneum swabs were harvested after laparotomy and before gut opening. Bacterial translocation, defined as the presence of intestinal bacteria in at least one of the specimens, was present in 8 out of 28 patients. This was found in lymph nodes draining surgical territories in 7 out of 8 cases. Bacterial strains involved in translocation included E. coli (n = 5), Enterococcus (n = 3), Clostridium perfringens (n = 2), Proteus (n = 2), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). The rate of translocation differed neither according to Crohn's disease site nor with perforating or non perforating type of the disease. Five out of 9 patients operated on for strictures with proximal distension had a translocation. In conclusion, bacterial translocation was identified in 29% of patients operated on for Crohn's disease in this series. Distension of the intestine proximal to a digestive stricture could favor the occurrence of bacterial translocation in Crohn's disease.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence of a putative membrane transport gene from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A gene from Clostridium perfringens encoding a highly hydrophobic polypeptide of  M(r) = 30,698 was cloned and sequenced. The polypeptide showed similarities with the inner membrane proteins of binding protein-dependent transport systems of the gram negative enterobacteria. The sequence homology to the UgpE and MalG proteins of Escherichia coli was 27.6%, or 60.4 and 52.2%, respectively, taking into account the conservative amino acid changes. The polypeptide contained the EAA---G---------(I/V)-LP motif of the gram negative transport proteins. This motif may thus be very old, as clostridia and E. coli separated some 1.5 x 10(9) years ago. The similarities suggest a common evolutionary origin of these genes.
TI  - [Bacteria associated with diarrheic episodes in young camels in Niger].
AB  - During diarrhoeic episodes of young camels in Niger, bacteria such as Salmonella  enteritidis, E. Coli, Staphylococcus sp., Clostridium perfringens and other bacteria were isolated from stool samples. Bacteria roll in this pathology is discussed, and a treatment is proposed, compared with antibiogram results.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lecithinase operon of Listeria monocytogenes and possible role of lecithinase in cell-to-cell spread.
AB  - The lecithinase gene of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, plcB,  was identified in a 5,648-bp DNA fragment which expressed lecithinase activity when cloned into Escherichia coli. This fragment is located immediately downstream of the previously identified gene mpl (prtA). It contains five open reading frames, named actA, plcB, and ORFX, -Y, and -Z, which, together with mpl, form an operon, since a 5.7-kb-long transcript originates from a promoter located upstream of mpl (J. Mengaud, C. Geoffroy, and P. Cossart, Infect. Immun. 59:1043-1049, 1991). A second promoter was detected in front of actA which encodes a putative membrane protein containing a region of internal repeats. plcB encodes the lecithinase, a predicted 289-amino-acid protein homologous to the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipases C of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens (alpha-toxin). plcB mutants produce only small plaques on fibroblast monolayers, and an electron microscopic analysis of infected macrophages suggests that lecithinase is involved in the lysis of the two-membrane vacuoles that surround the bacteria after cell-to-cell spread. On the opposite DNA strand, downstream of the operon, three more open reading frames, ldh, ORFA, and ORFB, were found. The deduced amino acid sequence of the first one is homologous to lactate dehydrogenases. Low-stringency Southern hybridization experiments suggest that these three open reading frames lie outside of the L. monocytogenes virulence region: mpl and actA were specific for L. monocytogenes, sequences hybridizing to plcB were detected in L. ivanovii and L. seeligeri, and sequences hybridizing to ORFX, -Y, and -Z were found in L. innocua. In contrast to this, sequences hybridizing to ldh or ORFB were detected in all Listeria species (including the nonpathogenic ones).
TI  - Local beneficial effect of coumarin in experimental peritonitis.
AB  - Coumarin, a potent immune stimulant and macrophage activator, has been used to treat brucellosis and as an immune suppressor. The effect of Coumarin and systemic antibiotics on septicaemia, survival and peritoneal contamination in experimental peritonitis was assessed. Four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were inoculated with Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. Group A received saline alone, Group B received Coumarin alone, Group C received antibiotics (Clindamycin and Cephradine) alone and Group D received both Coumarin and antibiotics. Septicaemia, confirmed by blood culture, occurred in all animals. Coumarin did not improve survival whether given alone or in combination with antibiotics. Animals given Coumarin (Groups B and D) had significantly less peritoneal soiling (54%, 0%) (P less than 0.02, P less than 0.001) than their controls (Groups A and C: 92%; 29%). While Coumarin did not improve resistance to septicaemia it did exert a local beneficial effect.
TI  - A study of the bacterial and parasitic causes of acute diarrhoea in northern Jordan.
AB  - The prevalence of bacterial and parasitic diarrhoeagenic agents in 200 patients suffering from acute diarrhoea and reporting to hospitals and health centres in northern Jordan, and in controls was determined. One or more bacterial or parasitic enteropathogens was isolated from 79 patients (39.5%). Prevalence rates for these pathogens was as follows: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, 9%; enteropathogenic E. coli, 9%; Salmonella spp. 7%; Campylobacter spp, 5.5%; Yersinia enterocolitica, 4.5%; Shigella spp, 4%; Aeromonas spp, 3.5%; enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 2%; Vibrio spp, 2%; and Plesiomonas shigelloides, 0.5%. Both Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica were detected in 2% of the stool samples examined. Although the determination of the aetiologic role of the identified enteropathogens was complicated by more than one factor, the data collected will serve as a baseline for future studies of the subject.
TI  - Molecular genetics and pathogenesis of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is the causative agent of a number of human diseases, such as gas gangrene and food poisoning, and many diseases of animals. Recently significant advances have been made in the development of C. perfringens genetics. Studies on bacteriocin plasmids and conjugative R plasmids have led to the cloning and analysis of many C. perfringens genes and the construction of shuttle plasmids. The relationship of antibiotic resistance genes to similar genes from other bacteria has been elucidated. A detailed physical map of the C. perfringens chromosome has been prepared, and numerous genes have been located on that map. Reproducible transformation methods for the introduction of plasmids into C. perfringens have been developed, and several genes coding for the production of extracellular toxins and enzymes have been cloned. Now that it is possible to freely move genetic information back and forth between C. perfringens and Escherichia coli, it will be possible to apply modern molecular methods to studies on the pathogenesis of C. perfringens infections.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of potable water sources supplying Morogoro municipality  and its outskirts: a case study in Tanzania.
AB  - Bacteriological quality of potable water supplying Morogoro municipality and its  outskirts (population 135,000 people) was assessed by the determination of the most probable number (MPN) of faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and Clostridium perfringens for a period of 6 months. River water and chlorinated pipeborne water were found contaminated with microorganisms in the order of 3.8 x 10(1) to 4.95 x 10(3); 3.2 x 10(1) to 4.5 x 10(3); 10(1) to 6.4 x 10(1) and 1.2 x 10(1) to 2.5 x 10(2)/100 ml of water respectively. Injured coliforms in treated water averaged 87%. Pollution of river water by organic matter was much above acceptable standard. These findings indicate that there is a need for further treatment of water before consumption in order to avoid potential health hazards.
TI  - The prevalence of enteric pathogens in diarrhoeic thoroughbred foals in Britain and Ireland.
AB  - A survey of 77 normal and 326 diarrhoeic foals in Britain and Ireland from 1987 to 1989 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of Group A rotaviruses and Aeromonas hydrophila in diarrhoeic foals. The prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Clostridium perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. Rotaviruses had a similar prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. The number of cases of diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. A comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to have similar sensitivity. The Rotazyme ELISA test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of EM and PAGE. A. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. A. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. Other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. No evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic E. coli. Neither coccidia nor non-Group A rotaviruses were found in any of the samples examined.
TI  - Optically detected triplet-state magnetic resonance studies of the DNA complexes  of the bisquinoline analogue of echinomycin.
AB  - The polymeric DNA and model duplex oligonucleotide complexes of the bisquinoline  analogue of echinomycin (2QN) have been studied by optical detection of triplet-state magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy, with the quinoline chromophores of the drug used as intrinsic probes. Plots of ODMR transition frequencies versus monitored wavelength revealed heterogeneity in the phosphorescence emission of 2QN which was ascribed to the presence of a major and minor conformation of the drug in aqueous solutions (referred to as the red and blue forms of 2QN, respectively, in this report). ODMR results, in conjunction with findings from low-temperature phosphorescence investigations, indicate that the quinoline chromophores of the major (red) form of 2QN are involved in aromatic stacking interactions in complexes with the natural DNAs from Escherichia coli, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Clostridium perfringens, and calf thymus as evidenced by red shifts in the phosphorescence 0,0-band of the drug, reductions in the phosphorescence lifetime and zero-field splitting (zfs) D and E parameters, and polarity reversals of the ODMR slow passage signals upon complex formation between the analogue and DNA. The polarity reversals, which reflect shifts in the triplet-state sublevel populations induced by complex formation, apparently result from changes in the triplet sublevel decay constants upon binding to the natural DNAs. The 2QN complexes of the double-stranded alternating copolymers poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) [abbreviated as poly[d(G-C)2]] and poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) [abbreviated as poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) [abbreviated as poly[d(A-T)2], the homopolymer duplexes poly(dG).poly(dC) [abbreviated as poly(dG.dC)] and poly(dA).poly(dT) [abbreviated as poly(dA.dT)], and the self-complementary oligonucleotides d(ACGT)2, d(TCGA)2, and d(ACGTACGT)2 were also investigated. The extent of reduction of the zfs D parameter (delta D) for the major form of 2QN upon complex formation with the polymeric DNAs was found to scale linearly with the standard free energy of the drug-DNA interaction (delta G degrees) calculated from previously reported binding studies for these targets [Fox, K. R., et al. (1980) Biochem. J. 191, 729-740]. This relationship between spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of the 2QN-polynucleotide complexes is a consequence of the effects of base stacking interactions on the electronic states of the intercalator, which were postulated to arise from second-order shifts of the ground-state and the triplet-state energies of the complex on the basis of a modification of the solvent effect theory of van Egmond et al. [(1975) Chem. Phys. Lett. 34, 423-426].
TI  - Effect of intraperitoneal administration of oxygen on the course of experimentally induced peritonitis.
AB  - Over the first 3 days of experimentally induced peritonitis, 40 rabbits were given oxygen intraperitoneally (IP) up to a pressure of 3 to 5 mm Hg in the peritoneal cavity at 12-hour intervals. Compared with a control group, significant differences were recorded in the mortality rate within the studied 7-day period of peritonitis (p less than 0.05). In 29 rabbits with intraperitoneal administration of oxygen, the size of the area that formed the inner wall of the abscess cavity was significantly smaller (p less than 0.01) on day 7 of peritonitis than in the control group. The number of samples obtained from the abscesses positive for Clostridium perfringens (p less than 0.05) and for Staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.001) was significantly lower in rabbits that had received intraperitoneal oxygen than in the control group. The number of samples from the abscesses positive for Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis was significantly lower in the control group than in the group with intraperitoneal administration of oxygen (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of oxygen has an effect on the mortality rate associated with peritonitis, the size of the intraperitoneal abscess, and the bacterial composition of these abscesses.
TI  - Cloning, mapping, and molecular characterization of the rRNA operons of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - All 10 rRNA operons have been situated on the genome map of the anaerobic pathogen Clostridium perfringens. Four of these have been cloned and partially sequenced, and their transcriptional patterns in vivo and in vitro have been examined. Expression of rrnA, rrnB, and rrnE is directed by tandem promoters, P1 and P2, whereas rrnH is the only one to be expressed from a single promoter, which resembles P1. On inspection of the nucleotide sequences of the control regions, several sites which might be involved in the regulation of rrn expression were identified. These include a possible upstream activating region which could be recognized by the C. perfringens equivalent of the Escherichia coli Fis protein and a stringent response target site. Studies of maturation of 16S RNA identified two 5' cleavage sites and sequence analysis showed the dG+dC content of its gene, rrs, to be 52%, which is twice that of the genome.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase encoded  by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus, was determined. The structural cat gene encoded a protein of 209 amino acids, which represented one monomer of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Comparisons between the amino acid sequences of the pSCS7-encoded CAT from S. aureus and the previously sequenced CAT variants from S. aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Bacillus pumilis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis were performed. An alignment of CAT amino acid sequences demonstrated the presence of 34 conserved amino acids among all CAT variants. These conserved residues were considered for their possible roles in the structure and function of CAT. On the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. It demonstrated relatively large evolutionary distances between the CAT variants of enteric bacteria, Clostridium, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus species.
TI  - Localization of the receptor-binding region of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin utilizing cloned toxin fragments and synthetic peptides. The 30 C-terminal amino acids define a functional binding region.
AB  - In this study a short sequence encoding the receptor-binding activity of the much larger 35-kDa enterotoxin elaborated by Clostridium perfringens was localized by recombinant DNA techniques. Defined fragments corresponding to portions of the enterotoxin gene were cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector system, and these lysates were analyzed for their ability to compete for binding with native C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). The lysate containing CPE290-319 (CPE sequence encompassing residues 290-319) was shown to compete with 125I-CPE for specific binding sites on rabbit intestinal brush border membranes. To confirm this finding, a peptide corresponding to the CPE amino acid sequence 290-319 was synthesized and found to completely block CPE specific binding. To demonstrate directly that CPE290-319 can act as a competitive antagonist of CPE cytotoxicity for physiologic receptors, Vero cells were preincubated with either E. coli lysates containing CPE290-319 or the synthetic peptide corresponding to this sequence. Preincubation of Vero cells with either the lysate or the peptide completely protected these cells from CPE challenge. This information localizes the C-terminal 30 residues of CPE (CPE290-319) as a linear sequence sufficient for recognition and binding to the eukaryotic CPE receptor.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  are dependent on a domain homologous to that of an enzyme from the human arachidonic acid pathway.
AB  - The N-terminal domain of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin, homologous with the nontoxic phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus, was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to retain all of the phosphatidylcholine hydrolyzing activity of the alpha-toxin, but not the sphingomyelinase, hemolytic, or lethal activities. The C-terminal domain of alpha-toxin showed sequence and predicted structural homologies with the N-terminal region of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme from the human arachidonic acid pathway which plays a role in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases in humans.
TI  - Kinetic aspects of the aggregation of Clostridium perfringens theta-toxin on erythrocyte membranes. A fluorescence energy transfer study.
AB  - Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to monitor aggregation kinetics of the "thiol-activated" cytolysin (perfringolysin O (PFO) or theta-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens on erythrocyte membranes. PFO was labeled with the isothiocyanate derivatives of either fluorescein or tetramethylrhodamine. No detectable change in the hemolytic activity of PFO was detected after modification with either fluorophore at a ratio of 1:2 fluorophore molecules/cytolysin molecule. Fluorescence energy transfer (FET) between the donor (fluorescein.PFO or PFOD) and the acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine.PFO or PFOA) was detected by both quenching of donor fluorescence (520 nm) and by enhancement of acceptor fluorescence (575 nm) upon aggregation of labeled cytolysin molecules. FET was only observed when PFOD and PFOA were incubated in the presence of membranes. FET was not observed when PFOD and PFOA were incubated in a membrane-free solution or when unlabeled toxin was substituted for PFOA. FET was also found to be temperature-dependent. The temperature-dependent rates of change in FET upon mixing labeled toxin with erythrocyte membranes proceeded without a lag phase and displayed an activation energy of 18.7 kcal/mol. At all temperatures aggregation of PFO was virtually complete before the onset of hemolysis, the latter exhibiting a distinct lag phase. The lag period before onset of hemolysis was temperature-dependent and exhibited an activation energy of 23.2 kcal/mol. These results suggest that the aggregation of membrane-associated PFO is necessary to initiate the hemolytic process, and the lag phase which occurs before onset of hemolysis reflects the kinetics of PFO monomer to polymer conversion.
TI  - The sialidase gene from Clostridium septicum: cloning, sequencing, expression in  Escherichia coli and identification of conserved sequences in sialidases and other proteins.
AB  - An oligonucleotide mixture corresponding to the codons for conserved and repeated amino acid sequences of bacterial sialidases (Roggentin et al. 1989) was used to clone a 4.3 kb PstI restriction fragment of Clostridium septicum DNA in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the sialidase gene was determined from this fragment. The derived amino acid sequence corresponds to a protein of 110,000 Da. The ribosomal binding site and promoter-like consensus sequences were identified upstream from the putative ATG initiation codon. The molecular and immunological properties of the sialidase expressed by E. coli are similar to those of the sialidase as isolated from C. septicum. The newly synthesized protein is assumed to include a leader peptide of 26 amino acids. On sequence alignment, the sialidases from C. septicum, C. sordellii and C. perfringens show significant homologies. As in other bacterial sialidases, conserved amino acid sequences occur at four positions in the protein. Aside from the consensus sequences, only poor homology to other bacterial and viral sialidases was found. The consensus sequence could be identified even in other, non-sialidase proteins, indicating a common function or the evolutionary relatedness of these proteins.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Population of Salmonella serovar typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens with Escherichia coli and intestinal bacteria.
AB  - To test the interaction between various species of bacteria and Salmonella serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium), the population of S. typhimurium was measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens in the presence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and one of the four intestinal bacteria; Lactobacillus acidophilus. Clostridium perfringens, Bifidobacterium thermophilum and Bacteroides vulgatus. Competitive exclusion of S. typhimurium by di-flora chicken was not demonstrated. But the population of S. typhimurium was temporarily suppressed in di-flora chickens with E. coli and L. acidophilus. In penta-flora chickens with E. coli and these four intestinal bacteria, the population of S. typhimurium was suppressed for only 2 days. In normalized chickens, the population of S. typhimurium was markedly suppressed.
TI  - Relationship between the Clostridium perfringens catQ gene product and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases from other bacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium perfringens chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-encoding resistance determinant, catQ, was determined. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 219 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,014 was identified. Although catQ was expressed constitutively, sequences similar in structure to those found upstream of inducible cat genes were observed. The catQ gene was distinct from the C. perfringens catP determinant. The deduced CATQ monomer had considerable amino acid sequence conservation compared with CATP (53% similarity) and other known CAT proteins (39 to 53%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CATQ monomer was as closely related to CAT proteins from Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter coli as it was to CAT monomers from the clostridia.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Hospital green salads and the effects of washing them.
AB  - Each week from April 1989 to February 1990, a plate of green salad prepared in the hospital kitchen was examined microbiologically. Of the 256 plates examined, 51% had total viable counts (TVCs) of greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (cfu) g-1. Staphylococcus aureus was present in 13 samples and Escherichia coli in one sample. No Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella spp. were isolated. The effect of washing mustard and cress, cucumber and the different layers of lettuce leaves was examined. Washing the salad by agitating it under running tap water in a colander for 2 min reduced the total bacterial counts by 10-fold. The inner leaves of a lettuce had TVCs less than 10(4)cfu g-1, at least 10-100-fold less than the outer leaves. Cucumber after washing had similar TVCs as after peeling. Five of six samples of mustard and cress had TVCs of at least 10(6)cfu g-1 before washing. As a consequence, mustard and cress was no longer used in our salads.
TI  - A recombinant, membrane-acting immunotoxin.
AB  - The anti-Tac antibody is known to bind to the p55 chain of the human interleukin  2 receptor. An immunotoxin was produced by genetically linking Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (PLC) to the Fab domain of anti-Tac. For this purpose, the PLC gene, with its own promoter and signal sequence, was fused to the 5' end of the VHCH1 segment of the anti-Tac heavy chain gene. The anti-Tac light chain gene, with an attached bacterial signal sequence, was made part of the same transcriptional unit. Escherichia coli transformed with the construct secreted a recombinant immunotoxin, anti-Tac(Fab)-PLC, in an active form. Anti-Tac(Fab)-PLC bound to cells expressing the interleukin 2 receptor and inhibited protein synthesis, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.02 nM (1.8 ng/ml).
TI  - Travelers' diarrhea among United States military personnel during joint American-Egyptian armed forces exercises in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - A study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a United States military population on deployment in Cairo, Egypt, during July and August 1987. Acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. A possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. Enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (17% ST-producers, 13% LT-producers, and 3% LT/ST-producers); Shigella (9%); Campylobacter spp. (2%); Salmonella (2%); and Vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). Other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included Aeromonas hydrophila group, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Bacillus cereus. Yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive E. coli, intoxications by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. A survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. Acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in U.S. military personnel deployed to Egypt.
TI  - A recombinant C-terminal toxin fragment provides evidence that membrane insertion is important for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin cytotoxicity.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) is believed to be involved in several important gastrointestinal illnesses. Recent studies have identified a number of distinct molecular events which occur after CPE treatment of eukaryotic cells or isolated membranes. Additional studies are underway to determine the temporal order and intrinsic importance of each CPE event for cytotoxicity. We now demonstrate that a truncated CPE fragment binds to membranes, but is unable to insert into membranes or cause any other subsequent post-insertion event. This is the first experimental evidence supporting the importance of membrane insertion for CPE cytotoxicity. Binding of the CPE fragment is also shown to be irreversible, strongly suggesting that the irreversible binding of wild-type CPE is not due solely to insertion of CPE into membranes.
TI  - An upstream regulatory sequence stimulates expression of the perfringolysin O gene of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The structural gene for perfringolysin O (pfoA), a thiol-activated hemolysin of Clostridium perfringens, was cloned into Escherichia coli JM109 on a 4.6-kilobase (kb) EcoRI-NdeI fragment which contained the 1.7-kb pfoA gene and an upstream 2.9-kb region. An E. coli strain transformed by this plasmid produced 20-fold more perfringolysin O than a strain containing only the 1.7-kb pfoA gene. The stimulatory effect of the upstream region on in vivo expression of the pfoA gene was further analyzed by using a set of deletion mutants. Stimulation was still observed with a 3.9-kb fragment, but stimulation was not observed with fragments that were 3.6 kb or less long, indicating that the upstream region between 3.9 and 1.7 kb was involved in activation of pfoA gene expression. Nucleotide sequencing showed that this region contained one open reading frame (pfoR) coding for 343 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of pfoR possesses several motifs that are characteristic of DNA-binding proteins. When a region coding for a helix-turn-helix, one of the most important motifs of DNA-binding proteins, was deleted within pfoR, stimulation was completely abolished. These results indicate that pfoR positively controls expression of the pfoA gene.
TI  - [Bacterial enterotoxins: structure, mode of action].
AB  - The enterotoxins are macro-proteins, produced by enterotoxic bacterial strains acting in the human or animal intestine during digestive infections. In most cases, they induce diarrhoea (associated or not with tissue damage). These molecules differ in their structure and mechanism of action. Some of them (cholera toxin, Escherichia coli LT) activate a cyclase system (adenylate or guanylate cyclase), inducing water and electrolyte flux in the gut. Conversely, others (toxins A and B, Clostridium difficile; Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin; verotoxin), provoke diarrhoea, intestinal damage associated with inflammatory response acting on cellular functions (protein synthesis, permeability to small molecules). Most enterotoxins act via membrane receptors which they specifically recognize on the surface of the enterocyte.
TI  - Virulence of clinical and fecal isolates of Clostridium perfringens type A for outbred NMRI mice.
AB  - Twelve clinical and 102 fecal isolates from healthy carriers of Clostridium perfringens type A were tested for virulence in juvenile, outbred NMRI mice (intramuscular route). There were marked differences (up to 1,000-fold) in virulence among strains of both groups of isolates. On average, clinical isolates were not more virulent than fecal isolates. Fresh epinephrine (10 micrograms/mouse and given concurrently with bacterial inocula) significantly augmented virulence. The murine model of Hill and Osterhout for experimental gas gangrene yielded reproducible results. Myelosuppressed (cyclophosphamide-pretreated) mice were somewhat more susceptible to C. perfringens as contrasted with mice that had been pretreated with either carrageenan type II or with zymosan. The murine virulence of C. perfringens was enhanced significantly by Escherichia coli.
TI  - Site-directed alteration of the active-site residues of histidine decarboxylase from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - To clarify the mechanism of biogenesis and catalysis by the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase (HisDCase) from Clostridium perfringens, 12 mutant genes encoding amino acid substitutions at the active site of this enzyme were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The resulting mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity, characterized, and subjected to kinetic analysis. The results (a) exclude all polar amino acid residues in the active site except Glu-214 as donor of the proton that replaces the carboxyl group of histidine during decarboxylation and, since E214I and E214H are nearly inactive, indicate that Glu-214 is the essential proton donor; (b) demonstrate the importance to substrate binding of hydrophobic interactions between Phe-98, Ile-74, and the imidazole ring of histidine, and of hydrogen bonding between Asp-78 and N2 of the substrate; and (c) demonstrate a significant unidentified role for Glu-81 in the maintenance of the active-site structure. The proposed roles of these amino acid residues are consistent with those assigned on the basis of crystallographic evidence to the corresponding residues at the active site of the related HisDCase from Lactobacillus 30a [Gallagher, T., Snell, E. E., & Hackert, M. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12737-12743]. Of the residues altered, only Ser-97 was essential for the autocatalytic serinolysis reaction by which this HisDCase, (alpha beta)6, is derived from its inactive, pyruvate-free precursor, proHisDCase, pi 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - Gnotobiotic, athymic mice; a possible system for the study of the role of bacteria in human amoebiasis.
AB  - Two groups of 12 + 14 gnotobiotic, athymic mice were intracaecally injected with  Entamoeba histolytica strain HK9 and NIH:200, respectively. Two groups of 16 and 15 mice were given amoebae together with a pure strain of Escherichia coli and a further two groups of 16 and 27 were given amoebae with a pure strain of Clostridium perfringens. Batches of 3-7 mice from each group were killed at intervals of 1-4 weeks. All the mice given NIH:200 alone were found to be infected with trophozoites. Of those given HK9 alone, 20% of the first and 57% of the second group to be examined were infected. Groups of mice given either strain of amoeba monocontaminated with E. coli were all found to be infected at post-mortem examination with no apparent clinical signs and little histological change. The group given HK9 and C. perfringens, although all were infected, failed to produce clinical signs or histological lesions, though some died expectedly. In the group given NIH:200 with C. perfringens the amoebae showed a change of activity and there was evidence of both caecal and liver lesions after 120 days. The usefulness of the system in studying the effect of individual species of bacteria on invasive amoebae is discussed.
TI  - Selective recognition of DNA antigenic determinants by murine monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies.
AB  - To assess the immune recognition of DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus, the antigenic specificity of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies from autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr mice was investigated Determinant specificity was assessed by ELISA in terms of binding to a panel of ssDNA antigens including calf thymus, human placenta, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, salmon testes, chicken blood and murine DNA. Among the monoclonal antibodies, a variety of binding patterns was observed, although for all antibodies tested murine DNA was among the most reactive antigens. Binding to other DNAs varied markedly, with some antibodies showing only low reactivity to certain antigens in the test panel. Similar results were obtained with sera of individual MRL-lpr/lpr mice. These results suggest that anti-DNA antibodies bind specific antigenic determinants variably expressed by DNAs of various species. Furthermore, the preferential binding to mouse DNA by some MRL-lpr/lpr antibodies may suggest a role of self-DNA in the in vivo selection of anti-DNA antibodies for expression.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - The role of Escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  - The growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (E. coli, Ent. faecalis, B. ovatis, F. varium and C. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when the E. coli strain was haemolytic. E. coli and B. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. When non-haemolytic E. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. The inclusion of partially purified E. coli haemolysin (125 HU50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic E. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. These results indicate that E. coli haemolysin is one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between E. coli and B. ovatus, during abscess formation.

TI  - Bacteriologic and pathologic studies of hepatic lesions in sheep.
AB  - At an abattoir, lesion specimens from 140 condemned sheep livers were collected for bacteriologic culture and for pathologic examination. Grossly, 23 lesions were abscesses; from 9 of which, Fusobacterium necrophorum biovar A (3 in pure culture and 6 in mixed culture) was isolated and from 14 of which, biovar B (6 in pure culture and 8 in mixed culture) was isolated. Escherichia coli was the predominant facultative anaerobic bacterium and Clostridium perfringens was the predominant obligate anaerobic bacterium isolated from the 14 lesions with mixed bacterial infection. Histologically, these lesions had a core of coagulation necrosis, encircled by a zone of necrotic phagocytic cells and bacteria with cellular characteristics of F necrophorum biovars A or B, and a connective tissue capsule. Of the 117 lesions without F necrophorum, 49 were culture-positive (for other organisms) and 69 were culture-negative. These 117 lesions were fibrous and were smaller than the 23 abscesses. A variety of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative anaerobic and obligate anaerobic bacteria was isolated from the culture-positive lesions, but always in low numbers. Eleven culture-negative and 18 culture-positive lesions were examined and had histologic characteristics of parasite-induced granulomas, with numerous eosinophils and epithelioid giant cells. Results of the study indicated that the histologic appearance of ovine hepatic lesions with F necrophorum was similar to bovine liver abscesses caused by F necrophorum, but unlike bovine liver abscesses, F necrophorum biovar B was isolated more frequently than was biovar A and often in pure culture. Most of the lesions in the condemned livers were parasite-induced granulomas.
TI  - Spontaneous bacterial empyema in cirrhotic patients: analysis of eleven cases.
AB  - Eleven episodes of spontaneous bacterial empyema were identified in eight cirrhotic patients with ascites. Criteria for spontaneous bacterial empyema included positive pleural fluid culture or polymorphonuclear cell concentration greater than 500 cells/mm3, evidence of pleural effusion before an infectious episode and transudate characteristics during infection. In five cases, spontaneous bacterial empyema was culture-negative and was associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ascitic fluid was culture-negative in two of these cases and culture-positive in three. Blood cultures were negative in all five of these cases. In six cases spontaneous bacterial empyema was culture-positive (Escherichia coli in four, Klebsiella pneumoniae in one and Clostridium perfringens in one). Four of these patients had the same organism in ascites; one had culture-negative spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and one had no infection of ascites. Blood cultures were positive in four of these patients; three died. Death was more frequent in patients with positive cultures than in those with negative ones (p less than 0.05). Patients with hydrothorax are prone to spontaneous bacterial empyema. This infection probably occurs through hematogenous seeding, but transfer of infected ascites from the abdominal cavity through the diaphragm cannot be excluded. Patients with spontaneous bacterial empyema may be asymptomatic or may be seen with fever, chills and dyspnea. Spontaneous bacterial empyema must be differentiated from parapneumonic empyemas. The presence of pleural effusion before the infectious episode, fluid characteristics and the organisms isolated are the clues for differential diagnosis. Treatment includes antibiotics; chest tube insertion probably is not necessary.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, expression, and site-directed mutagenesis of the gene from Clostridium perfringens encoding pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.
AB  - The DNA encoding pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase (HisDCase) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The gene encodes a single polypeptide of 320 amino acids, Mr 35,526, demonstrating that clostridial HisDCase, which has an (alpha beta)6 structure, is synthesized as a precursor (proHisDCase, pi 6). No pi subunits of proHisDCase were observed in crude or purified preparations of the cloned HisDCase; they appear to undergo rapid cleavage in vivo to the alpha (Mr 24,887) and beta (Mr 10,526) subunits characteristic of this HisDCase. This cleavage occurs between Ser-96 and Ser-97; Ser-97 gives rise to the catalytically essential pyruvoyl group blocking the N-termini of the alpha subunits of the active enzyme. When Ser-97 was converted to an alanyl residue by site-specific mutagenesis, the expressed, inactive protein (pi' 6) contained a single peptide species (pi', Mr 35,510) that was not cleaved either in vivo or in vitro. These results support previous conclusions that activation of the wild-type clostridial proenzyme occurs via nonhydrolytic serinolysis. Although clostridial HisDCase has only a 47% sequence similarity to HisDCase from Lactobacillus 30a, all of the residues known to be important for substrate binding and catalytic action of the Lactobacillus HisDCase are conserved in the C. perfringens enzyme. While the encoded N-terminal Met of clostridial HisDCase is removed by E. coli, the cloned enzyme retains a 10-residue presequence (NKNLEANRNR) not present in the mature enzyme isolated from C. perfringens.
TI  - [A case of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in a cow with endometritis and fetal death].
AB  - Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was diagnosed in a 3 1/2 year  old cow of the Simmental breed. The cow was little less than 6 months pregnant and was admitted to the clinic because of severely disturbed general health. The most important clinical findings were increased heart and breathing rate, rectal temperature of 39.9 degrees C, nosebleed and petechiae on the nasal mucosa. Additionally, the cow showed petechiae on the vaginal mucosa, haemorrhage from the rectum lasting several hours after rectal examination and severe haemoglobinuria. Haematological and biochemical examinations showed increased liver enzymes and severe changes in all coagulation parameters (platelet count, PT, PTT, thrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products). Based on the mentioned findings the diagnosis DIC was made. Possible causes were severe necrotic endometritis and placentitis combined with fetal death. High counts of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens were determined in liver, lung and abomasal contents of the aborted fetus as well as in the placenta. Uterine secretion contained Actinomyces pyogenes besides.
TI  - Plasmid transformation of Clostridium perfringens by electroporation methods.
AB  - Two electroporation methods were compared and modified to improve the frequencies of transfer of plasmid DNA into Clostridium perfringens. A plasmid shuttle vector, pSB92A2, containing chloramphenicol and ampicillin resistance genes and a clostridial origin of replication isolated from a cryptic C. perfringens plasmid, was constructed and successfully introduced into C. perfringens by both electrotransformation methods. Modifications which improved frequencies by 15-28 fold are described and may improve frequencies sufficiently for some vector/host combinations to consider the future use of more direct cloning strategies for the clostridia.
TI  - [Atypical osteogenesis following multiple sequestrectomies for infected open fracture of the femur: a case].
AB  - The authors present the case of an open fracture of femur Cauchoix type II with an infection due to Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus and Aspergillus fumigatus. After several sequestrectomies and five hyperbaric sessions, apyrexia was attained at the end of the third month, the femur having been stabilised with an external fixator. The 15 cm gap due to loss of bone substance, filled at each dressing with an antiseptic iodine based ointment, closed itself finishing as continuous bone five months after the accident, the granulation tissue having been recovered by thin skin grafts. A repeated fracture occurring forty-eight hours after the removal of the Hoffmann frame was treated by fitting an Ilizarov fixator arriving at consolidation in seven months. The authors examine different possibilities of accelerating osteogenesis and highlight the potential role of iodine ointment as inductive to osteogenesis stemming from a periosteal layer seemingly held in place.

TI  - Pore-forming toxins: experiments with S. aureus alpha-toxin, C. perfringens theta-toxin and E. coli haemolysin in lipid bilayers, liposomes and intact cells.
AB  - Three quite different bacterial toxins (S. aureus alpha-toxin, C. perfringens theta-toxin and E. coli haemolysin) induce the leakage of phosphorylated metabolites from Lettre cells and of calcein from liposomes; in each case leakage is inhibited by Zn2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Mg2+. Inhibition is not due to displacement of toxin from the membrane, since divalent cations inhibit leakage through pre-formed pores. Electrical conductivity across phospholipid bilayers is induced by each of the three toxins; in each case the probability of channels being in the open state is reduced by divalent cations. Although the pores induced in phospholipid bilayers and liposomes vary greatly in size (theta-toxin much greater than haemolysin greater than alpha-toxin), in Lettre cells the lesions appear more uniform, suggestive of a limiting effect in cells.
TI  - Comparison of bacteriologic culture of blood and necropsy specimens for determining the cause of foal septicemia: 47 cases (1978-1987)
AB  - Diagnosis of bacterial septicemia was confirmed by results of bacteriologic culture of antemortem blood samples and/or necropsy specimens obtained from 47 foals up to 8 days old. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from all 47 foals, and mixed infections with more than one organism were involved in 26 (55%). Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus spp, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent isolates, infecting 55, 34, and 23% of foals, respectively. Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic bacteria were isolated only from foals with mixed infections with gram-negative organisms. Clostridium perfringens was the only anaerobe isolated. In 38 (81%) of 47 foals with confirmed septicemia, blood samples were culture-positive. Thirty-two septicemic foals subsequently died, allowing a comparison to be made between the species of bacteria isolated by culture of blood with those recovered by culture of internal organs at necropsy. Blood failed to yield any gram-negative organisms in 12 (37.5%) of 32 foals from which a gram-negative pathogen was isolated at necropsy. Forty-three percent of the gram-negative bacteria, including 59% of the E coli, and 10% of the gram-positive bacteria found in septicemic foals at necropsy were not detected earlier by results of bacteriologic culture of blood.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of isoascorbic acid combined with mild heat.
AB  - The thermal inactivation of Salmonella thompson, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Candida zeylanoides, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis was accelerated by the addition of sodium isoascorbate (1 mmol/l) to phosphate-buffer heating medium but not to complex food mixtures. The lethal effect of isoascorbate was nullified by heating under anaerobic conditions or by the addition of catalase. The scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, mannitol and formate were not protective whereas histidine was. Histidine may have protected by slowing the rate of isoascorbate autoxidation, a property common to other amino acids tested. Superoxide dismutase was not protective. Dehydroascorbic acid also enhanced heat killing and its action was also reversed by catalase. The bactericidal effects of mild heat plus isoascorbate or dehydroascorbic acid both apparently depend on oxidative processes but their relative effectiveness was not related to their respective rates of oxygen consumption or peroxide production. We speculate that site-specific redox reactions, involving amino-carbonyl intermediates are involved in the inactivation mechanism.
TI  - The survival patterns of selected faecal bacteria in tropical fresh waters.
AB  - The survival of various faecal bacteria used as indicators of the faecal contamination of water supplies has been investigated in a tropical environment (Sierra Leone). Isolates representing the thermotolerant coliform (TtC) and faecal streptococcus (FS) groups, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were studied over a 48 h period of immersion in water from three different sources. Survival patterns varied according to source type, but some general observations were made: a portion of the TtC group was apparently capable of substantial regrowth; FS organisms died off at a faster rate than TtC organisms initially, but survived longer; vegetative cells of C. perfringens died off rapidly; and Salmonella spp. could survive for as long as the other faecal organisms tested. The implications of results for the analysis of tropical waters for faecal contamination are discussed.
TI  - Comparative study of visual inspections and microbiological sampling in premises  manufacturing and selling high-risk foods.
AB  - The possible relationship between the results of a microbiological sampling programme and visual inspections carried out in local food-manufacturing premises was examined. Using five main parameters - overall appearance, personal hygiene, risk of contamination, temperature control, and training and education - a visual inspection rating score was established for each of the premises. A variety of high-risk processed foods, and specimens from hands, wiping cloths and environmental swabs were examined. The results from two study periods indicated that there was an overall poor agreement between microbiological results and inspection ratings. On its own, neither sampling nor visual assessment reliably monitored the performance of the premises. A combined approach, using selective microbiological examination to support a system of standardized inspections, is suggested for monitoring food hygiene standards in premises selling high-risk foods.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the 3' half of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin gene  and demonstration that this region encodes receptor-binding activity.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens type A enterotoxin (CPE) causes the symptoms associated with C. perfringens food poisoning. To determine whether the C-terminal half of CPE contains receptor-binding activity, the 3' half of the cpe structural gene was cloned with an Escherichia coli expression vector system. E. coli lysates containing the expressed C-terminal CPE fragment (CPEfrag) were then assayed for CPE-like serologic, receptor-binding, and cytotoxic activities. CPEfrag was shown to contain an epitope located at or near the receptor-binding domain of the CPE molecule. Competitive-binding studies showed specific competition for CPE receptors between CPE and CPEfrag lysates. CPEfrag lysates did not cause cytotoxicity in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells. However, preincubation with CPEfrag lysates specifically protected Vero cells from subsequent CPE challenge. This indicates that CPEfrag recognizes the physiologic receptor which mediates CPE cytotoxicity. Collectively, these studies indicate that the C-terminal half of CPE contains a receptor-binding domain but additional amino acid sequences appear to be required for CPE cytotoxicity.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of a sialidase gene from Clostridium sordellii G12.
AB  - A 4.3 kb XbaI restriction fragment of DNA from Clostridium sordellii G12 hybridized with a synthetic oligonucleotide representing the N-terminus of the sialidase protein secreted by C. sordellii. This cloned fragment was shown to encode only part of the sialidase protein. The sialidase gene of C. sordellii was completed by a 0.7 kb RsaI restriction fragment overlapping one end of the XbaI fragment. After combining the two fragments and transformation of Escherichia coli, a clone that expressed sialidase was obtained. The nucleotide sequence of the sialidase gene of C. sordellii G12 was determined. The sequence of the 18 N-terminal amino acids of the purified extracellular enzyme perfectly matched the predicted amino acid sequence near the beginning of the structural gene. The amino acid sequence derived from the complete gene corresponds to a protein with a molecular mass of 44,735 Da. Upstream from the putative ATG initiation codon, ribosomal-binding site and promoter-like consensus sequences were found. The encoded protein has a leader sequence of 27 amino acids. The enzyme expressed in E. coli has similar properties to the enzyme isolated from C. sordellii, except for small differences in size and isoelectric point. Significant homology (70%) was found with a sialidase gene from C. perfringens.
TI  - Standardisation of quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early detection of bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early diagnosis of bacteraemias. Small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. Bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. Blood cultures inoculated with Clostridium perfringens and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. Blood cultures with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group A) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic acids. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. Blood cultures inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within 24 to 48 h of incubation. Since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.
TI  - [The incidence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus and Clostridium perfringens from cases of diarrhea in children, in the region of Campinas, SP, Brazil].
AB  - A survey for the detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus  and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in diarrheic stools of children up to 2 years old was carried out in the region of Campinas, SP, Brazil. Twenty-seven (20.45%) faecal specimens were positive for ETEC. From these samples 41 strains of ETEC were isolated from which 40 produced only thermolabile (LT) enterotoxin, as detected by a modified radial immune haemolysis test. Among the 183 faecal specimens examined for the detection of rotavirus, 29 (15.84%) were positive when examined by polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoenzymatic assay (EIA) being 15 (51.7%), derived from stools collected from winter months. All strains of rotavirus belonged to group A and through the PAGE technique, it was observed that the most frequent (9 strains) electrophoretype, according to the adopted classification, was Ib, IIc, IIIb, IVa. Only 113 fecal specimens were examined for the presence of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens. For the detection of enterotoxin in culture supernatants the reverse passive haemagglutination and intravenous inoculation of mice were used. Twelve (10.61%) enterotoxigenic C. perfringens strains were found. Taking into consideration these findings the authors call the attention of the relative value of conventional coprocultures for diagnostic purposes, pointing out the important of establishing simplified methods which would render easier, the detection and identification of the groups of enteropathogenic agents studied in this research.
TI  - Gene cloning shows the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens to contain both sphingomyelinase and lecithinase activities.
AB  - The plc gene encoding the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C), an important virulence factor of Clostridium perfringens, has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. Transcriptional analysis of mRNAs produced in vivo by C. perfringens and E. coli, and in vitro using purified RNA polymerase from C. perfringens revealed that plc is transcribed constitutively from a single promoter situated about 100 nucleotides from the coding sequence. A T7 expression system was used to overproduce alpha-toxin in E. coli; enzymological studies with the amplified plc gene product unambiguously demonstrated that both lecithinase (phospholipase C) and sphingomyelinase activities were associated with this 43,000 dalton cytotoxin. The 370-residue alpha-toxin is haemolytic and shares sequence and functional homology with the two components of Bacillus cereus haemolysin, cereolysin AB, in which phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase activities are associated with different polypeptides.
TI  - Electroporation-mediated transformation of lysostaphin-treated Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A reliable and efficient method has been developed for the electroporation-mediated transformation of Clostridium perfringens with plasmid DNA. Transformation of vegetative cells of C. perfringens strain 13 with the 7.9-kb Escherichia coli-C. perfringens shuttle plasmid pHR 106 required pretreatment with lysostaphin (2 to 20 micrograms/ml) for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Cells harvested early in the logarithmic stage of growth were transformed more efficiently than cells at other growth phases. The transformation frequency increased with the DNA concentration, to a saturating level at 5 to 10 micrograms DNA/ml. The transformation frequency was proportional to the field strength and time constant of the electroporation pulse; however, the field strength was a far more important parameter. A cell density between 1 x 10(8) and 5 x 10(8) cells/ml proved to be optimal for transformation. The procedure was capable of generating up to 3.0 x 10(5) transformants per micrograms DNA. The potential value of the method for the cloning of C. perfringens genes was demonstrated by the cloning of the clostridial tetracycline-resistance determinant, tetP, from the E. coli recombinant plasmid pJIR71, into C. perfringens strain 13.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - Hybridization analysis of three chloramphenicol resistance determinants from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance determinant from a nonconjugative strain of Clostridium perfringens was cloned and shown to be expressed in Escherichia coli. Subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, catQ, to within a 1.25-kilobase (kb) partial Sau3A fragment. The catQ gene contained internal HindII, HaeIII, and DraI restriction sites and was distinct from the catP gene, which was originally cloned (L. J. Abraham, A. J. Wales, and J. I. Rood Plasmid 14:37-46, 1985) from the conjugative C. perfringens R plasmid, pIP401. Hybridization studies were carried out with a 0.35-kb DraI-P fragment of pJIR260 as an internal catQ-specific probe and a 0.38-kb EcoRV-HinfI fragment of pJIR62 as an internal catP-specific gene probe. The results showed that the catP and catQ genes were not similar and that neither probe hybridized with cat genes from other bacterial genera. However, the catP gene was similar to the cloned catD gene from Clostridium difficile. Comparative studies with both catP and catD probes showed that these genes had significant restriction identity. We therefore suggest that these genes were derived from a common source.
TI  - Vero cell assay for rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin.
AB  - A rapid assay which measured the biological activity of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin was developed. The method involved the rapid killing of Vero cells by enterotoxin produced by C. perfringens grown in Duncan and Strong sporulation medium. Serial dilutions of toxin were added to Vero cells either in suspension or grown as monolayers in wells of a 96-well cell tissue culture cluster plate. Vital staining of Vero cells with neutral red, followed by extraction of the dye, allowed toxin levels to be determined either visually or by optical density measurements with a micro-ELISA M580 computer program. The toxin produced was confirmed as different from the Vero toxin of Escherichia coli and the alpha and theta toxins of C. perfringens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - Cloning and hybridization analysis of ermP, a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance determinant from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The erythromycin resistance determinant from Clostridium perfringens CP592 was cloned and shown to be expressed in Escherichia coli. The resultant plasmid, pJIR122 (7.9 kilobase pairs [kb]), was unstable since in both recA+ and recA E. coli hosts spontaneous deletion of 2.7 kb, including the erythromycin resistance determinant, was observed. Subcloning, as well as deletion analysis with BAL 31, localized the erythromycin resistance gene (ermP) to within a 1.0-kb region of pJIR122. A 0.5-kb fragment internal to ermP was 32P labeled and used as an ermP-specific probe in DNA hybridization experiments which used target DNA prepared from representatives of each of the known erm classes and also from erythromycin-resistant isolates of a variety of clostridial species. Hybridizing sequences were detected in DNA from several Clostridium difficile isolates and a Clostridium paraputrificum strain; however, ermP was not widespread in erythromycin-resistant C. perfringens isolates. The ermP determinant hybridized to, and shared significant restriction identity with, the ermB class gene from the streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1. No hybridization was detected with the other six hybridization classes of erm determinants.
TI  - Bacteria and gallstone nucleation.
AB  - This preliminary study reports for the first time that there might be a possible  association between bacteria and the aetiology of some cholesterol calculi. The gall-bladder biles from 225 cholecystectomy patients underwent bacteriological and microscopic study. Cholesterol calculi from 13 patients (10.2%) were observed to be associated with gall-bladder bile profusely infected with at least one bacterial species that was shown to possess beta-glucuronidase activity, an enzyme that is thought to promote calcium bilirubinate precipitation in bile. Concomitantly, the associated gall-bladder bile was 'high' in calcium bilirubinate precipitation and the precipitate was also detected in the centre of the gallstones. Moreover, in approximately half of these patients (six of 13), the cholesterol gallstones' nuclear areas also contained calcium palmitate, which is also thought to be due to bacterial activity. The results also support the hypothesis that bacteria with active beta-glucuronidase (for example, Escherichia coli) can significantly influence the aetiology of brown pigment gallstones. In contrast, bacteria were observed to have no role in black pigment gallstone formation, as their associated gall-bladder biles were always observed to be sterile.
TI  - Pathogenicity of enterococci in a rat model of fecal peritonitis.
AB  - The pathogenicity of enterococci in intraabdominal sepsis has not been clarified. Therefore, fecal-type peritonitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of barium sulfate along with a bacterial inoculum consisting of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens with or without Streptococcus faecalis. Mortality at 19 d and characteristics of intraabdominal abscesses in survivors at 19 d were analyzed. The presence of S. faecalis in the original inoculum was significantly associated with death or large (greater than 20 mm) abscess formation when these two end points were examined together. S. faecalis may synergize with other bacteria in intraabdominal sepsis to augment morbidity and possibly mortality.
TI  - Foodborne gastroenteritis due to Norwalk virus in a Winnipeg hotel.
AB  - Within 1 week four separate incidents of gastroenteritis presumed to be foodborne were reported by guests of a Winnipeg hotel. Investigation revealed poor food-handling practices and illness among the kitchen staff. Elevated bacterial counts and Escherichia coli were found in 15 of 24 samples of food tested, and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 2 pastry samples. Culture of 14 stool samples for bacteria yielded Clostridium perfringens in 1 sample from a staff member and coagulase-positive S. aureus in 2 samples from staff members and 3 from guests. All of the S. aureus isolates were nonenterotoxigenic and had three different phage patterns. Electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy revealed the prototype Norwalk virus in five (56%) of nine stool samples; four samples were from guests, and one was from a kitchen employee. The employee had had diarrhea 24 hours before the first outbreak and was thus believed to be the source of the virus infection, possibly through food handling. This is the first report of Norwalk virus isolation and the first of foodborne Norwalk virus transmission in Canada. A review of foodborne Norwalk virus infections is presented.
TI  - The antibody response of normal mice to immunization with single-stranded DNA of  various species origin.
AB  - To further assess the mechanism for the induction of anti-DNA antibodies, the response of BALB/c mice to immunization with single-stranded DNA of various species origin was determined. Anti-DNA levels of mice immunized with Escherichia coli DNA as complexes with methylated BSA in adjuvant were significantly greater by ELISA than those from mice immunized similarly with calf thymus DNA. Furthermore, comparison of the responses of mice immunized with complexes of DNA from calf thymus, chicken blood, Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, human placenta, or salmon testes indicated that the bacterial DNAs induced the highest antibody levels. The antibody response to E. coli DNA was shown by inhibition ELISA to have two populations, one binding unique determinants in E. coli DNA and the other cross-reactive with determinants expressed on all DNAs tested. These results indicate that DNA molecules, when complexed to a protein carrier, differ in their immunogenic potential, likely because of the presence of unique sequences or structures rarely presented by mammalian host DNA.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - [The "diseased" or "dead" guillemots (Uria aalge), three-toed gulls (Rissa tridactyla), silver gulls (Larus argentatus) and laughing gulls (Larus ridibundus) found in the area of the German Bay, 1982-1985].
AB  - Between 1982 and 1985 the cadavers of 50 Guillemots (Uria aalge), 41 Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), 26 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and 34 Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus) were examined pathological, bacteriological and virological. The probable cause of death was established. Parasitosis were particularly prevalent in Herring Gulls (49%), where the main infection--as in Black-headed Gulls--was with Cestoides. In Kittiwakes and Guillemots mainly Spiruroideae were recorded. The commonest bacterium isolated in organs and intestinal tract was Escherichia coli, followed by Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridium perfringens. Salmonella were found in the organs of 5% and in the intestinal tract of 3% of the birds. The species of Salmonella most frequently isolated was Salmonella typhimurium varieties copenhagen. Also recorded were Yersinia intermedia Serovar 0:17 (1x), Pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria of the Haemophilus-Pasteurella-Actinobacillus group (1x), Pasteurella multocida (2x), Moraxella septicaemiae (1x), Campylobacter spec. (1x), Mycoplasma spec. (6x), DNase positive Staphylococcus spec. (4x) and Streptococcus spec. (6x). Less in evidence among the birds examined were fungus diseases with Aspergillus spec. (4x) and Blastomyces spec. (4x). As for viruses one Guillemot was found to have an Adenovirus and another one to have a Paramyxovirus. From one of the Herring Gulls there also was isolated a Paramyxovirus, from a second one to a Reovirus. Three other species isolated have get to be identified. The chief cause of sickness and death in the Guillemots was oil-contamination. The majority of the examined Kittiwakes and Herring Gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. Many of the Black-headed Gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. In order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. Without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.
TI  - [The occurrence of Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal flora of gray herons (Ardea cinerea)].
AB  - The flora of the large intestine of 92 grey herons was examined for the frequency of aerobic and microaerobic growing bacteria. Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides and E. coli were isolated from 55%, 48%, 14% and 35% of the birds, respectively. It could be demonstrated that the findings of these bacteria in the intestinal flora are depending on the age of the birds. The percentage of carriers of Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas hydrophila and Plesiomonas shigelloides was highest in nestlings younger than 18 days, less high in older nestlings and lowest in adult grey herons. Contrary to those bacteria, E. coli was found more often in the intestinal flora at increasing age of the birds. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 6 birds. Two birds yielded positive for Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter spp., respectively. Other aerobic and microaerobic bacteria play a less significant role as part of the intestinal flora.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a phospholipase C gene of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The gene encoding phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into lambda gt10. The maximal size of the coding region was 1.4 kb and the minimum was 1.1 kb as determined by subcloning into the vector pBR322 and testing for activity. The nucleotide sequence of this region contained a single open reading frame of 1194 bp corresponding to a protein of Mr 45473 with a possible N-terminal signal sequence of 28 amino acids which when removed, would give a mature protein of Mr 42521. This is in good agreement with the reported size of 43 kDa. The coding region has a dG + dC content of 33.7%, and the codon usage displays a pronounced preference for codons with the lowest dG + dC content.
TI  - Cloning in Escherichia coli of the enterotoxin gene from Clostridium perfringens  type A.
AB  - A 26 bp DNA probe has been constructed with minimal degeneracy to the protein sequence for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin. The probe has been hybridized against a 6-10 kb chromosomal bank from C. perfringens 8239, prepared as a HindIII partial digest in pHG165. From this survey a clone has been identified containing a 6.8 kb DNA insert with strong hybridization to the probe. Direct plasmid sequencing has identified a translational reading frame within this clone which correlates with the known protein sequence for the type A enterotoxin. DNA sequences 5' to this open reading frame and containing the putative transcriptional control regions show areas of significant homology with regions upstream from the ATG codon of the tetanus toxin gene.
TI  - Bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum of ICR mice and Wistar rats orally administered with a single lethal dose of fusarenon-X, a trichothecene mycotoxin.
AB  - A single oral dose of fusarenon-X (F-X), a trichothecene mycotoxin, resulted in abnormal microflora in the jejunum in ICR mice and Wistar rats with some differences in dose response between the species. In the acute phase, enterobacteria, streptococci, Clostridium perfringens and bacteroides showed remarkably increased counts in the jejunum of mice and rats dosed with F-X while lactobacilli showed a decrease in count. F-X brought an invasion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into the livers, lungs, kidneys and spleens of ICR mice. Changes in the jejunal microflora appeared after 7 h in ICR mice and after 24 h in Wistar rats after a single oral dose of F-X of 7.5 and 4.0 mg/kg b.w., respectively, and the microflora returned to its normal state at 72 h in mice and 96 h in rats. The changes of intestinal microflora were followed by alterations in the growth curves of both animal species. The pH in the glandular stomach was also greatly enhanced before changes in the jejunal microflora. Acute F-X intoxication may be an involved manifestation of essential cytotoxicity of F-X mycotoxin alone and secondary bacterial overgrowth in the bowel.
TI  - Phospholipase C and haemolytic activities of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  cloned in Escherichia coli: sequence and homology with a Bacillus cereus phospholipase C.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) gene (cpa) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The biological activities of the cloned gene product have been analysed and the complete nucleotide sequence of the cpa gene has been determined. The cloned cpa gene product, which is exported to the periplasm in E. coli, possesses both phospholipase C and haemolytic activities. Haemolysis is not apparent when cell extracts are incubated with isotonic suspensions of sheep erythrocytes, but can be detected and quantified readily when dilutions of the same extracts are placed in wells in sheep-blood agar plates. Like other sequenced clostridial genes, the cpa gene has a high AT content (66.4%), exhibits a strong bias for using codons with A or T in the wobble position, and the 350 base pairs upstream from the gene have a significantly higher AT content (79.5%) than the coding region. The cpa gene encodes a 398 amino acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular weight of 45,481 D. This is very similar to the estimated molecular weight (Mr) of the cpa primary gene product expressed in an in vitro transcription-translation system (Mr 46,000), but larger than the cpa gene product detected in E. coli minicells, E. coli whole cells or in C. perfringens cells (Mr 43,000), suggesting post-translational processing. The 28 N-terminal residues of the deduced alpha-toxin sequence possess the consensus features of a signal peptide and may be removed during secretion. The deduced alpha-toxin sequence shares significant structural homology with the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and expression studies of a chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase-coding gene from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a CmR determinant, located on the Clostridium perfringens plasmid pIP401, was determined and its gene product was identified as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The cat structural gene is preceded by transcription-initiation signals characteristic for Escherichia coli sigma 70 or Bacillus subtilis sigma 43 promoters. By promoter probing in the heterologous hosts the direction of transcription of the clostridial cat gene was analysed and the cat mRNA start point was determined in vitro using the RNA polymerases of E. coli and B. subtilis. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of C. perfringens CAT and other CAT proteins of Gram-positive and Gram-negative origin shows a remarkable degree of homology between the various enzymes.
TI  - Microbiological and compositional status of Turkish white cheese.
AB  - Results of the chemical and microbiological examination of 38 Turkish white cheese samples are presented. On average, the cheese was characterized by a high moisture and salt content, 58.18 and 3.56%, respectively, and a pH of 4.68. Significant variation was found in these compositional factors, indicating the extreme diversity of manufacturing practices. Microbiological analysis revealed the presence of high numbers of coliforms, faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli, extremely high numbers of faecal streptococci, and a low level and incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens were not isolated from the samples. There was no correlation between the levels of coliforms, faecal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci, suggesting that the enterococci count in Turkish white cheese may not be a good indicator of sanitary practices.
TI  - Determination of the A-T content of DNA by second-derivative ultraviolet spectroscopy.
AB  - A method for the determination of the A-T content of DNA based on second-derivative ultraviolet spectra is presented. It allows measurement in a wide range of pH values, ionic strengths, and buffer media. It is nondestructive for the sample and requires not more than 10 micrograms of DNA.
TI  - Construction of an Escherichia coli-Clostridium perfringens shuttle vector and plasmid transformation of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A stable shuttle vector which replicates in Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens was constructed by ligating a 3.6-kilobase (kb) fragment of plasmid pBR322 with C. perfringens plasmid pHB101 (3.1 kb). The marker for this shuttle plasmid originated from the 1.3-kb chloramphenicol resistance gene of plasmid pHR106. The resulting shuttle vector, designated pAK201, is 8 kb in size and codes for resistance to 20 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml in both E. coli and C. perfringens. Following shuttle vector construction in E. coli, plasmid pAK201 was transformed into E. coli HB101 and C. perfringens ATCC 3624A, using intact cell electroporation. The transformation frequencies were 10(6) and 10(4) transformants per microgram of DNA in E. coli and C. perfringens, respectively. Restriction enzyme analysis of the chimera isolated from transformants of both microorganisms suggested that the plasmids were identical. Reciprocal transformation experiments in E. coli and C. perfringens indicated no difference in transformation frequency. Plasmid pAK201 was stable in C. perfringens following repeated transfer in the absence of chloramphenicol pressure. The restriction map of plasmid pAK201 shows six unique cut sites which should be useful for future genetic analysis and C. perfringens gene library construction.
TI  - Population of Salmonella typhimurium in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - To test the interaction of various species of bacteria with Salmonella typhimurium, levels of S. typhimurium were measured in the cecum of gnotobiotic chickens inoculated with various test bacteria and subsequently with S. typhimurium. The population of S. typhimurium was suppressed in the cecum of chickens previously inoculated with Escherichia coli. Populations of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, or Lactobacillus acidophilus were transiently, though not significantly, suppressed by S. typhimurium. Inoculation of chickens with C. perfringens caused a terminal increase in the population of S. typhimurium. Thus the effect of cecal contents on reducing the levels of S. typhimurium in the cecum may be due to the presence of E. coli in the cecal contents.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the phospholipase C gene from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium bifermentans.
AB  - The phospholipase C gene from Clostridium perfringens was isolated, and its sequence was determined. It was found that the structural gene codes for a protein of 399 amino acid residues. The NH2-terminal residues have the typical features of a signal peptide and are probably cleaved after secretion. Escherichia coli cells harboring the phospholipase C gene-containing plasmid expressed high levels of this protein in the periplasmic space. Phospholipase C purified from E. coli transformants was enzymatically active, hemolytic to erythrocytes, and toxic to animals when injected intravenously. The phospholipase C gene from a related organism, Clostridium bifermentans, was also isolated. The two phospholipase C genes were found to be 64% homologous in coding sequence. The C. bifermentans protein, however, was 50-fold less active enzymatically than the C. perfringens enzyme.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A fragment of DNA containing the gene coding for the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. By comparison of the gene sequence with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. The gene promoter showed considerable homology with the E. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene was expressed by E. coli. The cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. A 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the N terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase C and weaker homology with the phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of precooked, vacuum-packaged uncured beef and pork.
AB  - Microbiological examination of 29 packages of precooked, vacuum-packaged beef and pork products purchased at local and regional supermarkets along with 110 packages of precooked, vacuum-packaged, sliced roast beef obtained from a major meat processor did not disclose the presence of Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella. The effects of storage temperature and length of storage on the microflora of 110 packages of sliced roast beef were determined at specific intervals of storage up to 84 days at 1 degrees and 5 degrees C, and up to 28 days at 10 degrees C. The microflora of samples stored at 1 degrees and 5 degrees C was dominated by Lactobacillus spp. when examined on day 28 and throughout the remainder of the 84-day test period. The microflora of samples held at 10 degrees C was dominated by Lactobacillus spp. until late in storage when Hafnia alvei became a major portion of the bacterial population. Precooked, sliced roast beef had a longer shelf life in laboratory controlled evaluations when stored at 1 degrees C as opposed to 5 degrees or 10 degrees C.
TI  - Effect of rice fiber on human fecal microflora.
AB  - The effects of brown rice, containing fourfold as much dietary fiber as polished  rice, on the human fecal microflora were determined. Significantly increased numbers of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Enterococcus faecalis were observed during the brown rice intake, whereas the total counts and the numbers of bacteroides, Eubacterium aerofaciens, and Escherichia coli during the intake were lower than those before and after the intake. Lower numbers of clostridia and low incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum and C. perfringens were observed during the brown rice intake.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of clove oil dispersed in a concentrated sugar solution.
AB  - Essential oil of clove, dispersed (0.4% v/v) in a concentrated sugar solution, had a marked germicidal effect against various bacteria and Candida albicans. Staphylococcus aureus (five strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli inoculated at a level of 10(7) cfu/ml, and C. albicans (inoculum 4.0 x 10(5) cfu/ml) were killed (greater than 99.999%) after 2-7 min in a laboratory broth supplemented with 63% (v/w) of sugar, and containing 0.4% (v/w) of essential oil of clove. Added organic matter (i.e. human or bovine serum) did not impair its antimicrobial activity. Sugar was not necessary for the antimicrobial activity of clove oil, but the concentrated sugar solution provided a good vehicle for obtaining an oil dispersion that is relatively stable for certain practical applications.
TI  - High resolution deuterium NMR studies of bacterial metabolism.
AB  - High resolution deuterium NMR spectra were obtained from suspensions of five bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Deuterium-labeled D-glucose at C-1, C-2, and C-6 was used to monitor dynamically anaerobic metabolism. The flux of glucose through the various bacterial metabolic pathways could be determined by following the disappearance of glucose and the appearance of the major end products in the 2H NMR spectrum. The presence of both labeled and unlabeled metabolites could be detected using 1H NMR spectroscopy since the proton resonances in the labeled species are shifted upfield due to an isotopic chemical shift effect. The 1H-1H scalar coupling observed in both the 2H and 1H NMR spectra was used to assign definitively the resonances of labeled species. An increase in the intensity of natural abundance deuterium signal of water can be used to monitor pathways in which a deuteron is lost from the labeled metabolite. The steps in which label loss can occur are outlined, and the influence these processes have on the ability of 2H NMR spectroscopy to monitor metabolism are assessed.
TI  - Some factors affecting isolation of Clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  - Clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (CI)]: Human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog, 2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). Quantification of C. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. Contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., C. perfringens and Streptococcus sp., Group G, inhibited isolation of C. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the perfringolysin O (theta-toxin)  gene from Clostridium perfringens and characterization of the gene product.
AB  - The gene encoding perfringolysin O, the thiol-activated hemolysin from Clostridium perfringens (ATCC 13124), was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A gene library of C. perfringens chromosomal DNA was constructed in bacteriophage lambda EMBL3. A recombinant was identified that produced a hemolysin that was inhibited by cholesterol and was tentatively identified as perfringolysin O. Subcloning experiments localized the perfringolysin O gene (pfo) to a 1.8-kilobase region on the cloned chromosomal fragment. E. coli which carried a plasmid subclone of pfo (pRT1B) expressed perfringolysin O and secreted it into the periplasm. The amino-terminal sequence of the pfo gene product was identical with that determined for perfringolysin O purified from C. perfringens, indicating that E. coli correctly removed the signal peptide during secretion. Purification of the pfo product was accomplished by high-resolution gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography. Analysis of the pfo product by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis showed that it comigrated with authentic perfringolysin O; both had an estimated molecular weight of 54,000. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of the pfo product and of authentic perfringolysin O purified from C. perfringens were identical. The hemolytic activity of the pfo product was similar to that of authentic perfringolysin O; one hemolytic unit (HU) of the cloned gene product or authentic perfringolysin O corresponded to approximately 1 ng or a hemolytic activity of 10(6) HU per mg.

TI  - The penetration of fleroxacin into intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  - Using a recently developed, low mortality model of an intra-abdominal abscess in  the Wistar rat, we have studied the penetration of fleroxacin into the abscess. Maximum serum concentration was 1.83 +/- 0.39 mg l and occurred 1 h after iv injection (20 mg/kg), but even at 4 h after administration the mean serum level was 1.21 +/- 0.27 mg/l. By contrast, levels in pus were 6.27 +/- 0.83 mg/l at 1 h rising steadily to a value of 12.7 +/- 3.69 mg/l at 4 h. The study has confirmed exceptional antibiotic penetration into the abscess, with levels at all time intervals between 0.5 and 8 h after administration in excess of the MIC50 for Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a Clostridium perfringens sialidase gene.
AB  - Escherichia coli was transformed with pUC vectors containing Sau3A restriction fragments (RF) of Clostridium perfringens DNA. Two clones expressed sialidase activity when assayed with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid. A synthetic oligonucleotide representing the N-terminus of the expressed enzyme hybridized with the clostridial insert and with a corresponding 2.1 kb Sau3A RF of the C. perfringens genome. The insert reduced to 1.4 kb, which still encoded active sialidase, has been sequenced. The structural gene encodes 382 amino acids representing an Mr of 42770. A hydrophobic leader sequence is absent. Upstream from the initiation codon ATG, a GA-rich region is found and considered as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Homology with the N-terminus of the Vibrio cholerae sialidase gene and with viral sialidase sequences was not found.
TI  - Lyophilized Clostridium perfringens 3 alpha- and Clostridium bifermentans 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases: two new stable enzyme preparations for routine bile acid analysis.
AB  - Preparations of 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.50) from Clostridium perfringens were successfully lyophilized into a stable powder form. Purification of the enzyme was achieved using triazine dye affinity chromatography. C. perfringens 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was purified 24-fold using Reactive Red 120 (Procion Red) -cross-linked agarose (70% yield). Quantitative measurement of bile acids with the purified enzymes, 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.159) from Clostridium bifermentans (strain F-6), was achieved spectrophotometrically. Standard curves with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) and cholic acid were linear within a concentration range of 20-100 microM. Analysis of mixtures of ursodeoxycholic acid and CDC showed the additive nature of the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and showed also that 7 alpha-hydroxyl groups were independently quantified by the 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Bile acids in Folch extracts of human bile samples were measured using purified preparations of Pseudomonas testosteroni 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, C. perfringens 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, Escherichia coli 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and C. bifermentans (strain F-6) 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Statistical comparison validated the use of C. perfringens 3 alpha- and C. bifermentans 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases for the quantification of bile acids in bile.
TI  - Studies of UV-inducible promoters from Clostridium perfringens in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - Expression of a 4 kb segment of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid, pIP404, from Clostridium perfringens is inducible by UV-irradiation. DNA sequence analysis revealed that this region contains three genes: uviA, uviB and bcn encoding the bacteriocin BCN5. Biochemical studies with mRNAs showed that expression was controlled at the transcriptional level and that the genes were organized in two independent transcriptional units, uviAB and bcn, both directed by tandem promoters inducible by UV light. The bcn gene is transcribed from three promoters (P1, P2, P3) while transcription of uviAB is directed by two promoters (P4, P5). With the exception of P4, which bears some resemblance to the consensus eubacterial promoter sequence, none of these promoters was recognized in vitro by the major forms of RNA polymerase from C. perfringens, Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. Promoters P1, P3 and P5, which show striking homology with each other, contain unusual sequences in the '-35' and '-10' regions known to be recognized by RNA polymerase and this might indicate positive control.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. Therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. High metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. The same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.
TI  - Construction of shuttle cloning vectors for Bacteroides fragilis and use in assaying foreign tetracycline resistance gene expression.
AB  - Shuttle vectors capable of replication in both Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis have been developed. Conjugal transfer of these plasmids from E. coli to B. fragilis is facilitated by inclusion of the origin of transfer of the IncP plasmid RK2. The vectors pDK1 and pDK2 provide unique sites for cloning selectable markers in Bacteroides. pOA10 is a cosmid vector containing the replication region of pCP1 necessary for maintenance in Bacteroides. pDK3, pDK4.1, and pDK4.2 contain the Bacteroides clindamycin resistance gene allowing selection and maintenance in B. fragilis of plasmids containing inserted DNA fragments. pDK3 was used to test the expression in B. fragilis of five foreign tetracycline resistance (TcR) genes. The tetA, -B, and -C markers from facultative gram-negative bacteria, as well as a TcR determinant from Clostridium perfringens, did not express TcR in B. fragilis. The tetM gene, originally described in streptococci, encoded a small but reproducible increase of TcR in Bacteroides. These studies demonstrate the utility of shuttle vectors for introducing cloned genes into Bacteroides and underscore the differences in gene expression in these anaerobes.
TI  - Inhibition of N-acetylneuraminate lyase by N-acetyl-4-oxo-D-neuraminic acid.
AB  - We show that the 4-oxo analogue of N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid strongly inhibits N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NeuAc aldolase, EC 4.1.3.3) from Clostridum perfringens (Ki = 0.025 mM) and Escherichia coli (Ki = 0.15 mM). In each case the inhibition was competitive. N-Acetyl-D-neuraminic acid; N-Acetylneuraminate lyase; N-Acetyl-D-neuraminic acid analog; 5-Acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-beta-D-manno-non-2,4-diulosonic acid; 2-Deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetyl-4-oxo-neuraminic acid; Competitive inhibitor.
TI  - The Clostridium perfringens chloramphenicol resistance transposon Tn4451 excises  precisely in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Tn4451-deletion derivatives, pJIR47 and pJIR86, which were derived from Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, respectively, showed that the deletion events that led to the formation of these plasmids were identical and precise. The results also showed that the termini of this C. perfringens-derived transposon contained imperfect 12-bp inverted repeat sequences which had some sequence similarity with the termini of Tn3-like transposons.
TI  - Identification and molecular genetic analysis of replication functions of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid pIP404 from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The replication functions of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid pIP404, from Clostridium perfringens, were localized to a 2.8-kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment by cloning into a vector deficient for replication in Bacillus subtilis. This fragment contains two genes, cop and rep, which encode proteins and an 800-bp noncoding segment of complex structure consisting of multiple tandemly repeated sequences. The Cop protein is involved in copy number control, whereas the rep gene product is essential for plasmid replication. By deletion analysis the minimal origin of replication was defined as the rep gene plus most of the repeated sequences. A powerful promoter producing a 150-nucleotide RNA molecule, RNA1, that could act as an anti-sense RNA to the rep gene was detected in the "origin-like" region. In contrast to most other small plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pIP404, and its derivatives, does not appear to replicate via a single stranded intermediate in either C. perfringens or B. subtilis.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence and genetic organization of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid, pIP404, from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid, pIP404, from Clostridium perfringens has been determined. The plasmid genome comprises 10,207 bp and has a dA + dT content of 75%. Functions have been tentatively assigned to 6 of the 10 open reading frames and an origin-like region of repeated sequence identified. The codon usage of this extremely dA + dT rich plasmid is highly unusual and displays a pronounced preference for codons with the lowest dG + dC content. Only one of the genes from pIP404 was expressed at a significant level in Escherichia coli, suggesting that the atypical codon usage could represent a major obstacle to heterologous gene expression.
TI  - Simplified methods for the microbiological evaluation of bottled natural mineral  waters.
AB  - The conventional methods for the microbiological examination of natural mineral water were compared with a simplified procedure. The results indicate that when indicator micro-organisms are present in water, they may not be detected in the simplified method. An alternative procedure, including the determination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is suggested.
TI  - Beta-glucuronidase activity related to bacterial growth in common bile duct bile  in gallstone patients.
AB  - Beta-glucuronidase activity in the bile may be of importance in the etiology of pigment gallstones. This enzyme is of hepatic or bacterial origin. We have described a method to measure the activity of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile, using 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid as substrate. The method was used to measure the beta-glucuronidase activity in the bile from 51 patients with gallstone disease. This activity was related to the presence of beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the bile. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, and Clostridium perfringens were the only species found to produce beta-glucuronidase. Patients with beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria had on an average significantly higher enzyme activity in the bile than patients without such bacteria (p less than 0.01). The limitations of using artificial substrates in this type of studies are discussed.

TI  - Cefotaxime lavage in children undergoing appendicectomy.
AB  - In an attempt to reduce postoperative sepsis, a series of randomised, double-blind studies was begun in 1982, using cefotaxime as backbone therapy. Up to 1985 (stages I and II), the best results were obtained using a combination of cefotaxime (75 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses at 12-hourly intervals) plus metronidazole (10 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses), both drugs administered 1 hour before surgery (preoperatively) or at anaesthetic induction (peroperatively). In 300 consecutive cases, the wound infection rates were 1% in uncomplicated acute appendicitis and 5% in perforated/gangrenous appendices. The present study (stage III) reports the findings in 401 consecutive patients: 215 treated with the above regimen, either pre- or perioperatively (group 1) and 186 who additionally had peritoneal lavage with cefotaxime 2 g/L during surgery (group 2). There were 16 wound infections overall, 2 among patients administered prophylaxis preoperatively and 14 in those administered prophylaxis perioperatively. All produced mixed cultures, with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus milleri and Bacteroides fragilis predominating. The overall figures for postoperative sepsis are 12/215 (5.6%) in the non-lavage group and 8/186 (4.3%) in the lavage group. Among patients with a perforated and/or gangrenous appendix, the wound infection rate was 8/72 (11.1%) in the non-lavage group (group 1) and 4/66 (6.1%) in the lavage group (group 2). Each group had 2 cases of pelvic abscess.
TI  - Development of a new shuttle plasmid system for Escherichia coli and Clostridium  perfringens.
AB  - We constructed a 7.9-kilobase-pair recombinant shuttle plasmid, designated pHR106, by combining desired segments of three plasmids: an Escherichia coli plasmid (pSL100) which provides a multiple cloning site, a Clostridium perfringens plasmid (pJU122) which provides a clostridial origin of replication, and an E. coli plasmid (pJIR62) which provides an E. coli origin of replication, an ampicillin resistance gene, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene of clostridial origin. The shuttle plasmid transformed E. coli HB101 with a frequency of 1 transformant per 10(4) viable cells and C. perfringens L-phase strain L-13 with a frequency of approximately 1 transformant per 10(6) viable cells. Because of the set of unique cloning sites and the chloramphenicol resistance marker, this shuttle plasmid should be particularly useful for studies of gene regulation and for enzyme production with C. perfringens.
TI  - Transformation of Clostridium perfringens L forms with shuttle plasmid DNA.
AB  - L-form (L-phase) cultures of Clostridium perfringens were tested for their transformability with plasmid DNA. Three L-form strains were transformable, but one, strain L-13, was superior to the others. This strain was easily and reproducibly transformed with previously described shuttle vectors which were derived from either C. perfringens or Escherichia coli. Strain L-13 was transformable by a variety of methods, and a new micromethod worked well under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The maximal number of transformants was attained after strain L-13 was exposed for 4 h to the transforming DNA and polyethylene glycol. Viable counts determined in tubes of semisolid brain heart infusion medium containing 10% sucrose, with or without 2 micrograms of tetracycline per ml, showed a transformation rate of 3.9 X 10(-5) (transformants per viable cells).
TI  - Effects of sulphasalazine on faecal flora in patients with rheumatoid arthritis:  a comparison with penicillamine.
AB  - Twenty-six out-patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomly allocated to treatment with sulphasalazine (SASP) or D-penicillamine (DPA). Faecal samples were collected from all patients at 4-weekly intervals and examined for changes in faecal flora during treatment. Both treatment groups showed substantial clinical improvement. In the SASP-treated group this was accompanied by significant falls in counts of Cl. perfringens and E. coli. No such changes were seen in the DPA-treated group. These results suggest that SASP's efficacy in RA may be related to its antibacterial properties.
TI  - Comparison of faecal florae in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and controls.
AB  - The faecal flora of 25 out-patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was compared with that of 25 age- and sex-matched controls. A comprehensive survey revealed a significantly higher carriage rate of Clostridium perfringens in the RA population (88%) than controls (48%) (p less than 0.01). Coliform counts also tended to be higher, but there were no other significant differences between patients and controls. When the study was enlarged to include a further 113 RA patients with variable disease activity and a further 38 controls, clostridia were again more frequently carried by those with RA (70%) than controls (45%) (p less than 0.01) and clostridial counts were significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.006). Moreover, counts in patients with active or moderately active disease were significantly higher than in those with inactive disease (p less than 0.001). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Cl. perfringens plays a role in triggering or is otherwise associated with disease activity in RA. The findings may be alternatively an effect of the disease or its treatment with, for example, anti-inflammatory drugs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - The influence of various bacteria on the cecal mucosa of monoflora chickens infected with Eimeria tenella. A scanning electron microscopic study.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at the age of 2 days by an oral inoculation of one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis). Two days later the chickens were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocytes per bird). There were four groups: uninfected birds as controls, the birds infected with either bacteria or E. tenella alone, and the birds infected with bacteria and E. tenella. As observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) seven days after E. tenella infection, damage of the cecal mucosa in all groups infected with bacteria + E. tenella was more severe than in that infected with E. tenella alone. Most severe damage to the cecal mucosa was found in the birds infected with either C. perfringens or B. thermophilum combined with E. tenella.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-2588, a new oral cephalosporin, compared with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - T-2588, the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of T-2525, [6R, 7R]-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetoamido] -3- [(5-methyl-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)methyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, is a new oral cephalosporin. T-2525 had a widely expanded antibacterial spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. T-2525 was more active in vitro than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Moreover, it exhibited superior in vitro activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. T-2525 was highly stable to various beta-lactamases, which were classified as Richmond and Sykes types Ia, Ib, Ic, III, IV, and Vc. It had high affinities for the lethal (essential) penicillin-binding proteins of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis. T-2588 had excellent therapeutic effect on systemic infections in mice with various species of gram-negative bacteria, including beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
TI  - Cryptosporidiosis associated with bacterial enteritis in a goat kid.
AB  - A 7-day-old male Nubian-Alpine crossbred goat was examined because of listlessness, anorexia, and diarrhea. The presumptive diagnosis was severe enteritis. Large numbers of Clostridium perfringens and a non-pathogenic heavily encapsulated Escherichia coli were isolated from the feces. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified on the qualitative fecal examination. The kid improved after treatment with fluids and antibiotics.
TI  - Effect of water coagulation by seeds of Moringa oleifera on bacterial concentrations.
AB  - The effects of a Sudanese water purification method traditionally used in Sudan to treat turbid waters were studied with respect to turbidity reduction and removal of faecal indicator bacteria as well as selected enteric bacterial pathogens. Water treatment was performed at 30 degrees C with Moringa oleifera seed material as a coagulant, and the technique employed corresponded closely to that used to clarify turbid water in Sudanese villages. A turbidity reduction of 80.0-99.5% paralleled by a primary bacterial reduction of 1-4 log units (90.00-99.99%) was obtained within the first 1 to 2 h of treatment, the bacteria being concentrated in the coagulated sediment. During the 24 h observation period a secondary bacterial increase due to regrowth in the supernatant water was consistently observed for Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella sonnei, in some cases for Escherichia coli, but not for Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens. The potential of the method when compared with some alternative for the improvement of rural drinking water supplies is discussed.
TI  - Effect of infection with Eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. There were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and E. tenella. Seven days after E. tenella infection, counts of B. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for E. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by B. thermophilum alone, whereas 10 days after E. tenella infection, counts were higher for E. tennella-infected birds. The population of L. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the E. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. No significant differences were observed between the numbers of B. vulgatus, C. perfringens, and S. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without E. tenella infections.
TI  - Identification of Tn4451 and Tn4452, chloramphenicol resistance transposons from  Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The recombinant plasmids pJIR45 and pJIR97 contain the chloramphenicol resistance determinants derived from the Clostridium perfringens R plasmids pIP401 and pJIR27, respectively. Escherichia coli cultures which harbored these recombinant plasmids rapidly became chloramphenicol sensitive when grown in the absence of chloramphenicol. The loss of resistance was associated with the loss of 6.2-kilobase (kb) segments from both plasmids. Detailed restriction analysis of E. coli- and C. perfringens-derived deletion plasmids indicated that deletion of these segments was essentially precise. Transposition of the 6.2-kb segments was demonstrated by cloning the determinants into a temperature-sensitive plasmid, curing the recombinant plasmids, and selecting chloramphenicol-resistant, plasmid-free clones. Southern hybridization analysis of chromosomal DNA isolated from these recA E. coli clones indicated that the 6.2-kb segments had transposed to different sites on the chromosome. Heteroduplex analysis and restriction mapping indicated that the transposons, Tn4451 (pIP401) and Tn4452 (pJIR27), were closely related and did not contain large inverted or directly repeated sequences. These transposons represent the first transposable elements from the clostridia to be identified and characterized.
TI  - Chemical and biological properties of acetyl derivatives of the hydroxylamino reduction products of metronidazole and dimetridazole.
AB  - Metronidazole and related 5-nitroimidazoles undergo reduction of their nitro group apparently to produce such reactive species as 5-hydroxylaminoimidazoles. To define the role of these species we have sought ways to prepare them by the catalytic reduction of metronidazole, dimetridazole and flunidazole. Although their respective 5-hydroxylaminoimidazoles were too unstable to be isolated directly, their O,N-diacetyl derivatives were isolable. Of these, the diacetyl derivative of the hydroxylamine derived from dimetridazole, O,N-diacetyl-1,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxylaminoimidazole (DiacDMH), was used for further study. DiacDMH was converted to its monoacetyl derivative, N-acetyl-1,2-dimethyl-5-hydroxylaminoimidazole (AcDMH), by enzymatic deacylation. Both DiacDMH and AcDMH were examined for bactericidal activity against such strains as Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli strain SR58, which are known to be sensitive to dimetridazole, as well as a variety of other bacteria. No bactericidal activity was detected, even in the presence of deacetylating enzymes. As the 5-hydroxylaminoimidazole itself could not be shown to form in these bacterial incubations, it remains uncertain whether or not the hydroxylamino functionality of a 5-nitroimidazole has bactericidal activity.
TI  - CC/GG contacts facilitate the B to A transition of DNA in solution.
AB  - Self-complementary decadeoxynucleotides, CCGATATCGG, CCAGATCTGG, CCCTGCAGGG, GGGGGCCCCC, were designed and synthesized to estimate the A-philic free energy of CC/GG contacts. First, regions of temperature-stability of the double-stranded conformation were determined for each 10-mer. Then, circular dichroism spectra were recorded for the B-family forms at different temperatures, counter-ion concentrations and trifluoroethanol contents. A cooperative change typical of the B-A transition is observed in the CD spectra at a trifluoroethanol content specific for each duplex. The positions of half-transition points were functions not only of the nucleotide sequence but of the duplex length as well: the B to A transitions were hindered in these 10-mers in comparison with a lengthy DNA. The B-phility value was estimated to be 3 kcal/mol of 10-mer. The B-A transition point was shown to drop with an increase in the number of CC/GG contacts in a duplex. The designed 10-mers made it possible to estimate quantitatively the A-phility of CC/GG contact as compared with an average DNA: (FA-FB)CC = 0.2 Kcal/mol, (FA-FB)DNA = 0.7 Kcal/mol.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocinogenic plasmid from Clostridium perfringens and  molecular genetic analysis of the bacteriocin-encoding gene.
AB  - The bacteriocinogenic plasmid pIP404 from Clostridium perfringens was isolated and cloned in Escherichia coli, and its physical map was deduced. Expression of the bcn gene, encoding bacteriocin BCN5, is inducible by UV irradiation of C. perfringens and thus resembles the SOS-regulated bacteriocin genes of enteric bacteria. The location of bcn on pIP404 was established by a dot-blot procedure, using specific hybridization probes to analyze mRNA samples from induced and uninduced cultures. From the nucleotide sequence of its gene, the molecular weight of BCN5 was deduced to be 96,591, and a protein of this size was secreted by bacteriocin-producing cultures of C. perfringens. The primary structure of the protein suggests that it may function as an ionophore, since a hydrophobic domain, resembling those of the ionophoric colicins, is present at the COOH terminus. No bacteriocin activity could be detected in E. coli harboring plasmids bearing the bcn gene, even when the transcriptional and translational signals were replaced by those of lacZ. A possible explanation may be found in the unusual codon usage of the adenine-thymine-rich bcn gene, as this shows a preference for codons with a high adenine-plus-thymine content, especially in the wobble position. Many of the frequently used codons correspond to those recognized by minor tRNA species in E. coli. Consequently, bcn expression might be limited by tRNA availability in this bacterium.
TI  - Some aspects of the occurrence of resistant bacteria in the normal animal flora.
AB  - The paper outlines some of the problems encountered in assessing the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in the normal flora of animals, using Escherichia coli as an example. Additional information is provided on the occurrence and mechanisms of resistance in Clostridium perfringens, Pasteurella haemolytica and Staphylococcus aureus, and some of the factors which may affect this resistance. The paper concludes with general considerations about the choice of organism, the sample size and the desirability of designing standard protocols.
TI  - The significance of clostridial isolates in intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  - In order to evaluate the significance of clostridial species in intra-abdominal infections, the bacteriology records of three hospitals were reviewed during a period of five years. Included in this report were 41 patients from whom clostridial species were recovered from specimens of free peritoneal fluid, abscess cavities or bile. Seven patients died for a mortality rate of 17.1 per cent. Most patients had polymicrobial infections of which clostridial organisms were one of the several anaerobes isolated. Clostridium perfringens was the single most frequently noted species, identified in 23 of the patients, but it was not associated with a different mortality rate than was observed for the other clostridial species. Clostridial bacteremia was uncommon and demonstrated in only one patient. The mean age of the patients was 56.4 years; 56.2 for males and 56.8 for females. Neither age nor sex of the patient influenced the likelihood of survival. The source of the clostridial isolates--bile, abscess cavity or free peritoneal fluid--had no effect upon the outcome. Several underlying conditions were responsible for the intraperitoneal clostridial organisms identified in this series. Only mesenteric infarction proved significantly predictive of a fatal result. Antibiotic coverage specifically directed against clostridia did not influence survival.
TI  - Control of an outbreak of wet-tail in a closed colony of hamster (Mesocricetus auratus).
AB  
TI  - Potent antagonism of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium,  and Enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - Interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae serogroup non O1, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (MCM). Potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. The four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. The seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. Sh. Flexneri and Staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of E. coli alone. C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae serogroup non O1 were excluded in the presence of E. coli with B. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. S. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. When the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, C. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. Sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.
TI  - An evaluation of various working practices in shops selling raw and cooked meats.
AB  - Three groups of premises (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. Salmonellas were not detected, but Escherichia coli, and to a lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. Contamination of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. The presence of E. coli or Str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. A number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with E. coli, and many also contained Clostridium perfringens. Fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. The use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. In general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. The possible reasons for this finding are discussed.
TI  - Lethal effect of butylated hydroxyanisole as related to bacterial fatty acid composition.
AB  - Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas fragi, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella "anatum" were challenged with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Susceptibility was measured as the concentration of BHA required to cause a 90% reduction in bacterial survivors. Staphylococcus aureus LP and P. fragi were two of the most resistant species examined; C. perfringens and P. fluorescens were the most susceptible. Gram stain reaction was found not to be a strict indicator of bacterial susceptibility to BHA. There was no obvious relationship between individual fatty acids and susceptibility. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the total lipid fraction of only the gram-positive species was related to susceptibility. The ratios of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of other fractions were not related to susceptibility.
TI  - Relationships between rotavirus diarrhea and intestinal microflora establishment  in conventional and gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Intestinal microflora did not play a role in the intensity or course of EDIM rotavirus-induced diarrhea, since similar results were observed in axenic and conventional mice. In conventional mice, rotavirus-induced diarrhea did not modify the establishment of Lactobacillus spp. and Escherichia coli before weaning. The consequences of diarrhea on the establishment of strictly anaerobic bacteria after weaning were studied through the measurement of two bacterial functions, the microbial barrier effect against E. coli and the development of the immunoglobulin A intestinal immune system. These two bacterial functions were expressed in a similar way in diarrheic and control mice. In young gnotobiotic mice inoculated with Clostridium perfringens or C. difficile, rotavirus infection led to an earlier development of both strains, as compared with controls. This effect was more pronounced with C. difficile. These results suggest that rotavirus infections might enhance opportunistic bacterial infections.
TI  - The efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  - A reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. Pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. A 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. The intestine was then divided at each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. The segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. This experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. Within three days 40% of the animals receiving pefloxacin died. Animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only 5% of these animals died. Thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in bile from the common bile duct in patients treated with endoscopic papillotomy for gallstone disease.
AB  - This paper reports the occurrence of beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the bile in gallstone patients treated with endoscopic papillotomy (EPT). The study included 36 patients--18 women and 18 men, aged 43-87 years, with a median of 72.5 years. Bile sampling was done with an endoscopic technique. All bacterial strains were tested for beta-glucuronidase activity with a rapid chromogenic tablet test, using 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid as substrate. Bacterial growth was found in the bile in 35 patients. Of 103 strains isolated, 30 produced beta-glucuronidase. Twenty-five of the patients had at least one beta-glucuronidase-producing strain in the bile. All 26 strains of Escherichia coli were producing the enzyme. Both strains in the Bacteroides fragilis group and one out of two strains of Clostridium perfringens were producing beta-glucuronidase. The activity of the bacterial beta-glucuronidase was found within the pH range of the bile in these patients. A relationship between the presence of beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the bile and pigment gallstone is suggested.
TI  - Gangrenous cholecystitis and acute cholangitis associated with anaerobic bacteria in bile.
AB  - The incidence of anaerobic bacteria in bile, and the relationship between bacterial species isolated from the bile and the clinical characteristics of disease in these patients was studied. One hundred and twenty-five bile specimens obtained during surgery from the same number of patients were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Seventy patients (56%) had positive cultures and in 30% of the patients with positive cultures anaerobic bacteria were recovered, usually together with aerobic bacteria. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic organisms. There was a high rate of isolation of anaerobic bacteria from bile in patients with gangrenous cholecystitis (72%) or acute cholangitis (50%). Administration of antibiotics effective against anaerobic bacteria should be considered when treating these diseases.
TI  - The seasonality of bacterial quality of water in a tropical developing country (Sierra Leone).
AB  - Natural water sources used as drinking-water supplies by rural settlements in Sierra Leone were examined monthly over a one-year period to detect any seasonal variations in bacterial quality. The 37 degrees C colony count, levels of selected faecal indicator bacteria and the incidence of Salmonella spp. were monitored. A seasonality was demonstrated for all the variables, counts generally increasing with the progression of the dry season, culminating in peaks at the transition from dry to wet season. Some complications with respect to the interpretation of counts of faecal indicator bacteria from raw tropical waters are noted.
TI  - Opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  - Guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (CRF) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. Infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. From 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. Faecal streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter spp., C. freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. Variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. Elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the CRF of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.
TI  - Prevalence of various enteropathogens in the feces of diarrheic and healthy calves.
AB  - The presence of various enteropathogens was examined in the feces of homebred dairy calves reared in a restricted geographical area of France (North West of County of Indre-et-Loire) during winter 1983-1984. Two distinct surveys were carried on: a case-control study including 32 diarrheic calves and 21 healthy calves bred in 53 different farms; and a separate study on nine diarrheic calves in another farm. The following infectious agents were looked for, by specific methods of detection: Escherichia coli K99 and E. coli lethal for mice, Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens, Chlamydia psittaci, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, Cryptosporidium. In the case-control survey, no enterotoxigenic E. coli (K99+) was detected in either group of calves. Four agents were more often detected in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves, i.e. rotavirus (12/32 vs 1/21), lethal E. coli (6/32 vs 1/21), Cryptosporidium (2/32 vs 0/21) and Salmonella typhimurium (1/32 vs 0/21). One at least of these four agents was present in 16 diarrheic calves (50%) vs only 2 healthy calves (10%) (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and of C. perfringens, enterotoxin was similar in both groups of calves, accounting respectively for about 20% and 10% of total calves. Moreover, coronavirus-like particles were significatively associated with healthy calves (7/32 vs 11/21; P less than 0.05). In the other study, all the main categories of enteropathogens were detected throughout the period of observation in the same farm with the exception of enterotoxigenic E. coli. But each calf taken individually was rarely shedding more than two agents at a time. In addition, specific antibodies against C. perfringens enterotoxin, as tested in an ELISA test, were present in the serum of all the calves examined in both surveys. This study confirms the primary role of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium as agents of diarrhea in calves under three weeks. It also suggests the possible participation of E. coli strains that are lethal for mice and underlines the potential hazard for human health of bovine reservoirs of Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  - Diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. About one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. Many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. Among the viral infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; Norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear to occur worldwide. Enteropathogenic (EPEC) and, especially, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. Shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. Yersinia enterocolitica is rare in tropical countries. Cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (V. cholerae non-01, V. mimicus, V. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. Clostridium perfringens type C is the causal agent of Enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially New Guinea. C. difficile appears to be of minor importance. Among the parasites Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. Macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella and E. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.
TI  - Protection of the nursing pig against experimentally induced enteric colibacillosis by vaccination of dam with fimbrial antigens of E coli (K88, K99 and 987P).
AB  - Pregnant gilts were vaccinated with two doses of alhydrogel adsorbed fimbrial antigens of Escherichia coli (K88ab, K88ac, K99 and 987P) supplemented with beta toxoid of Clostridium perfringens type C. Their piglets, and piglets of nonvaccinated gilts, were subsequently orogastrically challenged with one or other of the four fimbrial types of enteropathogenic E coli. Some of the vaccinated animals were reinjected with a single dose of the vaccine during second gestation and their piglets, and piglets of non-vaccinated sows, were challenged the same way as were litters of gilts. Blood serum and colostra were examined for antibodies to the four fimbrial antigens of E coli and for antitoxin to beta toxin of C perfringens type C. It was found that: (1) a highly significant reduction in mortality and morbidity was achieved in vaccinated litters against all four challenge strains of E coli; (2) excretion of K88ab and K88ac but not of K99 and 987P challenge strains was significantly reduced; (3) revaccination of sows by a single dose of the vaccine during second gestation conferred complete protection against mortality and highly significant protection against morbidity; (4) no correlation was noted between colostral or seroagglutinins to fimbrial antigens of E coli and mortality rates in litters challenged with homologous fimbrial types of E coli, but good correlation was found between colostral precipitins to K88 antigens and mortality rates in litters; (5) antitoxin value in 97 per cent of colostrum of vaccinated sows was 10 iu equivalent of C perfringens type C toxin or more per ml of colostrum.
TI  - Alcohol induced B-A transition of DNAs with different base compositions studied by circular dichroism.
AB  - The circular dichroic (CD) spectra of natural DNAs (from Cl. perfringens, T2 phage, calf thymus, E. coli, and M. lysodeikticus) as well as duplexes of synthetic DNAs (poly(dA) X poly(dT), poly(dA-dT), and poly(dG-dC] were measured in water-ethanol mixtures with 0.3 mM NaCl. A conformational change from the B to the A form was observed for the natural DNAs on adding ethanol. The ethanol concentration that induces the transition and the extent of the change in the CD spectrum are different for the five natural DNAs depending on their GC contents. The higher the GC content is, the more easily the transition to the A form takes place. The results indicate that the GC content of a DNA is an important factor for induction of the B-A transition. The results for the synthetic DNAs show that their properties cannot be inferred by simple extrapolation of those of natural DNAs. Coexisting ions and the molecular weight of a DNA were also found to affect the induction of the B-A transition.
TI  - Evolution and epidemiology of MLS resistance.
AB  - Within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (MLS). This paper is limited to a description of the evolution of different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. Only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. Three groups will therefore be studied in turn: Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis. There is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of MLSB resistance observed in Clostridium perfringens and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Worldwide distribution of the conjugative Clostridium perfringens tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCW3.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that all conjugative R-plasmids  of Clostridium perfringens are closely related to the previously characterized tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCW3. Fourteen conjugative R-plasmids derived from 11 C. perfringens strains isolated in Australia, the United States, France, Belgium, and Japan were analyzed. Eleven of the plasmids encoded tetracycline resistance while three carried both tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance. Each of these plasmids was compared, by restriction analysis, to the reference plasmid, pCW3. Seven of the tetracycline resistance plasmids had EcoRI, XbaI, and ClaI restriction profiles that were identical to those of the corresponding pCW3 digests. The seven remaining R-plasmids were different from pCW3. Comparison of partial restriction maps of these plasmids with a complete map of pCW3 indicated that they contained at least 17 kb of DNA that also was present in pCW3. Hybridization analysis confirmed that these plasmids shared substantial homology with pCW3. The three tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance plasmids frequently lost a 6-kb chloramphenicol resistance segment during conjugation. Cloning experiments showed that the chloramphenicol resistance determinant was expressed in Escherichia coli and that the chloramphenicol resistance gene of one of these plasmids, pIP401, was contained within a 1.5-kb region of the 6-kb deletion segment. Hybridization analysis indicated that the deletion segment of pIP401 was related to those of the other two chloramphenicol resistance plasmids. During the course of this study, conjugative R-plasmids which appear to be identical to pCW3 or closely related to pCW3 were identified from C. perfringens strains from human, animal and environmental sources in five countries. It is concluded that C. perfringens strains in humans and animals throughout the world have overlapping gene pools and that all the conjugative C. perfringens R-plasmids examined probably evolved from a pCW3-like element.

TI  - Bacterial isolates from Nsukka meat market: a zoonotic appraisal.
AB  - Swabs collected from butchers hands, knives, tables and meat displayed for sale at Nsukka meat market showed that every item screened was contaminated. Bacteria isolated include Streptococcus faecalis, coagulase positive Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Brucella species, Corynebacterium haemolyticum, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas multophilia, P. rubescens and beta-haemolytic Streptococci. The zoonotic or public health implications of such contaminations, their probable sources and possible ways of minimizing them are discussed.
TI  - Effect of fecal pollution on Vibrio parahaemolyticus densities in an estuarine environment.
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus densities in the Narragansett Bay, R.I., estuary were found to significantly correlate with the level of fecal pollution in the water. Results of field investigations showed a definite association between the levels of this organism and those of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and enterococci. Densities of V. parahaemolyticus were greatest in the near-surface waters of contaminated areas and decreased sharply with both the distance from the sources of fecal pollution and the depth of the water column. A positive association with the amount of particulate matter in the water and specifically with its zooplankton content also was found. No association was obtained with any of the physical or chemical parameters examined except dissolved oxygen. The results of laboratory studies on the growth of V. parahaemolyticus in collected estuarine waters were consistent with the field observations in that nutrients in sewage did not directly produce any increase in natural or inoculated levels of the organism. Of several particulates added to the water, only chitin and net zooplankters (live or dead) supported the growth of V. parahaemolyticus. The addition of sewage to the water had no measurable effect, whether or not the various particulates also were present. The data show that wastewater effluents have an effect on V. parahaemolyticus densities in this estuary and indicate that the effect is indirect, probably mediated by biostimulation of the food chain and manifested at the level of the microfauna.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of the Clostridium perfringens tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCW3.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens strain CW92 carries pCW3, a conjugative 47-kb plasmid that confers inducible resistance to tetracycline. The plasmid was examined by restriction endonuclease analysis and by cloning each of the five ClaI fragments of pCW3 in Escherichia coli, using pBR322. Analysis of the recombinant plasmids allowed the deduction of a detailed restriction map of pCW3. The tetracycline resistance determinant of pCW3 was mapped by examining the phenotype of recombinant E. coli clones derived from the cloning, into pUC vector plasmids, of EcoRI fragments from pCW3. The C. perfringens tetracycline resistance determinant was expressed in E. coli and was shown to be located on two juxtaposed EcoRI fragments which together encompass a 4-kb region of pCW3. Deletion experiments showed that the tetracycline resistance gene, and/or its control regions, contained internal EcoRI and SphI sites. E. coli strains that carried recombinant plasmids with only the 4-kb region were found to express tetracycline resistance constitutively. In contrast, recombinant plasmids harboring a 10.5-kb ClaI fragment of pCW3, that included the 4-kb region, coded for an inducible tetracycline resistance phenotype. The existence of a negatively regulated resistance gene, similar to that proposed for several other bacteria is postulated.
TI  - Verotoxin and neuraminidase induced platelet aggregating activity in plasma: their possible role in the pathogenesis of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
AB  - Certain strains of Escherichia coli producing verotoxin have been isolated in the stools of patients with the haemolytic uraemic syndrome. A platelet aggregating activity has been found in normal plasma after incubation with verotoxin at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This activity, unlike neuraminidase, has an effect that is independent of changing factor VIII related antigen, but requires the IIA and IIIB platelet surface glycoprotein (deficient in thrombasthenia) to mediate its effect. Prostacyclin totally inhibited this effect, but other antiplatelet drugs and heparin were without inhibitory effects.
TI  - Determination of mercury and organomercurial resistance in obligate anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A methodology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of inorganic and organomercurial compounds for obligate anaerobic bacteria is described. A wide variation in the susceptibility of anaerobic clinical and sewage isolates was observed. Isolates of Bacteroides ruminicola and Clostridium perfringens resistant to mercury were examined for their plasmid content and ability to demonstrate inducible resistance. None of the resistant anaerobes contained any plasmids, while resistant facultative isolates from the same source contained several plasmids. In 24 h, resistant strains of clostridia and Bacteroides volatilized 20 and 43% of the 203Hg2+ added to cultures, while Escherichia coli R100 and a sewage isolate of Enterobacter cloacae volatilized 63 and 27%, respectively, of the added 203Hg2+. Attempts to induce mercury resistance in the aerobic isolates were successful, but no induction was seen in the anaerobes. Thus, mercury resistance in these anaerobic isolates was neither inducible nor plasmid mediated.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of goat's milk. A Public Health Laboratory Service survey.
AB  - In a 12-month survey (June 1982-May 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. The statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. Surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees C and by 76% at 22 degrees C. There were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 Escherichia coli per ml in 91%. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. Only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. The methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. No sample was Brucella ring-test-positive. Experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored goat's milk showed that Bacillus cereus, Staph. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees C. Clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while Campylobacter jejuni did not grow. The results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - The relative importance of enteric pathogens affecting neonates of domestic animals.
AB  
TI  - [Pathogenesis, clinical aspects and diagnosis of the most important enteric bacterial diseases in animals].
AB  - There are adhesive and invasive species among enteropathogenic bacteria for animals. Most frequently isolated adhesive bacteria are enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Salmonella, T. hyodysenteriae, M. paratuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica, Cl. perfringens and C. jejuni bacteria represent the most important invasive germs. The main clinical finding connected with bacterial enteritis is diarrhoea resp. dysentery. Evaluation of feces consistency, time of appearance and accompanying symptoms (e.g. fever, colic) allow a clinical suspective diagnosis, however a definitive diagnosis must be based on the demonstration of the causative agent. In addition to known cultural, microscopic, biochemical and serological diagnostic methods, the demonstration of virulence factors (enterotoxin formation, adhesive pili) plays an important role in diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
TI  - 23Na NMR relaxation study of the effects of conformation and base composition on  the interactions of counterions with double-helical DNA.
AB  - NMR relaxation rates (T1(-1) and T2(-1)) have been determined for 23Na in aqueous salt solutions containing various types of helical double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acids. These measurements were performed on three synthetic polynucleotides having different overall conformations, poly-(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) (alternating B-DNA), poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) at low salt (B-DNA), and Br-poly(dG-dC).Br-poly(dG-dC) (left-handed Z-DNA), and on four types of natural DNA differing in base composition, Clostridium perfringens (26% GC), calf thymus (40% GC), Escherichia coli (50% GC), and Micrococcus lysodeikticus (72% GC). For all types of DNA investigated, except poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT), the 23Na NMR spectra measured at 21 degrees C and an applied field of 4.7 T are non-Lorentzian. These non-Lorentzian spectra were analyzed on the basis of the two-state model and the standard theory of nonexponential quadrupolar relaxation processes in order to obtain estimates of the correlation times (tau c) characteristic of the sodium nuclei associated with the various nucleic acids. All of the correlation times estimated in this way are in the range of nanoseconds. The magnitudes of these correlation times show a significant dependence on the overall conformation of the nucleic acid (B vs. Z) but not on its base composition. To investigate the concentration dependence of tau c, sodium or magnesium salts were added to solutions of Br-poly(dG-dC).Br-poly(dG-dC) (Z-DNA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Shuttle plasmids for Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Small plasmids which replicate in both Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens were made by recombining E. coli plasmid pBR322 with three different small (less than 4 kilobases) plasmids native to C. perfringens. Subsequently, two homologous, though distinct, tetracycline resistance determinants (tet) from other C. perfringens plasmids were cloned into them. Both tet systems made E. coli resistant to at least 5 micrograms of tetracycline per ml when resident on the shuttle plasmids. The shuttle vectors have been used to transform L-phase variants and autoplasts of C. perfringens. In the latter case, the intact transforming plasmid could be isolated from walled cells after cell wall regeneration. Reciprocal transformation experiments in which plasmid DNAs derived from E. coli or C. perfringens were used suggest that restriction barriers exist between these two organisms. The plasmids contain restriction enzyme recognition sites in locations which are useful for cloning experiments.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid in South Indian women.
AB  - Samples of amniotic fluid obtained from 48 South Indian women in the third trimester of pregnancy were studied for antimicrobial activity. The growth of Staphylococcus albus, Candida albicans and Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by nearly all samples studied while the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 50%, 42% and 18% of samples respectively. The growth of Streptococcus faecalis was not inhibited. Using radial immunodiffusion, IgG was measurable in all 10 samples studied (mean 23 mg/dl), whereas IgA was measurable in only three of these samples (mean 1.32 mg/dl). However, while specific IgA against C. albicans was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 93% of samples, specific IgG against C. albicans was detected in only 26% of samples (P less than 0.001). Amniotic fluid obtained from parous women had greater inhibitory activity against E. coli (P less than 0.05) than did the amniotic fluid obtained from nulliparae.
TI  - Comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  - It is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. Although the effect of most of these toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. The resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. The biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. The duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. Subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. The heat-labile toxins of V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella spp., A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. Similarly the heat-stable toxins of E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. Classified along with the enterotoxin of C. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by Sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of E. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. In another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by Staph. aureus until more is known. Surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological and structural differences. Evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. The structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. It is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like V. cholerae.
TI  - Bile acid deconjugation and attachment of chicken gut bacteria: their possible role in growth depression.
AB  - Bacteria isolated from the chicken gut were tested for their ability to deconjugate bile acids and attach to chicken epithelial cells (crop squamous cells and duodenal brush borders). Clostridium perfringens, streptococci and some of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were able to deconjugate all 4 substrates whereas the bacteroides deconjugated only the taurine conjugates and the coliforms were completely inactive. None of the strains of Escherichia coli or streptococci attached to squamous cells, but the anaerogenic coliform, the strain of Klebsiella aerogenes and the lactobacilli did show attachment. Attachment to brush borders was obtained with the anaerogenic coliforms, K. aerogenes, 2 out of 5 of the lactobacilli, and 4 out of 9 of the streptococci, but none of the strains of E. coli.
TI  - The influence of drugs on the response of a cell culture preparation to bacterial toxins.
AB  - The influence was studied of lanthanum chloride, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, indomethacin and sodium cromoglycate on the morphological changes induced in Vero cells by the action of the cholera toxin, the thermolabile enterotoxin (LT) and the Vero cell cytotoxin (VT) of Escherichia coli, the enterotoxin of Clostridium perfringens, and the cytotoxin of Clostridium difficile. These drugs were able to inhibit the effects produced by C. difficile cytotoxin but not by the other toxins examined.
TI  - [Recent advances in the molecular mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, in particular of diphtheria, cholera, coli, botulinum and shigella toxins as well as tetanospasmin and the toxins of staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - Great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. Proportions of toxins of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the NAD and ADP-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. Thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. The cholera toxin and the L-toxin from Escherichia coli have a similar structure. They transfer an ADP-ribose portion from NAD to the GTP-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the GTPase activity is reduced. The increase of the cAMP content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. The tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. The botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.
TI  - The significance of anaerobic bacteria in biliary tract infection after hepatic portoenterostomy for biliary atresia.
AB  - Aspiration of the biliary atrium was performed in six children who developed cholangitis after hepatic portoenterostomy (Kasai procedure). All aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria were recovered in all six specimens and anaerobic organisms were recovered in three. The predominant aerobic organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae (four isolates), enterococcus (three isolates, and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The anaerobes recovered were Bacteroides fragilis (two) and Clostridium perfringens (one). These findings demonstrate the recovery of anaerobic as well as aerobic organisms in cholangitis after hepatic portoenterostomy.
TI  - The microbiology of selected retail food products with an evaluation of viable counting methods.
AB  - In an inter-laboratory survey, the pour plate, surface spread, agar droplet and spiral plate methods were used in parallel with the surface drop method for enumeration of micro-organisms in foods. Good agreement was obtained between all surface methods of enumeration, but there was poor agreement between molten agar methods and the surface drop method. A total of 1143 samples of food that were ready for consumption at the point of retail sale were examined. Eight types of food products were chosen: meat pasties, sausage rolls, real-cream slices, synthetic-cream slices, mayonnaise-based coleslaws, faggots, pates and continental sausages. The results of this survey suggest that the upper limit for an acceptable viable count should vary according to the food product. Salmonellae were not isolated on any occasion. Potentially harmful organisms were not isolated at levels expected to constitute a public health hazard. Information concerning the nature of the product, the total viable count, the presence or absence of pathogenic, toxigenic or indicator organisms, the spectrum of the bacterial flora and the relative predominance of each organism must all be considered when assessing the microbiological acceptability of retail 'ready to eat' products.
TI  - Effect of ligand binding on the buoyant density of DNA in Nycodenz gradients.
AB  - The effect of ligand binding upon the buoyant density of DNA in Nycodenz gradients has been studied using DNAs of differing base compositions. The effect of both intercalating ligands (ethidium bromide and proflavin) and non-intercalating ligands (distamycin A, DAPI and netropsin) has been studied. The binding of intercalating ligands to DNA has essentially no effect on the buoyant density of DNA in Nycodenz gradients. The non-intercalating ligands were found to increase the buoyant density of DNA in a base specific manner. The increase in buoyant density can be interpreted in terms of disruption of the hydration shell of the DNA molecule caused by the binding of the ligand along the minor groove of the DNA helix.
TI  - The intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  - The fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. Bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. Conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. The frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. Twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. The organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was Bifidobacterium breve. Bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent Bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was never isolated in this study. Further, the counts and incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum, C. perfringens, and Bacillus subtilis, the counts of C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis, and S. faecium and the incidences of C. difficile, C. tertium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
TI  - Infectious agents associated with diarrhoea in commercial rabbits: a field study.
AB  - Over a period of 9 months the occurrence of parasites, bacteria and viruses has been examined in diarrhoeic rabbits from 21 commercial rabbitries and related with clinical signs and gross and microscopic lesions. Infectious disease agents have been found in 71.5% of the animals. Escherichia coli (ATEC) were found to be attached to the luminal intestinal border of 40% of the rabbits examined. This was associated with moderate to high mortality, caecal oedema, severe swelling of mesenteric lymph nodes and high numbers of colibacilli attached to the epithelium of ileum, caecum and colon. Rotaviruses were detected in 35.4% of the animals. Disease associated with pure rota infection was usually mild and affected predominantly small intestine. A coronavirus associated with ATEC has been established in one rabbitry and coccidia were present in 18.5% of the animals. Multiple agents were found in 18.5% of the animals.

TI  - Cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - The enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by Dr. Pierce in 1905. The purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. A solution of 1 L of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 U heparin, and 5 mEq KCl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to Peptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis. In a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36 L over 2 days. No lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. In a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.
TI  - Effect of erythromycin on microbial antagonisms: a study in gnotobiotic mice associated with a human fecal flora.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin base was studied on intestinal resistance to colonization of gnotobiotic mice inoculated with a human fecal flora and challenged with six microbial strains potentially pathogenic for immunocompromised patients. Fecal concentrations of erythromycin were greater than 1,000 micrograms/g in the human donor and in mice. Total intestinal bacterial counts were not significantly different in the human donor and in the recipient mice and were not affected by erythromycin treatment. Strains of various species from the dominant flora (greater than 10(9) colony-forming units/g) and resistant to greater than 1,000 micrograms of erythromycin/ml were present before and persisted during treatment. Strains sensitive to such concentrations - particularly all enterobacteria-were eliminated. Treatment did not reduce colonization resistance against Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, and erythromycin-sensitive Escherichia coli. It reduced but did not eliminate some colonization resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile, and erythromycin-resistant E coli.
TI  - [Determination of in vivo and in vitro toxin activity. I. A new method of determining in vitro activity].
AB  - The potency of 5 toxins of different microbial species has been studied by common in vivo methods and by the in vitro method based on measuring the relative test-microbe growth inhibiting units 50. The possibility of using this method for the determination of toxicity in vitro with a view of studying the potency of diphtheria and gas-gangrene exotoxins, as well as that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin, is substantiated.
TI  - Investigation of the survival characteristics of Rhodococcus coprophilus and certain fecal indicator bacteria.
AB  - Rhodococcus coprophilus and Clostridium perfringens survived in fresh water samples held at 5, 20, and 30 degrees C for over 17 weeks, whereas Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci disappeared after 5 weeks at all three temperatures. R. coprophilus survived for more than 8 months in sterilized sewage and deionized water at all three temperatures, whereas in normal sewage held at 20 degrees C, the survival time was 12 to 26 weeks. In samples held at 30 degrees C, survival times were shorter, probably because of interbacterial competition or protozoal predation. The results indicate that R. coprophilus may be a useful indicator of the presence of remote fecal pollution of farm animal origin, but not of recent pollution, when enumerated alone in polluted waters or wastewaters.
TI  - The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria from pneumonic cattle lungs.
AB  - One hundred and forty-four lungs obtained postmortem from cattle with pneumonia were cultured for anaerobic bacteria. Forty-five lungs yielded 73 anaerobic isolates belonging to 20 species. The number of isolations of anaerobes from acute fibrinous or suppurative bronchopneumonias (32.5%) was slightly lower than from similar chronic bronchopneumonias (36.5%). Anaerobes were not recovered from 15 lungs showing macroscopic changes not of bacterial origin, nor from 13 healthy lungs. The predominant genera isolated were Bacteroides, Peptococcus, Fusobacterium and Clostridium. The most common species were P. indolicus (15 isolates), B. asaccharolyticus (nine), F. necrophorum (six), C. perfringens (four) and B. fragilis (four). There was a significant correlation between the presence of Corynebacterium pyogenes (p less than 0.001) or Escherichia coli (p less than 0.01) and the presence of anaerobes in the lungs. The isolated anaerobic bacteria were generally susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin G, cefoxitin, cephalothin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and metronidazole. The B. fragilis and C. perfringens isolates showed multiple antibiotic resistance, and five P. indolicus isolates were resistant to tetracycline.
TI  - The use of radiolabelled triostin antibiotics to measure low levels of binding to deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - Triostin antibiotics, which contain a cyclic peptide with a disulphide bridge, have been prepared by growing Streptomyces triostinicus in the presence of inorganic [35S]-sulphate. The labelled triostin A has been shown to behave in all respects similarly to the authentic natural product and to enable a much more sensitive radiochemical adaptation of the solvent-partition method for determining antibiotic binding to DNA. By this means, binding isotherms at low, biologically relevant levels (down to one antibiotic molecule per gene) have been measured. The results indicate the existence of some tight binding sites in natural DNA species that are preferentially occupied at low concentrations. No evidence has been found for any allosteric transitions provoked by interaction between these antibiotics and natural DNA species, though there is evidence for co-operativity in the binding of triostin A to poly(dA-dT). For the first time accurate isotherms have been determined for the binding of triostin C to DNA; its binding constants for a variety of polydeoxynucleotides are uniformly tighter than those of triostin A but fall into the same ranking order when different species of natural DNA are compared.
TI  - Flow dichroism evidence for tilting of the bases when DNA is in solution.
AB  - Flow linear dichroism studies of DNAs from Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus are extended into the vacuum UV region to 175 nm. The short-wavelength pi pi region shows a less negative reduced linear dichroism than the well-studied long-wavelength pi pi region. These results are independent of the type of DNA and the concentration of salt over the range 0.001 to 1.0 M. This proves that the bases are not perpendicular to the flow orientation. Assuming that the DNA tends to align along its helix axis, the largest angle that the bases can make with the helix axis is 73 +/- 3 degrees.
TI  - Bacteria in enteric lesions of cattle.
AB  - Thirty-nine species of bacteria were isolated from or demonstrated in the abomasal and small and large intestinal mucosa of 23 adult cattle and 41 calves and identified. The bacteria isolated were related to the gross and microscopical lesions. Campylobacters, Clostridium perfringens type A, C sordellii, Actinobacillus lignieresii, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, Aeromonas hydrophila and Escherichia coli were all associated with specific lesions. The relationship of other bacteria such as Bacillus licheniformis, Branhamella catarrhalis and Bacteroides vulgatus to lesions in which they were found was discussed. It was concluded that some of the bacteria could be responsible for the lesions in which they were found. However, proof of this supposition could only be obtained by experimental infections of non-immune cattle with pure cultures.
TI  - Neonatal diarrhea of pigs in Quebec: infectious causes of significant outbreaks.
AB  - To evaluate the relative importance of the various enteropathogens causing neonatal diarrhea in Quebec farrowing operations, observations were made on 749 diarrheic pigs from 325 outbreaks of diarrhea. They were one to 15 days of age, and were obtained alive for necropsy generally within 48 hours of the onset of diarrhea. Some pigs were from severe, explosive outbreaks of diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality rates, while others were from herds with chronic neonatal diarrhea with lower morbidity and mortality rates. A combination of bacteriological, virological and histological methods were used to study the pigs. Viruses were incriminated in 60%, bacteria in 23% and coccidia in 15.3% of the 325 diarrhea outbreaks. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was by far the most common enteropathogen with a prevalence of 52%; rotavirus was implicated in 9.2% of the outbreaks while adenovirus was incriminated in 0.30% of the outbreaks. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were involved in 22.4% of the cases while Clostridium perfringens type C was an occasional finding. Coccidia involved in our herds were identified as Isospora suis. The disease was attributed to infection with a single etiologic agent in 590 diarrheic pigs (78%) while combinations of agents were present in only 90 (12%). The age-specific occurrence of the various enteropathogens was evaluated. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was the most common enteropathogen in all age groups. Colibacillosis was common in pigs which became diarrheic under five days of age; in this age group, the enterotoxigenic E. coli were frequently found alone, but were usually combined with other agents in older pigs. The prevalence of coccidia was high in pigs which became diarrheic between five and 15 days of age. Rotavirus infection was common in diarrheic pigs older than ten days of age. Although individual baby pigs were commonly infected with a single enteropathogen, it was very common to see more than one agent involved in an outbreak of diarrhea, particularly when pigs of different ages were affected. Observations on the occurrence of the enteropathogens according to the seasons were also made. Occurrence of transmissible gastroenteritis was throughout the year with the highest prevalence during the fall, winter and spring months. Colibacillosis and coccidiosis were more common in the summer, fall and early winter months with the lowest prevalence in the spring months.
TI  - Development of gut colonisation in pre-term neonates.
AB  - Twenty-eight pre-term babies of low birth weight were monitored for developing microflora in throat, stomach and faeces during the first 3 weeks of life. The flora at all levels of the gastrointestinal tract differed from that of healthy breast-fed and artificially fed full-term babies. Colonisation of throat and stomach was delayed beyond 4 days of life in 87% and 60% of babies respectively. Only 10% of babies had "normal" oral flora throughout the period of study. Flora of the stomach was sparse, and resembled faecal flora. Faecal flora was established more rapidly than throat or stomach flora, and 70% of babies were colonised during the first 4 days of life. Initially Bacteroides spp. were predominant (57% babies), but Escherichia coli and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli gradually increased in frequency. Colonisation by gram-positive bacteria was slow. Clostridium spp. were present in only 10% of babies during the first 4 days of life. Most strains were transient. Colonisation with C. butyricum (30%), C. perfringens (35%) and C. difficile (25%) was maximum after the first 2 weeks of life. Lactic-acid-producing bacteria usually appeared late in the third week of life. Parenteral feeding immediately after birth was associated with delayed colonisation by a restricted number of species. Parenteral antibiotics (penicillin or gentamicin or both) restricted colonisation with normal oral flora, the lactic-acid-producing bacteria and penicillin-sensitive clostridia, but had little effect on E. coli even when the colonising strain was sensitive to the aminoglycoside in the regimen. Systemic spread of bacteria via the blood stream was not detected in any babies. The pattern of colonisation of the enteric tract in pre-term infants in the special-care nursery studied, differs from that of healthy full-term babies; this merits consideration when the results of bacteriological tests of this vulnerable group of infants are being interpreted.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.

TI  - A comparison of the levels of faecal indicator bacteria in water and human faeces in a rural area of a tropical developing country (Sierra Leone).
AB  - The levels of faecal coliforms (FC), indole-positive FC (presumptive Escherichia  coli), faecal streptococci (FS), Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens in the natural water sources used by 29 rural settlements in Sierra Leone were investigated. Levels of the same indicators in human faeces were also investigated. The incidence of Salmonella spp. in both habitats and the temperature, pH and conductivity of water sources were also recorded. All water sources were contaminated with the indicator bacteria, mean numbers of which occurred in the relationship FC greater than presumptive E. coli congruent to FS congruent to C. perfringens greater than S. faecalis. FC were also predominant in human faeces, the relationship of means being FC congruent to presumptive E. coli greater than FS greater S. faecalis greater than C. perfringens. The need for confirmation of FC counts obtained from water sources was indicated by the large number of positive tubes produced in the FC multiple-tube dilution test from some samples which could not be confirmed as presumptive E. coli. Salmonella spp. Were isolated from 13 water sources and 6% of faecal samples. Mean water temperature was high (26.2 degrees C), pH low (5.04) and conductivity low (34 microS cm-1). Presumptive E. coli was considered the most appropriate indicator of faecal pollution of the types of water investigated.

TI  - [Antagonistic effect against "Clostridium perfringens" exerted in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice by "Clostridium" strains isolated from the microflora of conventional mice (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacterial strains isolated from the digestive tract of conventional mice produced a barrier effect against a strain of Clostridium perfringens type A (strain CP) in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice. This barrier effect was observed when mice, monoassociated with Escherichia coli K12, were inoculated with a mixed culture of fusiform-shaped clostridia. The collection of fusiforms (collection D) was obtained from a single colony chosen from among the 26 types studied. Collection D and E. coli K12 together exerted a barrier effect against all strains of C. perfringens type A tested. No effect was observed against a C. perfringens type C strain. The expression of the barrier effect depended on the order in which the strains were used to inoculate the mice. Thus strain CP was eliminated from the digestive tract when the mice had previously been associated with collection D and E. coli K12. If the mice were inoculated with strain CP first, however, the barrier effect was only partial. We have also been able to use two strains of clostridia (C1, C3) instead of E. coli K12 to produce a drastic barrier effect against strain CP. The order in which the strains were used to inoculate the mice did not, in this case, influence the production of a barrier effect. Three strains (Da, Db, Dc) isolated from collection D, produced only a partial barrier effect against strain CP in mice previously associated with E. coli K12. These results illustrate the difficulties encountered in determining the minimal number of bacterial strains involved in the production of a barrier effect.

TI  - The bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  - The development of the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities  of the gastro-intestinal tract was studied in 31 infants during the first 10 days of life. Specimens were collected from the umbilicus, mouth and gastro-intestinal tract on the pre-operative day, at operation and on post-operative days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Bacteria were isolated semi-quantitatively on a variety of plain and selective media and identified by conventional methods.Staphylococcus albus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was recovered from 24 of the 31 babies. The viridans group of streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius were the commonest species isolated from the mouth; there were no differences between the babies with different abnormalities and treatment with antibiotics had no effect on the bacterial flora. Ten babies were colonized by each species on the pre-operative day, and 25 and 19 respectively by the tenth post-operative day. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant oral anaerobes. Bacteria were not isolated from the rectal swabs of babies with tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) or small bowel atresia on the pre-operative days. Post-operatively the predominant faecal isolates from babies with TOF were Str. faecalis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. About 80% of the babies with small bowel atresia were colonized by Str. faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus, 60% each by E. coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Str. faecium. The five babies with necrotizing enterocolitis were colonized by Str. faecalis, E. coli, Cl. perfringens and Cl. difficile; Bacteroides spp. were not recovered from any of them. The commonest facultative species recovered from babies with large bowel obstruction were Str. faecalis and E. coli. B. vulgatus, Cl. perfringens and Bifidobacterium spp. were the commonest anaerobes and anaerobes outnumbered aerobes. No significant isolates were recovered from the wound swabs and none of the babies developed post-surgical sepsis.

TI  - Microbiological studies on hamburgers.
AB  - One hundred and eighty-two raw, 112 pre-cooked and 750 cooked hamburgers composed mainly of beef or beef and pork were subjected to microbiological examination.Raw hamburgers gave total bacterial counts from 10(6) to 10(8) per g, counts of Enterobacteriaceae from 10(4) to 10(6) per g, of Escherichia coli from 10(3) to 10(5), of group D streptococci from 10(2) to 10(4), of Staphylococcus aureus from 3 to 10(2) and of Clostridium perfringens less than 10 bacteria per g. Of the samples, 32% contained salmonellas; the highest most probable number was 10(2) per g but most estimates were below 1 per g. Corresponding figures for the pre-cooked samples were 2-3 log cycles lower, and only one sample contained salmonella. Yersinia enterocolitica was not isolated from any raw or pre-cooked sample.Three hundred and ninety-five of the cooked hamburgers were prepared by grilling raw hamburgers for between 2 and 5.5 min. These gave total bacterial counts from 10(5) to 10(7) per g, and counts of Enterobacteriaceae from 10(2) to 10(5) per g. Of the samples, 9.4% contained salmonellas, always in numbers below 1 per g. The remaining 355 cooked hamburgers were prepared from samples pre-cooked for 10 min at 80 degrees C. Some were grilled and some fat fried. The total bacterial counts were from 10(3) to 10(5) per g, and counts of Enterobacteriaceae below 10(2) per g. Salmonellae, again in small numbers only, were recovered from 3.5% of samples.When hamburgers were artificially contaminated with Salmonella typhimurium it took 5.5 min on a commercial grill, 2.25 min frying in a frying pan and 1.75 min on a household grill to reliably reduce the salmonella count one hundredfold. This means that at many vending places hamburgers are often cooked for too short a time.D-values were determined for S. typhimurium in hamburger meat at 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 degrees C, these values were 7.1, 5.1, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 min respectively. It can be concluded that the heating action in the centre of the hamburgers will take place more slowly than in the hamburger as a whole, and that the time between cooking and consumption is very important in reducing the microbial load to acceptable levels.Pre-cooking (10 min at 80 degrees C in a water bath) gives a reduction in the numbers of salmonella of about 4 x 10(3), after which cooking gives a further reduction as mentioned above.
TI  - Polymicrobial septicemia associated with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure.
AB  - Myoglobinuria and renal failure resulting from bacterial infection have only rarely been reported. To our knowledge, we describe the first reported case of polymicrobial septicemia resulting in rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric renal failure. Renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria has an excellent prognosis; in our patient, recovery was complete. The frequency of rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and renal failure in septicemia is unknown and can only be determined by an increased awareness of this potential complication of septicemia.
TI  - Bacteriologic examination of equine fecal flora as a diagnostic tool for equine intestinal clostridiosis.
AB  - The fecal flora of 56 clinically healthy and 23 sick horses were examined bacteriologically for counts of Clostridium perfringens, molds, coliforms, alpha- and beta-hemolytic streptococci, and microbes belonging to genus Bacillus, as well as for the presence of Salmonella spp. Of the healthy horses, 85.7% had a C perfringens count less than 10(1) colony-forming units/g of feces. Of the healthy horses, lowest counts were found in race-horses. Of the sick horses, equine intestinal clostridiosis was diagnosed in 2 horses with large C perfringens counts (10(4) to 10(7) colony-forming units/g) and with acute diarrhea. The 7 isolates of C perfringens were identified as serotype A. Salmonella spp were not detected from any of the horses. The study indicated that diagnosing equine intestinal clostridiosis based on the determination of the fecal C perfringens count was suitable.
TI  - [Study of the microbial multiplication in the muscle just after slaughter (author's transl)].
AB  - The bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the serum, the muscle and the rabbit meat juice was followed after slaughter on animals vaccinated or not against E. coli, P. putida, Cl. perfringens. Rabbit serum is bactericidal against gram negative bacteria, P. putida and E. coli. On the contrary it is without effect on Cl. perfringens. Muscle has no inhibitory effect against E. coli and Cl. perfringens on animals vaccinated or not. P. putida is inhibited or partially eliminated from rabbit muscle just after slaughter. Vaccination does not increase the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activities of the sera, the meat juices and intact muscles.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis of the aged.
AB  - Bacteriological examination was performed on bile from 23 patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis. Of 23 bile cultures, 15 yielded aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and 8 yielded aerobic bacteria only. No specimen grew anaerobic bacteria only. A total of 20 cultures yielded a polymicrobial flora, and 3 cultures grew one single aerobic bacterium. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., enterococci, Bacteroids fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens were the predominant bacterial flora in bile of these patients. Bacteremia was documented in 10 of the 12 patients cultured. All bacteremias involved aerobic bacteria and were polymicrobial in three patients. The frequent presence of anaerobes in bile of patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis suggests that antimicrobial therapy should provide adequate coverage for anaerobic bacteria and enteric organisms.
TI  - [Comparison of antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime with other cephalosporins against clinically isolated bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activity of MX in comparison with those of other CEPs, using aerobic Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. Against Streptococcus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM and CTM. Against H. influenzae, CMX also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMX, CXM, CTM and CEZ. ABPC-and PIPC-resistant strains were sensitive to CMX. CTX, CPZ and CZX also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of CMX. Against enteric bacteria, E. coli, Klebsiella, E. cloacae, Serratia, C. freundii and Proteus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM, CTM and CEZ. Especially, against E. coli, Klebsiella, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity. As to non-fermentation bacteria, CMX's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except P. putrefaciens, Alcaligenes and Comamonas. However, it was superior than that of CEZ. In comparison with other CEPs, the strength of CMX varied according to the kinds of bacteria. As to anaerobic bacteria, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, C. perfringens, Veillonella and Fusobacterium. However, its antibacterial activity against Bacteroides was similar to those of other CEPs.
TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.

The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.

AB  - In Austria there exist no regulations for the quality of peats and sludges of lakes for the external usage in balneotherapy. The results of our examinations showed that peats on the whole (Fig. 1) have much better bacteriological results than sludges of shallow, eutrophic lakes (Fig. 2). Typical intestinal germs appeared only in one of the five examined peats during a rain period down to 0.6 m beneath the surface. Three of the peats showed satisfying local and bacteriological conditions, one of the peats had a critical hygienic topography and high bacterial counts were found. The outcome of the bacteriological examinations of the three sludge-samples of two lakes showed quite a worse result. High levels of intestinal bacteria, E. coli, Enterococci, C. perfringens, were detectable. The averages of the bacterial counts of the peats and the sludges of lakes over the whole drilling length shows Fig. 3. The results of our examinations demonstrate that in most cases peats far away from human settlements may be used under appropriate conditions. To the contrary sludges of shallow, eutrophic lakes are not usable for balneological therapy because of the massive contamination with intestinal germs. There obviously is a danger for the patients to catch an illness when being treated with such sludges. Criteria for the bacteriological status of peloids are set up for discussion and the minimal quality demanded is that 1 g of peloid has to be free of intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Some aspects of microbial contamination of hands of workers in food industries.
AB  - With regard to food hygiene, the question is posed whether carriers of pathogenic organisms, like Salmonella can contaminate a product by their hands. This might especially be possible in case of bad toilet hygiene. Experiments were carried out in 13 food and 3 non-food establishments. An inquiry was made into habits of toilet use and hand washing. The following microbiological examinations were performed on workers' hands: total colony-forming-units per hand, and the presence of Salmonella, E. coli, Enterobact., Staph. aureus, faecal Streptococci and Cl. perfringens. Approximately 42% of workers in the food industry and approximately 64% of workers in other industries seems to use the factory toilet regularly for defaecation. Because of the presence of contaminated raw materials in food industries, it is impossible to get direct proof that faecal contamination of the hands is due to toilet use. However, there is indirect evidence that contamination of workers' hands by raw materials, especially of animal origin, is of much more importance than the consequences of toilet use. This is shown by the occurrence of Salmonella on the hands (5-36% pos.) in only those factories where raw materials of animal origin are handled, by the low incidence of E. coli on the hands in food industries where "clean" materials (vegetables, biscuits, chocolate) are handled, and by the total absence of E. coli on the hands of workers in two non-food industries.
TI  - Behavior of pathogenic bacteria in the oyster, Crassostrea commercialis, during depuration, re-laying, and storage.
AB  - Oysters (Crassostrea commercials) harvested from major cultivation areas within the state of New South Wales, Australia, were commonly contaminated with low levels of the food-poisoning organisms Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Salmonella was found in oysters on only one occasion. These bacteria were cleansed from oysters during oyster purification by re-laying in a non-polluted waterway. Oysters were laboratory contaminated to levels in excess 1,000 cells per g with either B. cereus, C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus, Salmonella typhimurium, or S. senftenberg. These species were cleansed from such oysters during purification in a laboratory depuration unit that used ultraviolet light for sterilizing the depuration water. Escherichia coli was also cleansed from oysters under the same re-laying or depuration conditions so that its measurement alone could be used to indicate the cleansing of the above pathogenic species. The levels of these bacteria were also measured during the storage of oysters under conditions that occur during marketing. While B. cereus counts remained relatively stable during storage, the Salmonella spp. gradually decreased in numbers and C. perfringens rapidly died off. V. parahaemolyticus counts increased slightly during the first 4 days of storage, after which decreases occurred.

The total viable count (37 and 20 degrees C), numbers of Enterobacteriaceae (37 and 17 degrees C), and presumptive coliforms did not differ significantly between shop type or season. Statistically significant differences in numbers of faecal Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens were too small to be of commercial importance, or diagnostic value.
TI  - Relationship between metronidazole metabolism and bactericidal activity.
AB  - It has been suggested that the microbicidal effect of metronidazole is mediated by an intermediate in nitro group reduction. We have found that the addition of Escherichia coli enhances the lethal effect of metronidazole on Bacillus fragilis and suggest that this intermediate may form in one bacteria and kill another. Because acetamide forms during the reduction of metronidazole, we examined the possibility that the same partially reduced intermediate in metronidazole reduction may be both an intermediate in the formation of acetamide and the ultimate reactive form of metronidazole which is responsible for its bactericidal action. Thus, we determined the relationship between bacterial survival and the formation of acetamide when cultures of B. fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and E. coli were incubated anaerobically in the presence of metronidazole. We found that the log of the early bacterial survival was proportional to the formation of acetamide. The rate of loss of metronidazole was not dependent on the concentration of bacteria in the medium, suggesting that any proposed intermediate formed at a rate which was proportional only to the concentration of metronidazole.
TI  - K-1 antigen content and the presence of an additional sialic acid-containing antigen among bacteremic K-1 Escherichia coli: correlation with susceptibility to opsonophagocytosis.
AB  - Eighty percent of blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli K-1 are resistant to in vitro opsonophagocytosis by normal human granulocytes and fresh serum. To determine the basis for susceptibility to phagocytosis in 20% of bacteremic K-1 E. coli, we investigated possible quantitative and qualitative immunochemical differences in the K-1 antigen content among resistant and sensitive isolates. We prepared extracts of blood culture K-1 E. coli by sonication and determined the K-1 polysaccharide content per dry weight of bacteria by rocket immunoelectrophoresis using cross-reactive equine anti-group B meningococcal sera. We assessed qualitative differences in the antigen content by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, using an immune globulin fraction and isolated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM from the group B antisera. Three different resistant K-1 isolates contained a mean K-1 content of 48.5 +/- 7.6 mug/mg +/- standard deviation of dry bacteria, and three sensitive isolates contained 23.2 +/- 5.6 mug/mg (P < 0.005). Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of extracts from both sensitive and resistant strains revealed a secondary sialic acid-containing antigen that was electrophoretically different from both the major K-1 antigen and a reference group B meningococcal antigen. This negatively charged secondary antigen was susceptible to Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase degradation and reacted only with IgG whereas the major K-1 antigen reacted only with IgM. This antigen was detected in the extracts of resistant isolates only at 10(10) but not at 10(9) colony-forming units per milliliter. This study demonstrates that (i) the degree of phagocytosis of bacteremic E. coli K-1 isolates is inversely associated with K-1 content, and (ii) more easily phagocytosed (sensitive) K-1 isolates have greater amounts of an additional sialic acid-containing antigen that appears to be unrelated to the previously described O acetyl K-1 antigen.
TI  - The control of bacterial contamination in carcass meal with propionic acid.
AB  - The effect of the addition of 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10% respectively of propionic acid on known numbers of bacteria added to or contained in carcass meal was examined. Escherichia coli was totally inhibited by 2% propionic acid, while 5% of the acid both inhibited Salmonella typhimurium and brought about a 74,7% reduction in the total aerobic bacterial count.
TI  - Comparison of methods available for assay of chloramphenicol in clinical specimens.
AB  - Eight methods for the assay of chloramphenicol in clinical samples were compared  with our own modification of a plate diffusion technique using Sarcina lutea and yeast extract agar. Six of the eight methods were less sensitive than originally reported, and five of them were considered unsuitable for use in clinical microbiology practice. The remaining three methods together with the S. lutea/yeast extract modification were used to assay chloramphenicol in 20 samples of serum. Twenty samples of cerebrospinal fluid were also assayed by the S. lutea/yeast extract method. Our results indicate that only the Bacillus subtilis (sensitivity 6x0 mg/l) and the S. lutea (sensitivity 2x5 mg/l) diffusion methods are suitable for use with clinical samples in routine practice. The problems of chloramphenicol toxicity, appropriate dosage regimens, and the need for assay of the drugs are considered.
TI  - Photo-oxidation of L-glutamate decarboxylase from Escherichia coli, sensitized by the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate and by proflavin.
AB  - Irradiation of L-glutamate decarboxylase (L-glutamate 1-carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.15) from Escherichia coli by visible light absorbed by the intrinsic chromophore, pyridoxal phosphate, caused the selective modification of two methionines per enzyme monomer. The disulfoxide derivative exhibited modified circular dichroism, chromatographic and kinetic properties, suggesting a conformational role for the two methionine residues. Irradiation of the enzyme in the presence of proflavin revealed the presence of two distinct groups of tryptophan residues with markedly different photooxidation rate constants. No evidence of involvement of tryptophans in the catalytic mechanisms of the enzyme was obtained. The results are compared with those obtained on irradiation of L-glutamate decarboxylase from Clostridium perfringens.

TI  - Commercial milk products and indigenous weaning foods in a rural West African Environment: a bacteriological perspective.
AB  - Two commercially available baby milks, one 'biologically acidified', the other 'non-acidified', and a traditional weaning food, millet gruel, were prepared and stored under village conditions in West Africa. Increases in total colony count and in number of Bacillus cereus, Clostridium welchii, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were determined in these products when stored as commonly practised at ambient temperatures over a period of 8 h. Poor hygiene during preparation was indicated by readily detectable numbers of coliforms and E. coli in freshly prepared samples of each of the milks, though the cooked local gruel seemed less vulnerable in this respect. The rate of increase in the numbers of these organisms was lower in the acidified milk when prepared with unboiled water containing high numbers of coliforms and E. coli. Increases in total colony count and in numbers of Staph. aureus were also less marked in the acidified milk. When food was not eaten soon after preparation the problem of bacterial overgrowth was as great with the local gruel as with the considerably more nutritious reconstituted milks.
TI  - Relationships between environmental factors, bacterial indicators, and the occurrence of enteric viruses in estuarine sediments.
AB  - Current standards for evaluation of the public health safety of recreational and  shellfish-harvesting waters are based upon bacteriological analysis, but do not include an evaluation of the number of viruses. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of enteric viruses in estuarine sediments and to find a relationship, if any, between the presence of viruses in seawater or sediment or both and various biological and physicochemical characteristics of the environment. Viruses were found in greater numbers in sediment than in overlying seawater on a volume basis. Several types of enteroviruses were isolated: coxsackievirus types A16, B1, and B5, echovirus type 1, and poliovirus type 2. On several occasions, viruses were isolated from sediments when overlying seawaters met bacteriological water quality standards for recreational use. Statistical analysis of the relationship between viruses in seawater or in sediment and other variables measured yielded only one significant association: the number of viruses in sediment was found to be positively correlated with the number of fecal coliforms in sediment. No other physical, chemical, or biological characteristic of seawater or sediment that was measured showed statistically significant association with viral numbers. No correlation was found between bacterial indicators and virus in the overlying waters. The data indicated that evaluation of the presence of bacteria and viruses in sediment may provide additional insight into long-term water quality conditions and that indicator bacteria in water are not reflective of the concentration of enteric viruses in marine waters.
TI  - [Problems of maintaining hygienic and microbiological quality standards in the production of foodstuffs, particularly those of vegetable origin. Second report: Demands regarding hygiene and microbiology-theory is useless without practice (author's transl)].
AB  - Many legal regulations exist on the hygienic-microbiological properties of food products. The 'Lander-Speiseeisverordnungen' (County Ice Cream Regulations), the 'Diat-Verordnung' (Dietary Regulation) and the 'Trinkwasser-Verordnung' (Regulation on Potable Water) are examples for the frequent inadequacies inherent in these regulations. Caution is indicated against any new proposals for the establishment of additional hygienic-microbiological regulations without sufficient practice-related reasoning unless a revision and improvement of inadequate, already existing regulations has been carried out. Practicable procedures have to be prepared not only to maintain the hygiene in Catering facilities, but also for the evaluation of food products and raw materials according to hygienic-microbiological criteria: Although commonly assumed, the 'Microbe Counts' alone are not sufficient for the determination of the hygienic conditions. Therefore, inspite of all the weak points inherent in quality control procedures - e. g. possible sick, co-workers, only random sample control of raw material supplies - such adapted systems (good manufacturing practice) have to be enforced with special emphasis on the economy of the control expenditure, interdisciplinary aspects, governmental control and consumer information. Examples from literature and own experience demonstrate that the importance of the 'Fecal Indicators' for the judgement of 'hygienic conditions' in food production are rather limited and a correct evaluation only by 'Bacterial Plate Counts' is not possible due to the variation of germ density within one sample. Microbiological investigations of food products according to statistic rules require such an expenditure that they cannot generally be used as routine control procedures. A possible documentation is shown which allows - even without statistic investigations, at least retrospectively - the preparation of a survey on the microbiological properties of raw materials generally available on the market and which makes it possible to recognize and reject any unqualified microbiological limiting value requirements.

TI  - [Interest in gnotoxenic systems for the study of host-microbial flora of the digestive tract].
AB  - It is necessary to use experimental models in all studies of interactions between a host, its digestive tract microbial flora and the environment because these interactions are complex. The gnotoxenic animal, reared in an isolator as the axenic animal and harbouring a known microbial flora, constitutes either an analytic or mimetic experimental model. The gnotoxenic animal may be considered as an analytic model when used to determine which biotic or abiotic environmental factor of the host-animal plays a role in the intestinal ecosystem. The potential metabolic or immunologic role of a given bacterial strain in the intestinal ecosystem may be determined when the axenic animal is associated with this strain. The variation of the expression of the potential role of this strain in relation to the environment can be ascertained by diversifying the diet of the host or by introducing other bacterial strains into the intestinal ecosystem. The role of an association of strains in host physiology and host protection against potentially pathogenic target strains can also be studied using this analytic model. An analytic model is created by associating either isolated strains of the holoxenic or heated or diluted suspensions of holoxenic digestive tract flora. Axenic mice associated with these simplified flora are called meroxenic. The gnotoxenic animal is considered to be a mimetic model when it harbours a microbial flora isolated from an animal of a different species. The advantage of the mimetic model is that it provides an easy-to-use biological tool, i.e. gnotoxenic mice, to first determine the potential role of these microbial strains. The validity of the mimetic model is then tested by comparing gnotoxenic mice and gnotoxenic piglets or chickens. When all the gnotoxenic animals are given the same diet, this comparison permits an estimation of the animal-host role in the expression of the potential activities of microbial strains. The mimetic model, composed of gnotoxenic animals harbouring microbial strains of human origin, is the only experimental model which can be used to study the role of microorganisms in the intestinal ecosystem of man.

AB  - Problems are still encountered in the performance and interpretation of tests of  anaerobe sensitivity to antibiotics. A review of the methods currently used was carried out in order to determine factors modifying the activity of antibiotics. The sensitivity of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens to various drugs was tested under different conditions (including different culture media and incubation atmospheres). Gentamicin and kanamycin showed no activity in tests with brain heart infusion agar incubated anaerobically or in 10% CO2. The activity of lincomycin was much more readily influenced by test conditions than that of clindamycin. All the drugs examined except gentamicin and kanamycin showed more activity when tested in brain heart infusion agar than in Mueller Hinton blood agar.

TI  - Binding of platinum(II) intercalation reagents to deoxyribnonucleic acid. Dependence on base-pair composition, nature of the intercalator, and ionic strength.
AB  - The DNA binding of three platinum(II) intercalation reagents has been studied and found to depend upon base composition, the nature of the intercalator, and the ionic strength of the solvent medium. In 0.2 M NaCl, binding data for calf thymus DNA show the association constants to be approximately 10(4) M-1. The binding constants decrease in the order [(o-phen)Pt(en)]2+ greater than or equal to [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ greater than [(bipy)Pt(en)]2+. The number of available intercalation sites for the doubly charged intercalators is only 70% of the number expected from the nearest-neighbor exclusion model. Binding of [(o-phen)Pt(en)]2+ and [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ to various DNAs depends linearly on G.C content. Both reagents exhibit essentially the same degree of G.C specificity. Intercalative binding is a function of ionic strength. Increasing the salt concentration minimizes the importance of metallointercalator charge, and extrapolation to 1 M salt reveals the intercalative abilities, as reflected in binding constants, to be equivalent for [(terpy)Pt(HET)]+ and [o-phen)Pt(en)]2+ and about 1 order of magnitude less than that of ethidium.
TI  - Effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic C3H/He  male mice.
AB  - The effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium indolis, C. paraputrificum, C. perfringens, C. innocuum, C. nexile, C. ramosum, C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides multiacidus, Bacteroides fragilis, Veillonella alcalescens, V. parvula, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). The average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, and C. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). In contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, L. acidophilus, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from that in germfree animals (0.5). The present study demonstrated that the presence of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
TI  - Microbiology of bruised tissue.

This suggests that there is no good reason for the condemnation of bruised tissue, which could well be used in manufactured products.
TI  - Role of bacterial growth rates in the epidemiology and pathogenesis of urinary infections in women.
AB  - The mean minimum generation time in shake culture in urine of 6 urinary isolates  of Escherichia coli (21.7 +/- 0.6 min) was significantly shorter (P = 0.0003) than that of 14 isolates of less common urinary pathogens (46.0 +/- 18.6 min). Mixed populations of approximately equal numbers of E. coli cells paired with other urinary, fecal, and urethral organisms were introduced into a laboratory model of the lower human urinary tract. This model used urine as a medium and reproduced some features of the balance between bacterial growth and the flushing effect of urine. After 24 h E. coli formed greater than or equal to 99% of the bacterial population in the bladder model for 16 our of 18 pairs of isolates examined. Relatively high oxygen tensions in urine sample from 18 healthy women (10.9 +/- 22. kPA) and 18 infected patients (8.0 +/- 4.3 kPa) may explain why anaerobic urinary infections are uncommon. The rapid growth rate of E. coli may be one explanation why it is the commonest cause of urinary infection even though it is relatively uncommon at the urethral meatus.
TI  - Effect of sample transport systems on survival of bacteria in ground beef.
AB  - The effects of two transport systems and cryoprotective agents on the survival of bacteria in ground beef samples were evaluated. Survival of Clostridium perfringens in ground beef samples after simulated transport (72 h) was higher (about 99%) in Dry Ice than in Trans Temp shipping units (-3 degrees C). There were no significant differences between the two transport systems in survival of coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or aerobic bacteria. Mixing ground beef samples at a ratio of 1:1 (wt/vol) with 10, 20, or 30% buffered solutions of dimethyl sulfoxide or glycerol before freezing improved the survival of C. perfringens and coliforms in both transport systems. Recovery of E. coli was significantly higher with the addition of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide before Dry Ice transport. Addition of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide resulted in a 100% recovery of both S. aureus and aerobic bacteria from ground beef after simulated transport in Trans Temp shipping units. The use of cryoprotective agents can improve the survival of bacteria during transport of ground beef samples.
TI  - Effect of O-sulphate groups in lactose and N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose on their enzymic hydrolysis.
AB  - 1. Lactose 6'-O-sulphate, N-acetylneuraminyl-(alpha 2 leads to 3)-D-lactose 6'-O-sulphate, N-acetylneuraminyl ?-O-sulphate-(alpha 2 leads to 3)-D-lactose 6'0-O-sulphate, N-acetylneuraminyl ?-O-sulphate-(alpha 2 leads to 6)-D-lactose and N-acetylneuraminyl-(alpha 2 leads to 3)- and -(alpha 2 leads to 6))-lactose 6'-O-sulphate were prepared by chemical sulphation of lactose, N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose and tis isomers by using pyridine-SO3 reagent. 2. Significant kinetic differences were observed in the enzymic hydrolysis of the sulphated derivatives compared with unsubstituted substrates. 3. In the case of reactions catalysed by rat liver lysosomal and Clostridium perfringens neuraminidases (EC 3.2.1.18), the presence of an O-sulphate group in the N-acetylneuraminyl moiety affected the reaction by decreasing the Km and the Vmax, its presence in the galactosyl moiety affected the reaction by decreasing the Km and increasing the Vmax. and its presence in both N-acetylneuraminyl and galactosyl moieties decreased the Km and the Vmax. of the reaction. 4. Mixed-substrate reaction kinetic data indicated competition between the sulphated and unsubstituted substrates for the same active sites on the neuraminidase molecule. 5. Lactose 6'-O-sulphate neither behaved as a substrate nor acted as an inhibitor with respect to unsubstituted lactose and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside when tested with lactase of suckling rat intestine and Escherichia coli beta-D-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23). 6. Preliminary investigation also indicated that, whereas glucose 6-O-sulphate and glucose 3-O-sulphate were were neither substrate nor inhibitor of glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4), galactose 6-O-sulphate was oxidized half as fast as unsubstituted galactose by galactose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.48).

AB  - Antisecretory component, anti-alpha, anti-mu and anti-Fc (gamma) fluorescent antibodies were used to detect the presence of immunoglobulins with antibody activity against enteric commensal bacteria in human colostrum and serum. Forty nine colostrum samples were studied; all of them displayed secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies reacting with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli serotype O141:H32 without any K antigen. The amount of sIgA antibodies was always related to the sIgA colostral concentration varying greatly from one patient to another. For the 3 lactating women studied, the colostrum sIgA antibodies were largely predominant as compared to the antibodies of other classes; in their sera, no antibody having the same anticommensal specificity was detected in the IgA fraction while these antibodies were found in IgM and IgG. Our results are incompatible with the existence of local antigenic stimulation, and the IgA transfer from serum into mammary secretion appears unlikely, but these results are perfectly compatible with the antigenic stimulation of gut associated lymphoid tissue and subsequent migration in mammary tissue.

TI  - Intestinal strangulation in germfree and monocontaminated dogs.
AB  - Earlier studies in the germfree rat demonstrated that the common intestinal bacteria vary greatly in their ability to cause death after intestinal strangulation. Some of these experiments were repeated in adult, germfree and monocontaminated beagles. Neither short closed-loop hemorrhagic nor long closed-loop ischemic strangulation killed the germfree dog. Either procedure rapidly killed the dog with a conventional bacterial flora or a dog monocontaminated with Clostridium perfringens. The dogs monocontaminated with Bacteroides fragilis died after several days, whereas Escherichia coli killed only one of three animals. These experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the germfree dog as a unique research subject, confirm our earlier studies on intestinal strangulation in germfree rats, and further emphasize the differing lethal potentials of the intestinal bacteria in intestinal strangulation.
TI  - Experimental animal models for anaerobic infections.
AB  - An experimental animal model that stimulates the mixed aerobic-anaerobic microflora of intraabdominal sepsis was used to study antimicrobial efficacy in vivo. Treatment of infected rats with chloramphenicol resulted in only a modest reduction in the percentage of animals surviving infection with abscesses at necropsy. This unanticipated observation led to further exploration of the predominant anaerobes associated with the experimental infection. In vitro cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, susceptible to chloramphenicol in traditional tests, were capable of reducing chloramphenicol to its aryl amine derivative, which is biologically inactive. In contrast, metronidazole, an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, reduced the coli-metronidazole, an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, reduced the coli-form-associated mortality in this animal model. Subsequent studies showed that this reduction in mortality is dependent on the presence of an anaerobe and that the levels of Escherichia coli in mixed continuous culture with B. fragilis are reduced by addition of metronidazole. This reduction following addition of metronidazole was not observed either in a pure culture of E. coli or when clindamycin was added to a mixed culture. In a modification of the previously described model, infective material was placed subcutaneously into Wistar rats. Studies with this model suggested that the host's response to bacterial challenge is dependent on the site of infection and that organotropism of the implanted bacterial species is an important determinant of infection.
TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

TI  - Microbiological aspects of polyphosphate injection in the processing and chill storage of poultry.
AB  - During commercial processing of broiler chickens, injection of polyphosphate (Puron 604 or 6040) resulted in microorganisms being added to the deep breast muscle. The level of contamination was related to the microbiological condition of the injection solution. Injection of polyphosphate had no effect on the shelf-life of fresh chilled carcasses held at 1 degree of 10 degrees C but changes were observed in the growth rate of microorganisms in the deep muscle and in the composition of the muscle microflora following storage. Cross-contamination of carcasses and the transfer of organisms from the skin to the deep muscle during injection was demonstrated with a marker strain of Clostridium perfringens. However, both processes were influenced by the number of marker organisms applied initially to the skin. The above findings are discussed in relation to the possible behaviour of any food poisoning bacteria present.
TI  - The effects of temperature and ethidium bromide on the banding of heat-denatured  DNA in gradients of NaI.
AB  - The effects of temperature and ethidium bromide on the banding of heat-denatured  DNA was studied during equilibrium centrifugation in density gradients of NaI. Centrifugation at 10 degrees C prevents the partial renaturation of Escherichia coli DNA and Clostridium perfringens DNA that occurs at 20 degrees C. A centrifugation temperature of --5 degrees C is required to prevent renaturation of T7 phage DNA. Ethidium bromide decreases renaturation of Escherichia coli DNA during centrifugation at 20 degrees C and causes a small shift in the buoyant density of both denatured and native DNA. Equilibrium centrifugation at lower temperatures prevents DNA renaturation and permits increased utilization of the large buoyant density difference between native and heat-denatured DNA in gradients of NaI.
TI  - [First steps in the bacterial colonization of the digestive tract of neonates (author's transl)].
AB  - Meconium samples obtained from 14 children aged 18 to 51 h were subjected to a quantitative differential analysis. The meconium of one of the children (47 h old) was sterile; in those of the 11 infants aged less than 47 h the dominant flora was composed of either enterobacteria, mainly Escherichia coli sensitive to usual antibiotics, or of streptococci. The genus Acinetobacter constituted the dominant flora in one case only. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Clostridium (C. perfringens), Bacteroides, Peptococcus, when present in the meconium, represented a very small proportion of the total flora. In the two children aged 48 h and more, the flora was more complex and Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium and Staphylococcus were associated to streptococci and enterobacteria. A very small number of lactobacilli was found in one child only. No yeasts were detected. The sequence of establishment of the various bacteria was studied in a child (OG) by an analysis of 8 samples obtained between 0 and 74 h after its birth. E. coli and Streptococcus became established 24 h after parturition, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides the 2nd and 3rd day, respectively. Lactobacillus and Peptococcus were only present in very low number in the first 2 meconium samples and did not become established in the child, although they were present in a rather large number in the vaginal and faecal samples from the mother. In addition, use of axenic mice inoculated with the 3rd meconium from the infant OG revealed the existence of certain genera of bacteria probably of faecal origin which had not been detected by the direct analysis of the meconium. These genera did not become established in the child. The hypothesis according to which the meconium chooses among the fortuitous contaminations before true colonization of the digestive tract is established, is discussed. It was also observed that the evolution of the ratio between the number of E. coli and Proteus morganii in the successive samples obtained from OG was very different from that observed in the mice inoculated with these samples.
TI  - Investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with Crohn's disease.
AB  - The immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with Crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. Two aerobic bacterial species, E. dispar and P. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, B. fragilis ss. fragilis, F. varium and two different strains of C. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. These strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the patient. Immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. In connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates. Antibodies belonging to IgG and IgA took part in the active immune response while IgM was very little involved. Antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. Antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. The importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with Crohn's disease is discussed.
TI  - Mechanism of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria: Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Cell-free amino acid incorporation using ribosomes from strains of either Clostridium perfringens or Bacteroides fragilis was shown to be susceptible to inhibition by streptomycin and gentamicin. Ribosomes bound dihydrostreptomycin as effectively as ribosomes from Escherichia coli. No inactivation of streptomycin or gentamicin was detected by cell extracts of either anaerobic bacterial species. B. fragilis, grown without added hemin, menadione, and fumarate, and C. perfringens did not show any time-dependent accumulation of dihydrostreptomycin or gentamicin at concentrations tested. Decreased resistance to aminoglycosides and time-dependent uptake of dihydrostreptomycin at 500 mug/ml was observed with B. fragilis grown with hemin, menadione, and fumarate. With the last additions, cytochrome b was detected by cytochrome spectra of B. fragilis. These results demonstrate that anaerobic bacteria unable to carry out oxygen- or nitrate-dependent electron transport are resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin because of failure to transport aminoglycosides. The induction of fumarate-dependent electron transport in B. fragilis is associated with some aminoglycoside transport that is of poor efficiency relative to bacteria with electron transport to oxygen or nitrate.

AB  - All the 28 Bacteroides fragilis strains investigated were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 16 mug/ml) and resistant to trimethoprim (TMP; minimal inhibitory concentration > 4 mug/ml). Synergism between sulfamethoxazole and TMP was present in all strains at a ratio of 1:1. The few clostridia investigated proved more resistant to both compounds. Dihydrofolate reductases from B. fragilis, C. perfringens, and some other anaerobic species were isolated. Inhibition profiles with six structurally different inhibitors revealed major differences in all enzymes. For 50% inhibition, the enzyme from B. fragilis and all clostridia required concentrations of TMP which were between several hundredfold and 1,000-fold higher than those required for the enzyme of Escherichia coli, whereas the enzyme from Propionibacterium acnes only needed a threefold higher concentration. In vitro activities of TMP were seen to correspond to the activity at the enzymatic level in B. fragilis and P. acnes, but correspond to a much lesser extent to the activity at the enzymatic level in clostridia, where a poor penetration is assumed to be involved. Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors other than TMP were found to be as active as TMP both at the enzyme and in vitro. In B. fragilis, higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine were required for increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of TMP than in E. coli and probably also in C. perfringens.
TI  - Gastroenteritis: etiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations.
AB  - The infectious etiologic agents of gastroenteritis are manifold and have only recently been studied in greater depth. Part of the problem in studies pertaining to diarrhea is the difficulty in identifying fecal "pathogens" among an enormous number of indigenous fecal microorganisms. Finally, the recognition of the pathogenicity of enterotoxins has created an awareness of the complexity of gastrointestinal physiology with host-parasite interactions.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of some combinations of pesticides of pure cultures of microorganisms.
AB  - The investigations conducted showed that the antibacterial effect of dinitro-o-cresol, cuprozane, and trichlorfon is due to their chemical structure and to the species of microorganisms on which they act. Dinitro-o-cresol and Cuprozane possess selective toxicity with respect to B. anthracis and Rh. gracilis and cuprozane with respect to Ch. perfringens. The method of evaluating the effect of combinations of chemical compounds consisting of two or more components which have been developed made it possible to detect the antibacterial effect of mixtures consisting of the indicated pesticides. It was established that the combinations studied possess synergic and additive effects, which also depend on the chemical structure of the pesticides and the species of microorganisms.
TI  - Sialyl- and fucosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of asparaginyl-linked oligosaccharides in glycoproteins. Mutually exclusive glycosylation by beta-galactoside alpha2 goes to 6 sialyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminide alpha1 goes to 3 fucosyltransferase.

TI  - Observations on the effect of different methods of processing on the bacterial contaminants of bovine and ovine tripe.
AB  - A comparison was made of the multiplication of bacteria in specimens of tripe processed in different ways. There was little difference in this respect between commercial tripe as offered for purchase to the consumer and rough and scraped tripe incubated at 30 degrees C for 24 h. Tripe stored at 4 degrees C or in acetic acid (pH 4) at 30 degrees C for 24 h, however, had appreciably fewer bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of metronidazole in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of metronidazole was investigated in anaerobic bacteria by use of time-viability studies. This antimicrobial agent has a rapid onset of bactericidal activity under proper reducing conditions. The bactericidal rates were not affected by inoculum size or nutritional requirements, nor by inhibition of growth and protein synthesis by chloramphenicol. Using supernatant fractions of actively growing cultures of susceptible organisms, we observed a disappearance of metronidazole and a loss of biological activity, but there was no significant change in preparations from resistant bacteria. The decrease in drug concentration with susceptible cells occurred during the time that its bactericidal action was being exerted. Extracts from susceptible organisms rapidly reduced the concentration of metronidazole, confirming previous observations which suggest that the drug acts as a terminal electron acceptor. Radioisotope experiments with [14C]metronidazole revealed that the compound was taken up by both resistant and susceptible bacteria, although there was a difference in rate and extent of accumulation. These studies demonstrate that metronidazole's antimicrobial activity against anaerobic bacteria is bactericidal and independent of growth rate, and that it involves the uptake and metabolism of the compound.
TI  - A circular dichroism study of DNA.platinum complexes. Differentiation between monofunctional, cis-bidentate and trans-bidentate platinum fixation on a series of DNAs.
AB  - The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of a series of DNA . platinum complexes are presented. The following platinum compounds, [Pt(dien)Cl]Cl, cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl2, cis-Pt(en)Cl2, trans-Pt-(NH3)2Cl2, K[Pt(NH3)Cl3] and K2[PtCl4] were complexed with the DNA extracted from bacteria Micrococcus lysodeikticus (72% dG + dC), Escherichia coli (50% dG + dC), Clostridium perfringens (32% dG + dC) and salmon sperm (41% dG + dC). Strong differences were found between the different DNA . Pt complexes. Three types of spectra clearly demonstrate the different platinum binding modes on DNA. In the first type, the platinum compound, i.e. [Pt(dien)Cl]Cl, is fixed to DNA with only one bond (monofunctional complex formation) and no significant change of the CD positive band of DNA is found. The main feature of the second type is a continuous intensity decrease of the positive band as observed for trans-Pt(NH3)2Cl2 (trans-bidentate complex formation). The third type concerns the cis-bidentate platinum fixation obtained with cis-Pt(NH3)2Cl2, cis-Pt(en)Cl2, K[Pt(NH3)Cl3] and K2[PtCl4]. The CD spectra are in this case characterized by an increase in the positive Cotton effect which is dG + dC-dependent up to an rb value around 0.10 (where rb = number of platinum atoms bound per nucleotide), followed by a decrease until DNA saturation with platinum is reached. A linear decrease in the amplitude of the negative band is detected in all the complexes except in the case of the monofunctional DNA . Pt complexes. For the cis-bidentate and trans-bidentate platinum fixation, a continuous bathochromic shift occurs.
TI  - [The quantitative composition of the gastrointestinal flora in piglets during the first weeks of life. 1. The development of the gastrointestinal flora in naturally reared piglets].
AB  - Studies were conducted into the quantitative composition of the gastro-intestinal flora of 30 naturally raised piglets in four age groups. The gastro-intestinal tract was found to be "flooded" by Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, micrococci, streptococci, proteus, and lactobacteria over the first hours after birth. Development of the intestinal flora was complete at the age of four days. The groups of germs recordable from naturally and artificially raised piglets were, basically, the same. Piglets, consequently, have no specific "lactoflora".
TI  - Qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  - Using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. Among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group A strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of Clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes). Among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with Haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested) and Proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bacteroides fragilis. Therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.

TI  - Microbiological investigation of meat wholesale premises and beef carcases in Johannesburg.
AB  - Microbiological surveillance by swabbing meat wholesaler premises revealed ineffective cleaning and build-up of bacteria. Proper cleaning, sanitation and handling resulted in a vast improvement during 1975-77. Beef samples from the neck of carcases in the wholesale trade were investigated by microbiological methods. Excessive total bacterial counts were obtained from numerous carcases. Most carcases carried coliform organisms. Roughly 90% of carcases were contaminated with E. coli I; counts exceeded 10(3)/g in 18% of carcases tested. Twenty serotypes of Salmonella were identified. Salmonella contamination decreased from nearly 5% in 1975 to less than 0,5% in 1977, and S. aureus contamination from 52% to 36% during the same period. Approximately 30% of carcases revealed contamination with unidentified clostridial species. The results indicate the need for stricter control over the production and slaughter of animals and over the handling of carcases in the wholesale trade.
TI  - Hydrolytic action of phospholipases on bacterial membranes.
AB  - Substrate specificities of phospholipases C[EC 3.1.4.3] from Clostridium novyi, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aureofaciens were studied under the same conditions. Phospholipases C from Clostridium novyi and Bacillus cereus show wide substrate specificities while those of Clostridium perfringens and Pseudomonas aureofaciens show relatively narrow specificities. On the basis of these results, the hydrolytic actions of these phospholipases on membrane lipids of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium novyi were examined under the same conditions. The enzymes of Clostridium novyi and Bacillus cereus attacked all the membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, and o-aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol. Phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aureofaciens attacked these three membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine. Phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hardly attacked the phospholipids of these bacterial membranes. However, phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hydrolyzed phosphatidylethanolamine in a mixture containing lipid extract from Escherichia coli membrane and purified phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk.
TI  - Anaerobes in human biliary tracts.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 1,892 patients underwent biliary tract surgery at the Mayo Clinic. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of bile were performed in 371 of these patients. Sixty-nine percent of the cultures were positive, and 41% (117) of these grew anaerobes, although they were present in pure culture only twice. Mixed cultures most commonly contained four different organisms (three aerobes and one anaerobe). Bacteroides fragilis was the single most commonly isolated anaerobe and ranked fourth in terms of overall isolates behind Escherichia coli, group D streptococci, and Klebsiella B. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total group D streptococci, and Klebsiella. B. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total aerobic and anaerobic isolates and was present in 21% of all positive cultures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens ranked fifth and sixth, providing 6.5 and 5.9% of all isolates, respectively. This study demonstrates the frequent presence of anaerobes in patients with bactibilia and suggests that they be considered in the formulation of antimicrobial therapy for infections involving human biliary tracts.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of two metabolites of 1-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-2-nitro-1 H-imidazole, an antiprotozoal agent.
AB  - 5-(-Hydroxyl-1-methylethyl-)-1-methyl-2-nitro-1 H-imidazole (6) and 5-(1,2-dihydroxyl-1-methylethyl)-1-methyl-2-nitro-1 H-imidazole (9) are the principal metabolites found in urines of animals (mice, rats, and dogs) treated with 1-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-2-nitro-1 H-imidazole (1), an effective antitrichomonas agent. These two metabolites have been synthesized. Compound 6 was found to be less toxic than the parent compound 1 and to possess essentially the same activity against Trichomonas vaginalis in experimental infections. Compound 9 showed a low degree of in vivo activity.

TI  - Bacteriology of the human biliary tract and the duodenum.
AB  - Using the modern anaerobic transport media and meticulous culture techniques, 74  patients undergoing biliary tract surgery were studied. The biliary system was found to be sterile in 58 patients (78%). Fifteen patients had 35 isolates of aerobic and facultative bacteria. The most common ones were Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli. The only anaerobe isolated was Clostridium perfringens. Eight of 17 patients (47%) with acute cholecystitis and five of 49 patients (10%) with chronic cholecystitis, harbored bacteria in the biliary system. This study suggests that anaerobes are rare in the human biliary system; therefore, if antibiotic therapy is considered, aerobic coverage should suffice.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in biliary disease in elderly patients.
AB  - Gallbladder bile from 52 elderly subjects who had undergone biliary tract surgery was examined for the presence of bacteria. Twelve patients had sterile bile, 18 specimens of bile yielded anaerobes as well as aerobes, and 22 yielded aerobic bacteria only. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated organism (30 strains). Bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently encountered anaerobic bacterium and was found in 15 patients. The Klebsiella-Enterobacter group was the second most commonly isolated group and B. fragilis was third. Clostridium perfringens was recovered in 10 specimens of bile. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered more frequently in patients with ductal obstruction. The relatively frequent isolation of anaerobes, especially of B. fragilis, in this study may be related to the anaerobic techniques used, to the age of the patients, and to the high incidence of pigment stones among the subjects.

AB  - Immediate gram stains were performed on gallbladder bile aspirated at the start of an operation for biliary disease in 191 consecutive patients undergoing elective biliary surgery. The results of the gram stains were telephoned to the operating theater within 20 minutes of collection. The over-all accuracy rate of the telephone gram stain reports compared with the subsequent bile cultures was 77 percent. The incidence of false-positive results was 12 percent, and false-negative results were recorded in 7 percent. The organism was identified wrongly by the gram stain in 4 percent of patients. These results have improved with experience and the over-all accuracy rate of gram stains on bile over the last 6 months have been 87 percent.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in spontaneous peritonitis of cirrhosis: report of two cases and review of the literature.
AB  - The role of anaerobic or microaerophillic bacteria in spontaneous peritonitis of  cirrhosis has not been clearly defined. Among 126 cases recorded in the literature, in only eight (6 per cent), including the two reported here, was bacterascites associated with anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria. Clinical features in these cases were indistinguishable from those associated with aerobic bacteria. However, polymicrobial bacterascites occurred in four of eight cases associated with anaerobes, as contrasted with only 10 of 118 cases (8 per cent) associated with aerobes alone. On the other hand, concurrent bacteremia occurred in only one of eight cases associated with anaerobes as contrasted with 52 of 118 cases (44 per cent) of aerobic spontaneous peritonitis. Experimental evidence is cited in an attempt to explain this relatively low incidence of spontaneous peritonitis associated with anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria, despite the high density of these organisms in the normal bowel flora.
TI  - Characterization of DNA strand breakage in vitro by the antitumor protein neocarzinostatin.
AB  - The antitumor protein antibiotic neocarzinostatin causes strand scission of DNA in vitro in the presence of a sulfhydryl compound. The breaks are single stranded in nature and bear 5'-phosphoryl termini. All four deoxymononucleotides are recoverable at the 5'-ends of the cleavage sites although a higher proportion of dGMP and TMP are consistently found. The lesions are not repairable with polynucleotide ligase from Escherichia coli. A quantitative assay was developed to determine the pH profile and time course of the reaction. Data from protection experiments with synthetic and natural DNAs indicate the requirement for thymidylic acid and deoxyadenylic acid in the DNA for cutting. In DNA-RNA hybrids, riboadenylic acid can substitute for deoxyadenylic acid, whereas ribouridylic acid cannot substitute for thymidylic acid. Release of thymine is detected, and the amount of release correlates well with the number of strand scissions.
TI  - Gas gangrene and related infection: classification, clinical features and aetiology, management and mortality. A report of 88 cases.
AB  - The clinical features of gas gangrene and related infection seen in 88 patients over a 10-year period are described. It is suggested that clostridial infection could be simply classified as either 'gas-forming' or 'non-gas-forming'. The gas-forming group represents the more severe form of infection. Non-clostridial gas gangrene may present in a variety of forms. The anaerobic streptococcus was the organism most frequently responsible, but these cases were indistinguishable from clostridial infection on clinical grounds. The treatment of gas gangrene in this series of patients is reported. Emphasis is laid on the importance of adequate prophylaxis with penicillin in patients at risk. The value of antibiotics in established infection remains equivocal. The evidence supporting the value of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is assessed and an attempt made to quantify the response to this treatment. Benefit was apparent in only a proportion of patients. A favourable response indicated clostridial infection and guaranteed immediate survival. Extensive debridement or amputation is unnecessary in this group. No response following hyperbaric oxygen therapy indicated widespread mixed clostridial and non-clostridial infection, or infection due to organisms other than clostridia. Urgent and extensive debridement and amputation remain the predominant measures in this group.

TI  - Influence of cationic triphenylmethane dyes upon DNA polymerization and product hydrolysis by Escherichia coli polymerase I.
AB  - The cationic triphenylmethane dyes crystal violet, methyl green, and malachite green inhibited DNA synthesis catalyzed by Escherichia coli B polymerase I (polymerase I). Lower concentrations of the dyes inhibited DNA replication as a direct function of the proportion of AT to GC in the DNA of Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus lysodeikticus. When the intercalant proflavin was employed, the GC-rich micrococcal DNA was most severely inhibited. In addition, both the triphenylmethanes and proflavin inhibited product hydrolysis catalyzed by polymerase I.
TI  - A rapid glutamic decarboxylase test for identification of bacteria.
AB  - A simple rapid glutamic decarboxylase test is described. This test was found useful in the identification of Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Providencia alcalifaciens, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of foodborne diseases.
AB  - Many bacterial species are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne intoxication and infection. The foodborne diseases are classified on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved into four categories: performed toxin, enterotoxin formed in the colonized small intestine, mucosal invasion (enterocolitis) and mucosal invasion with bacteremia. Invasive and toxigenic strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are discussed. In vivo test systems for the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms and tissue culture assays for the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli are described. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of foodborne diseases of major public health interest are reviewed - botulism, staphylococcal intoxication, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, salmonellosis, enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and Bacillus cereus enteritis. The role of the laboratory in the epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of foodborne diseases is emphasized.
TI  - Bifidobacteria in the intestinal tract of infants: an in-vivo study.
AB  - Weekly faecal specimens from 18 babies were examined during the first 8 weeks of  life. Eight infants were breast fed, ten were bottle-fed. All suckling infants received supplementary feeds for the first 8 days. A buffer consisting of acetic acid and acetate was demonstrated in the faeces of all the breast-fed infants at some time during the period of examination. This buffer was rarely detected during the 1st week of life when supplementary feeds were given, and buffer already present gradually disappeared with the introduction of mixed feeding. In contrast, at no time was an acetate buffer demonstrated in the faeces of bottle-fed infants. Babies receiving breast milk produced faeces with low pH, high counts of saccharolytic organisms including bifidobacteria and Streptococcus faecium, and low counts of Escherichia coli, bacteroides and clostridia. Bottle-fed infants on the other hand produced faeces with a high pH and high counts of E. coli and putrefactive bacteria, but with low counts of bifidobacteria.
TI  - Bacteria in hip surgery. A study of routine aerobic and anaerobic cultivation from skin and closed suction wound drains.
AB  - One hundred and seven patients with closed suction wound drains after hip surgery were investigated with regard to bacteria in the drain. In one-third of the cases bacterial contamination of the wound was found. In more than half the total number of cases the bacteria in the wound were not identical with those found on the skin, either pre- or post-operatively. Anaerobe bacteria occurred only in one case. Penicillin administration considerably reduced the frequency of positive cultures. These findings support the prophylactic use of antibiotics in the prevention of late infections in endoprosthesis operations even when the early infection rate is satisfactorily low.
TI  - Bacteriological quality and shelf life of ground beef.
AB  - The bacteriological quality of unfrozen raw ground beef was evaluated after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 days of storage at 29 +/- 1 F (-1.7 +/- 0.6 C). At the time of fabrication, all of the ground beef samples contained 10(6) or fewer total aerobic and psychrotrophic bacteria/g; 81% contained 100 or fewer coliforms/g; 94% contained 100 or fewer Escherichia coli/g; and all of the samples contained 100 or fewer coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens/g. Total aerobic and psychrotrophic bacteria increased by 1 log between 3 and 18 days of storage. Coliform and E. coli counts decreased during storage, whereas coagulase-positive S. aureus and C. perfringens counts did not change significantly. These data indicate that meat processors, wholesalers, and retailers could improve the bacteriological quality and prolong the shelf life of ground beef packaged in oxygen-impermeable film if the temperature of product never exceeded 29 +/- 1 F (-1.7 +/- 0.6 C).
TI  - [Researches on the water quality of the river Po and its tributaries between Cremona and Casalmaggiore. I. materials and methods (author's transl)].
AB  - During 1971 a research program about the status of pollution of the river Po and  its tributaries was started by six Institutes of Hygiene altogether (Turin, Pavia, Milan, Parma, Modena and Ferrara Universities) with the Institute for Water Research of C.N.R. and Hydrographic Office of Magistracy of the Po. The role of the Parma University Hygiene Institute was to study the water qualities of the river Po between Cremona and Casalmaggiore and of two right side tributaries, Arda-Ongina and Taro. The hydrogeographical characteristics of the examined reach are reported in the present note, with special reference to the hydrological conditions, basin area, inhabitants and industrial typology. The sampling stations were placed upstream and downstream Cremona town, near Casalmaggiore and at the mouth of Arda-Ongina and Taro. Moreover the methods, for chemical and bacteriological analysis are reported.
TI  - The effect of silver ion binding and pH on the buoyant density of DNA and its use in fractionating heterogeneous DNA.
AB  - 1. The effect of pH on the buoyant density of the complexes of Ag+ with DNA has been studied using 3H-labeled human DNA and several bacterial DNAs to determine the conditions necessary for the maximum resolution of compositional heterogeneity. In neutral CS2SO4 density gradients, Ag+ complexes with (G - C)-rich components are always denser than those with (A - T)-rich components, since (G - C)rich DNAs have a larger affinity for Ag+ than (A - T)-rich DNAs and their complexes are denser than (A - T)-rich complexes. In alkaline (pH greater than 9) CS2SO4 gradients, the buoyant density of the Ag+ - DNA complex is not a simple function of base composition. The Ag+ affinity of (A - T)-rich DNA is larger than that of (G - C)-rich DNA but the density of a (G - C)-rich complex is larger. Thus the ordering of the buoyant density changes depends on the amount of added Ag+. 2. The problem of resolving the density heterogeneity within a tracer DNA, and minor components of DNA, is explored and useful fractionation techniques are developed.
TI  - Evolution of the digestive microflora in a unit of specified-pathogen-free mice:  efficiency of the barrier.
AB  - RhoIco strain], barrier-maintained since 1970, is described. Some "contaminants"  appeared spontaneously during the period 1971-1973, but microorganisms belonging to the genera Lactobacillus Streptococcus, Enterobacteria, Escherichia and Bacillus remained stable. The methods of investigation used were not suitable for the assessment of strictly anaerobic strains. The stability of the digestive microflora durine the last 2 years of this study is believed to be related to the skill and conscientiousness of the technicians responsible for the daily care of these mice.
TI  - Effect of delayed evisceration on the microbial quality of meat.
AB  - The postomortem invasion of muscle and other tissues by bacteria from the intestinal tract was studied with the use of radioactive tracers. The injection of 14C-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14C throughout carcasses. When live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, it was not possible to isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. It appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. It therefore seems that a delay of up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 C remained sterile.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic flora in bladder urine of patients with indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  - Twenty-five bladder urine specimens from 13 patients with long-standing indwelling catheters were obtained by percutaneous suprapubic needle aspiration to avoid contamination by extraneous flora and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Twenty different species of organism were isolated from twenty-four positive specimens. The isolates were predominantly gram-negative aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacilli, with occasional gram-positive aerobic cocci and yeasts. One patient had Clostridium perfringens and a Bifidobacterium and another had Veillonella and two species of Bifidobacterium. Both patients had four concomitant aerobic or facultative bacteria present. Anaerobic bacteria may therefore be found in the bladder urine of some patients with indwelling urethral catheters, but their role in the initiation and perpetuation of urinary tract infection in this setting remains unclear.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - Pregnancy interrupting effects of some bacterial toxins.
AB  - Embryotoxic properties of Shigella dysenteriae and Clostridium perfringens toxins, of E. coli endotoxin, V. cholerase and E. coli enterotoxins were compared in mice. E. coli endotoxin has embryotoxic effects at all stages of pregnancy. E. coli enterotoxin V. cholerae enterotoxin and Shigella dysenteriae toxin are most effective mainly at earlier stages of pregnancy. Clostridium perfringens toxin has no embryotoxic effect.
TI  - Competitive inhibition of transformation in group H Streptococcus strain Challis  by heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - Glucosylated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from phages T4 and T6 competes poorly with homologous DNA causing only a slight decrease of transformation in Group H Streptococcus strain Challis. Other types of heterologous DNAs (Micrococcus luteus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, calf thymus and non-glucosylated phage T6 DNA), in contrast to glucosylated T4 and T6 DNAs, compete with transforming DNA to the normal, high extent. These results indicate that as in transformation of Bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in phage T6 DNA considerably decreases the interaction of such DNA with competent cells of the Challis strain. It also indicates that the guanine plus cytosine content of DNA is not decisive in determining its interaction with competent cells.
TI  - The reduction of N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  - The role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of N-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. This reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. These include cultures of Clostridium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus productus I, and Bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. In contrast, cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. The reduction of N-OH-AABP is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. On a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing N-OH-AABP than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing N-OH-AABP than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. The products of the metabolism of N-OH-AABP have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. Glucuronide conjugates of N-OH-AABP are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. These results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing N-OH-AABP, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
TI  - Histopathological effect of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin in the rabbit ileum.
AB  - Highly purified enterotoxin from Clostridium perfringens was found to have histopathological activity in the rabbit ileum. Unlike the action of cholera, Escherichia coli, and Shigella enterotoxins, epithelium was denuded from the tips of ileal villi at concentrations of the enterotoxin necessary to induce fluid accumulation in the rabbit. Whether or not this observed histopathology is essential for the diarrheal syndrome associated with Clostridium perfringens food poisoning remains unclear.
TI  - Bacterial growth in seafoood on restaurant premises.
AB  - Operational guidelines for a chain of the newer type of seafood restaurants and take-out stores were derived from plots of bacteriological and trimethylamine changes during the preparation and storage of cod fillets, shrimp, and clams. If fish is to be defrosted at room temperature it should be washed and portioned within 14 h. Subsequent storage at 5 degrees C should not exceed 72 h and once removed from the refrigerator it should be fried within 3 h. New stores should consider improved methods of defrosting. Trimethylamine content was a more sensitive measure of quality loss than bacterial growth. Shrimp quality can be improved by emphasizing the way shells are removed because most of the contamination was external. Shrimp shelled while still frozen had the best potential keeping quality. Clam meat is handled less and is always held at 5 degrees C; but bacterial growth indicated that it should not be held on the premises for more than 3 days including the time necessary for defrosting. Batter prepared fresh daily can be feft at room temperature. Frying can obliterate poor handling procedures, but adequate cooking is essential under any conditions. Clams are a gourmet item but the practice of cooking them lightly at customer request proved inadvisable.
TI  - Hematological findings in acute infections and septicemias.
AB  - This paper is a report on twelve cases of septicemia, the diagnosis made possible by medical technologists observing the degenerative morphological findings in the peripheral blood smears. This led to the finding of microorganisms, prior to the bacteriological confirmation, in an active emergency department. It also includes four case reports in which the organism was identified: a meningococcus, a pneumonococcus, an Escherichia coli, and a clostridium perfringens (welchii).
TI  - Convenient non-chromatographic assays for the microbial deconjugation and 7alpha-OH bioconversion of taurocholate.
AB  - We described two convenient assay methods to estimate bile acid deconjugation and bile acid bioconversion at the 7alpha-OH position by individual microorganisms grown in media containing taurocholic acid. The methods are based on (i) a selective chemical assay for taurine conjugates previously described and (ii) the use of a cell-free preparation of 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli to directly quantify 7alpha-OH groups. These non-chromatographic approaches have been applied to the study of three model strains of intestinal organisms, E. coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens, grown in standard media in the presence of purified tritiated taurocholate. Assay results were confirmed by thin-layer chromatography solvent systems designed to separate conjugated from unconjugated bile acid and unmodified cholic acid nucleus from 7alpha-OH bioconversion product(s) (primarily 3alpha, 12alpha dihydroxy, 7-keto-cholanoic acid). In addition, 7alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was demonstrated in cell-free extracts of all three organisms. Of the three organisms, only C. perfringens was demonstrated to (i) deconjugate taurocholic acid, (ii) contain 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, (iii) convert cholic acid into at least five labeled metabolites visible on thin-layer chromatography, and (iv) catalyze significant tritium exchange with water in the medium.
TI  - Effect of Klebsiella pneumoniae enterotoxin on intestinal transport in the rat.
AB  - The effects on intestinal transport of either a semipurified preparation of enterotoxin elaborated by Klebsiella pneumoniae or similaryly prepared control material were tested by marker perfusion studies in the small intestine of rats. At a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the enterotoxin produced net secretion of water, Na, and Cl in both jejunal and ileal segments; HCO3 transport was not affected. Net secretion was evident within 30 min after intorduction of the toxin and was maximal after 90 min. The addition of 56 mM glucose to the enterotoxin-containing perfusion fluid resulted in reversal of water and Na transport to net absorption in both intestinal segments. The enterotoxin also produced a significant depression of xylose absorption in both the jejunum and ileum but did not affect the absorption of either glucose or L-leucine. Intestinal structure was not altered after perfusion of the toxin but insillation of approximately one-quarter of the total perfusion dose into a ligated jejunal loop for 18 h produced fluid secretion and structural abnormalities. These observations confirm the fact that other species of coliform bacteria in addition to tescherichia coli are capable of elaborating an enterotoxin. Such species commonly contaminate the small intestine of persons with tropical sprue and it is suggested that chronic exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the enterotoxin elaborated by these bacteria may be a factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal abnormalities in thid disorder.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
TI  - Evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  - Seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including Culturette, Trans-Cul (with Stuart and Amies), Handiswab, Securline (with Amies and Amies without charcoal) and Culture Caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25C and 4C. The results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25C they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. No one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. Most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.
TI  - Survival of human enteric and other sewage microorganisms under simulated deep-sea conditions.
AB  - The survival of pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus under simulated deep-sea conditions of low temperature (4 C), seawater, and hydrostatic pressures ranging from 1 to 1,000 atm was determined over a period exceeding 300 h. The viability of E. coli and total aerobic bacteria in seawater-diluted raw sewage subjected to these deep-sea conditions was also measured. There was a greater survival of both E. coli and S. faecalis at 250 and 500 atm than at 1 atm at 4 C. S. faecalis was quite insensitive to 1,000 atm, whereas with E. coli there was a 10-fold die-off per 50-h exposure to 1,000 atm. In contrast, V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens were quite sensitive to pressures exceeding 250 atm, and with both of these species there was a total loss of viability of approximately 10(8) cells per ml within 100 h at 1,000 arm and within 200 h at 500 atm. The viability of the naturally occurring fecal coliforms in sewage exposed to moderate pressures at 4 C was found to be similar to the survival patterns demonstrated with pure cultures of E. coli. The total numbers of aerobic bacteria in these sewage samples, however, stabilized at 500 and 1,000 atm after 100 h, and at 1 and 250 atm there was significant growth of sewage-associated bacteria, which apparently utilized the organic compounds in the seawater-diluted sewage samples. A preliminary classification of some of these bacteria indicated that approximately 90% (160 isolates) of the organisms that survived over a 400-h exposure to 500 and 1,000 atm were Arthrobacter/Corynebacterium species, and the representative organisms capable of growing at 1 and 250 atm in seawater at 4 C were gram-positive cellulose digesters and an unidentified gram-negative coccus. The significance of these results with respect to the contamination of the deep ocean with human pathogens and the possibility of sewage-associated microorganisms growing and competing with indigenous marine microbial flora in situ is discussed.

TI  - Sensitive assay for detection of toxin-induced damage to the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts.
AB  - A sensitive assay was developed for detection and quantitation of subtle permeability changes in the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts. Release of the non-metabolizable amino acid [1-14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB; molecular weight (103) from the cytoplasm of prelabeled cells was used as an indicator of toxin-induced membrane damage. An optimal procedure for labeling these cells was designed after varying the conditions with regard to pH, temperature, concentration of AIB, composition of medium, and incubation time. Toxin-induced release of AIB was compared with release of a previously described nucleotide label, [3H]uridine. Melittin from bee venom and the polyene antibiotics filipin and amphotericin B in low concentrations induced a strikingly greater release of AIB than of nucleotide label. The sensitivity of this assay was furthermore demonstrated by treatment with the following bacterial cytolysins: phospholipase C and theta-toxin from Clostridium perfringens, alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-toxins from Staphylococcus aureus, and streptolysin S from Streptococcus pyogenes. In spite of their different modes of action, all these membrane-active toxins at low concentrations induced a significant release of AIB label. For an equal release of nucleotide label, several times higher concentrations were required.

TI  - The quantitative bacteriology of some commercial bivalve shellfish entering British markets.
AB  - Incidents of non-specific illness associated with the consumption of oysters have highlighted the lack of published information on the bacteriology of shellfish suitable for consumption. Investigations showed that the majority of molluscan shellfish entering English markets conform to the accepted standard of less than 5 Escherichia coli/ml. tissue. The numbers of E. coli were related to the sanitary quality of the growing area but no relation could be established between numbers of E. coli and coliforms, faecal streptococci or Clostridium welchii. The numbers of non-specific bacteria varied considerably but shellfish from sources associated with non-specific illness yielded relatively high counts at 37 degrees C. The results showed that there was no justification for a standard based on total plate counts, which often exceeded 10(6)/g. Such a standard would have to be coupled with spoilage or the incidence of non-specific illness. The relation between the numbers of non-specific bacteria growing at 20 and 37 degrees C. appears to be a useful measure for assessing the likelihood that raw shellfish are a public health risk.
TI  - On the structure of the peptidoglycan of cell walls from Myxobacter AL-1 (myxobacterales).
AB  - Basically the peptidoglycan of Myxobater AL-1 consists of alternating beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamic-N-acetylmuramic acid chains. After splitting the aminosugar backbone with a specific algal enzyme three subunits arise: a monomer, a dimer and a timer. Investigation of the monomer with specific enzymes and comparison of the degradation products to standards derived from other bacterial peptidoglycans suggest the following structure of the monomer peptide: L-alanyl-D-glutamic-L-meso-diaminopimelic-D-alanine. A D-alanyl-D-meso-diaminopimelic acid bond is the bridgebond between the peptides of the subunits.
TI  - Interactions of heteroaromatic compounds with nucleic acids. 2. Influence of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of intercalating ligands.
AB  - This paper presents the results of a systematic study on the effects of substituents on the base and sequence specificity of tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds interacting with DNA by intercalation. All the compounds tested are derived from proflavine and acridine orange analogs with different heteroatoms in the middle ring. Their base and sequence specificities were determined by differential dialysis of the ligand against DNA samples of differing G-C content. The main results indicate that (a) the introduction of a phenyl substituent into one of the two available positions of the middle ring increases or decreases the G-C specificity of the ligand depending on the position where the substitution takes place; (b) compounds of the substitution type of neutral red (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethyl-amino-phenazine) show unexpectedly high G-C specificities and (c) DNA ligands of pronounced sequence specificity for adjacent G-C pairs can be constructed by combining the structural elements of neutral red with an additional phenyl residue in the same molecule. The further study of compounds related to the phenylated neutral red revealed that the G-C specificity can be improved or destroyed by additional substituents. The comparison of the G-C specificity and the DNA-affinity data of the compounds studied leads to the suggestion that the specificity arises mainly from electronic factors which are strongly controlled through steric constraints on possible ocmplex geometries. As a basis for the discussion a possible structure for the DNA complex of the phenylated neutral red is considered in which the extra phenyl ring at N-5 of the phenazinium system, protrudes into the large groove of the DNA helix while the tricyclic part of the ligand is inserted between the DNA base-pairs.
TI  - The compatibility of netropsin and actinomycin binding to natural deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - The simultaneous binding of netropsin and actinomycin to four natural DNAs was studied to determine the influence of one ligand on the binding of the other. Actinomycin binds specifically to GC sites, whereas netropsin binds specifically to AT sites. Spectral titrations, thermal denaturation, and analytical buoyant density centrifugation were employed to measure the binding interference of these drugs. The binding of actinomycin to DNA was decreased by the presence of netropsin. Increasing the GC content of the DNA resulted in a decreased effect of netropsin on actinomycin binding. Quantitative analysis of the binding parameters indicated that netropsin and actinomycin can bind in close proximity along the DNA chain. Supercoiled DNA gave the same result as linear DNA. These results imply that DNA can absorb alterations in conformation within a short distance.
TI  - Prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section.
AB  - Using a random selection procedure, 100 patients were evaluated in order to determine the value of prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section. All patients were evaluated for febrile morbidity, and specific infection sites were recorded. Significant differences were found between the treated and control groups and between cesarean sections performed prior to the onset of labor and after the onset of labor.

AB  - The changes in absorption spectra in the visible region observed on adding different naturally occurring and synthetic DNA duplexes to solutions of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein indicate that the mercurial reacts with polynucleotides of this type. The reaction is reversible as proved by adding excess of KCN which restores the original spectra of the free dye. The interaction is characterised also by quenching of the fluorescence of the dye and the induction of optical activity in it. The extent of these spectral effects depends strongly on the (A+T) content of the complexed DNA and decreased in the order: poly [d(A-T)], Clostridium perfringens DAN, Escherichia coli DNA, Micrococcus luteus DNA and poly(dC). From equilibrium-dialysis experiments the same order in affinity is obtained when these poly-nucleotides are at equilibrium with the same concentration of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein. From the changes produced by different mercurials in the ORD spectra and viscosity of a DNA solution it has been concluded that 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein does not cause any drastic alteration of the secondary structure of DNA.
TI  - Clostridium septicemia following biliary surgery in a gastrectomized patient.
AB  - A 75-year-old woman was subjected to biliary surgery 38 years after partial gastrectomy for ulcer. There was a history of gallstones of 10 years duration, pentagastrin-resistant achylia, cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis complicated by stenosis of papilla of vater, cholecystitis and pancreatitis. Peroperative cholangiography and biliary tract surgery were performed. On the third postoperative day heavy jaundice and hemolysis developed, leading to death of the patient. Culture of bile taken at operation revealed strains of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli. Autopsy showed a picture of gas gangraena of the liver and Clostridium septicemia. The role of achylia, blind loop, and biliary obstruction in bile surgery is stressed.
TI  - Classification of enterotoxins on the basis of activity in cell culture.
AB  - Two cell culture systems were used in a study of the biological properties of several bacterial enterotoxins in vitro. By means of one model, in which HeLa cell monolayers were used, cytotoxic effects, interms of detachment of cells from a glass surface due to cell death, were assayed. By means of the second model, activation of the adenyl cyclase-cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (AMP) system, in terms of increased steroidogenesis by Y-1 adrenal cells (an effect which we have termed cytotonic), was assayed. None of the four toxins manifested both properties. Rather there was a clear segregation into two cytotoxic enterotoxins (Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and Clostridium perfingens) and two cytotonic products (Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli). These data raise the possibility that some enterotoxins may not interact with the adenyl cyclase-cyclic AMP system; this possibility has also been suggested by studies of the toxin of S. dysenteriae type 1 in the rabbit small bowel. These cell culture systems may therefore serve as convenient models for the study of the mechanism of action of both classes of enterotoxin.

TI  - The recovery of anaerobic bacteria from swabs.
AB  - When a standard sample of simulated exudate containing known numbers of anaerobic bacteria was taken up on a swab and plated on solid medium, the number of colonies subsequently cultured represented a very small proportion of the original sample. Evidence is produced that the apparent loss is not primarily attributable to inactivation on the swab but rather to retention of organisms on the swab. This was demonstrable with Clostridium welchii and with Bacteroides species that have hitherto been regarded as relatively oxygen-sensitive.When stock strains of Bacteroides species were held for some hours on swabs, some progressive loss of viability was demonstrable. A measure of protection was afforded when these organisms were held aerobically on blood agar medium, but a very exacting anaerobe and some wild strains of faecal anaerobes showed gradual inactivation under these conditions.These findings may have important implications in relation to currently employed bacteriological sampling procedures with swabs in clinical practice.

Samples of liquid nutrient medium inoculated with a small number of bacteria, to which dilutions of a drug had been added before incubation and again later, were filtered and the membranes washed and incubated on solid medium. By this means differences between bacteriostatic and bactericidal action were clearly demonstrated. It was shown that staphylococci which had survived exposure to penicillin or gentamicin at levels below their minimum bactericidal concentrations remained fully responsive to the subsequent addition of more of the same drug, while those which had survived exposure to chloramphenicol or clindamycin were not significantly affected by further addition, so that neither of the latter two drugs was bactericidal against the strain of organism used. Bactericidal effects were also demonstrated by benzyl penicillin against Clostridium welchii and ampicillin against Escherichia coli.
TI  - Fractionation of DNA on hydroxyapatite with a base-specific complexing agent.
AB  - We describe a chromatographic technique for separating mixtures of DNA of varying G + C content. The method employs a specially prepared high-capacity hydroxyapatite and a G.C-specific DNA ligand (2-methyl-3-amino-7-dimethylamino-5-phenyl-phenazinium cation, abbreviated PNR). DNA molecules rich in G.C pairs bind larger amounts of this dye and are eluted earlier from the hydroxyapatite column than are molecules rich in A.T pairs. The dye can easily be removed from DNA by dialysis or solvent extraction after the chromatographic separation. The resolution of the method approaches that of CsCl density gradient separation, and the capacity of the column is much larger than that of a typical density gradient experiment. Elution of the DNA is not dependent on molecular weight, so samples of different molecular weight can be separated on the basis of G + C content. The technique should be especially useful for separating G.C-rich minor components from DNA obtained form eukaryotic cells, as demonstrated by a fraction of DNA from calf thymus.

AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  - Variation of type-B DNA x-ray fiber diagrams with base composition.
AB  - Eight natural DNAs of widely differing base composition have been studied by x-ray diffraction in fibers at high relative humidity. The resulting type B diffraction diagrams showed that all of the DNAs had a 34-A pitch and 3.4-A interbase pair separation. However, the intensity distribution on the inner three layer lines was a strong function of the base content. In diffraction diagrams of very AT-rich DNA, the intensity of the first and third layer line was 2- or 3-times stronger than in the patterns of GC-rich DNA. These high humidity diffraction patterns agree with x-ray scattering from solutions of DNA. The results are interpreted to imply that each AT base pair may have a different cross section than a GC pair. If this is so, it would appreciably alter the currently held ideas concerning DNA recognition.

AB  - The Skylab manned space flight program presented unique food microbiology problems. This challenge was successfully met by careful evaluation of the total Skylab food system by considering the nature of Skylab foods, their processing and handling, and Skylab food safety requirements. Some of the unique problems encountered with the Skylab foods involved: extended storage times, variations in storage temperatures, no opportunity to resupply or charge foods after launch of the Skylab Workshop, first use of frozen foods in space, first use of a food-warming device in weightlessness, relatively small size of production lots requiring statistically valid sampling plans, and use of the food as an accurately controlled segment of sophisticated life science experiments. Consideration of all of these situations generated the need for definitive microbiological tests and test limits. These tests are described in this paper along with the rationale for their selection. Test results are reported which show successful compliance with the test limits.

Of indicator organisms for fecal and sewage contamination, Escherichia coli were found in 3.2% and Streptococcus fecalis in 5.4% of the samples. The heat treatment applied during processing is not sufficient to destroy these organisms.

Although some multiplication also occurred in the centre of large roasts cooled under refrigeration, the viable counts were considered too low to constitute a potential health risk.

Gas-liquid chromatography of the methyl esters of extractable fatty acids revealed distinctive "pattern profiles" of Clostridium botulinum toxigenic types "A," "B," and "E." C. perfringens type "A" and Escherichia coli strain "B" were also studied in a similar manner and were found to give pattern profiles which were distinct even from those obtained for the C. botulinum microorganisms. Amino sugar content of the five microorganisms was determined by using a Beckman amino acid analyzer. The molar ratio of glucosamine to that of galactosamine was found to be of further assistance in distinguishing the individual microorganisms.

After 2 weeks at 5 C, numbers of aerobes on the surface of rolls, in slices, and in whole rolls reached levels of from 1 to 10 million per cm(2) or per g. In stored whole rolls, coliform and enterococcus counts ranged, respectively, from about 10,000 to more than 1 million per g and from < 100 to more than 1 million per g. Postcooking processing operations in two plants did not significantly affect the total count of turkey rolls. Eight of 28 rolls obtained after handling and packaging contained coagulase-positive staphylococci.

The specificity of enzyme action was elucidated by reduction of liberated glycosidic groups with NaBH(4) and identification of glucosaminol as the reduction product. This finding contradicts previous reports associating cell wall breakdown with specific phospholipase action.

AB  - A graphical formula is presented for determining the base ratio of melted DNA. By use of this formula, the composition of sequences which melt in different portions of the melting curves of Clostridium DNA, Escherichia coli DNA, and mouse DNA were determined. As the DNA melts, the per cent of adenine and thymine (AT) in the melted sequences decreases linearly with temperature. The average composition of sequences which melt in a given part of the melting curve is proportional to the base ratio of the DNA. The concentration and average composition of sequences were determined for three parts of the melting curves of the DNA samples, and a frequency distribution curve was constructed. The curve is symmetrical and has a maximum at about 56% AT. The distribution of GC-rich sequences on the E. coli chromosome was estimated by shearing, partially melting, and fractionating the DNA on hydroxylapatite. GC-rich sequences appear to occur every thousand base pairs, and have a maximum length of about 180 base pairs. The graphical formula was applied to the determination of the composition of sequences which melt in different parts of the melting curve of chromatin. Throughout the melting curve, the composition of the melting sequences is about 60% AT, which appears to suggest that relatively long sequences are melting simultaneously. Their melting temperature may be a function of the composition of the protein on different parts of the DNA. The problem of light scattering in DNA-protein and DNA was also investigated. A formula is presented which corrects for light scattering by relating the intensity of the scattered light to the rate of change of absorbance of DNA with wavelength.

AB  - Growing microcolonies of bacteria can be detected by their light-scattering property. We have described a system in which growing bacteria in glass capillaries filled with nutrient agar are counted as the capillaries move through a narrow beam of light. Increased counts after incubation indicate the presence of viable organisms in the original sample; the equipment can detect colonies when they grow to a diameter of 8 microm. Aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative organisms can grow in the capillary environment. The sensitivities of several organisms to antibiotics were determined by adding antibiotics to the agar before the capillaries were filled.
TI  - Lysis of Escherichia coli by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and phospholipases as measured by beta-galactosidase activity.
AB  - A permeaseless mutant of Escherichia coli, which produces beta-galactosidase constitutively, was treated briefly with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and then with the phospholipases of Bacillus cereus. Cell lysis occurred, as indicated by an increase in beta-galactosidase activity and a decrease in absorbancy of the cell suspension. The susceptibility of the cells to attack by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and the phospholipases was markedly affected by the age of the cells when harvested. The results suggest that permeability changes may be associated with the activity of a phospholipase that specifically degrades phosphatidyl ethanolamine. A sonic-treatment method for determining the total beta-galactosidase content of E. coli cells, which is independent of their age when harvested, is described.

AB  - Duplicate fecal specimens from food handlers were collected in Louisiana. One set of specimens was examined immediately for salmonellae and shigellae by the Central Laboratory of the Louisiana State Board of Health in New Orleans; the other set was shipped to the Food Microbiology Unit at the Robert A. Taft Sanitary Engineering Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, where it was examined for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EEC) and Clostridium perfringens. A total of 219 specimens were examined by both laboratories. None yielded salmonellae or shigellae; 171 (78.1%) yielded C. perfringens; 175 (79.9%) yielded E. coli; and 14 (6.4%) yielded EEC. The 14 isolates of EEC were distributed among eight serotypes; one specimen yielded two serotypes. Multiple isolations of C. perfringens strains (two to four) were made from 64 (37.4%) of the specimens, and a total of 244 strains were isolated and studied for identifying characteristics. Of the total, only 87 (35.5%) could be identified serologically by a battery of 67 antisera; only 4 (1.6%) possessed the characteristics of the English "food-poisoning type." The hemolytic activity on agar containing horse, ox, or sheep blood showed that 140 (57.1%) were "hemolytic," 81 (33.1%) were "nonhemolytic," and 23 (9.8%) gave varied results. Only 12 (4.9%) of the strains produced spores that resisted boiling for 30 min or more.

AB  - 1. alpha-[U-(14)C]Linolenic acid was incubated with the rumen contents of sheep and the metabolic products were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography and absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared. 2. A tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. The main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. Washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. Pure cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.

Bacteriol. 89:47-51. 1965.-Differential bacterial counts of feces and total plasma cholesterol determinations were performed on 60 Wistar rats fed several high lipid diets for a period of approximately 6 months. Fecal flora remained relatively stable irrespective of diet, but cholesterol levels rose in animals fed butter and sodium cholate. The six most commonly cultured organisms in all diets were enterococci, Proteus, lactobacilli, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and other micrococci. No enteric pathogens which did not ferment lactose or fermented it slowly were grown. Fungi and yeasts were rare. Aerobes generally outnumbered anaerobes in proportions which were sometimes as high as 300:1. Clostridium perfringens isolations were consistently high in animals given the butter diets, particularly when sodium cholate was added. Evidence is reviewed which indicates that this organism may play a role in bile salt and cholesterol metabolism. This experiment would seem to demonstrate that differences in plasma-cholesterol levels among the various dietary groups of rats were the result of dietary factors rather than alteration in intestinal flora.

J. Bacteriol. 87:623-629. 1964.-Earlier studies indicated that death of goats with traumatic wounds of the hindquarter could be related to the number of clostridia in the wounds, and that toxicity of wound exudates for mice and guinea pigs could be partially neutralized by commercial trivalent gas gangrene antitoxin. This report describes in vitro and in vivo analyses of wound exudates for known clostridial toxins. Wounds were produced by detonation of high-explosive pellets. Wound exudates were obtained by cold saline extraction of both necrotic tissues and gauze sponges used to cover the wounds. Exudates were sterilized by Seitz filtration in the cold. In vitro tests were used to measure alpha-, theta-, and mu-toxins of Clostridium perfringens and the epsilon-toxin of C. novyi. Mouse protection tests, employing commercial typing antisera, were used to analyze exudates for other clostridial toxins. Lethality of wound exudates for mice could be related to (i) the numbers of clostridia present in the wound, (ii) survival time of the goats, and (iii) positive lecithovitellin (LV) tests of the exudates. However, the LV tests could not be neutralized by antitoxin specific for C. perfringens alpha-toxin. Mice were not protected by typing antisera specific for types A, C, or D C. perfringens or C. septicum but were protected by antisera specific for type B C. perfringens and types A and B C. novyi.
