TI  == short communication: evaluation of the microbiota of kefir samples using metagenetic analysis targeting the 16s and 26s ribosomal dna fragments.
AB  == milk kefir is produced by fermenting milk in the presence of kefir grains. this beverage has several benefits for human health. the aim of this experiment was to analyze 5 kefir grains (and their products) using a targeted metagenetic approach. of the 5 kefir grains analyzed, 1 was purchased in a supermarket, 2 were provided by the ministry of agriculture (namur, belgium), and 2 were provided by individuals. the metagenetic approach targeted the v1-v3 fragment of  the 16s ribosomal (r)dna for the grains and the resulting beverages at 2 levels of grain incorporation (5 and 10%) to identify the bacterial species population.  in contrast, the 26s rdna pyrosequencing was performed only on kefir grains with  the aim of assessing the yeast populations. in parallel, ph measurements were performed on the kefir obtained from the kefir grains using 2 incorporation rates. regarding the bacterial population, 16s pyrosequencing revealed the presence of 20 main bacterial species, with a dominance of the following: lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, gluconobacter frateurii, lactobacillus kefiri, acetobacter orientalis, and acetobacter lovaniensis. an important difference was noticed between the kefir samples: kefir grain purchased from a supermarket (sample e) harbored a much higher proportion of several operational taxonomic units of lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides. this sample of grain was macroscopically different from the others in terms of size, apparent cohesion of the grains, structure, and texture, probably associated with a lower level of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. the kefir (at an incorporation rate of 5%) produced from this sample of grain was characterized by a lower ph value (4.5) than the others. the other 4 samples of kefir (5%) had ph values above 5. comparing the kefir grain and the kefir, an increase in the population of gluconobacter in grain sample b was observed. this  was also the case for acetobacter orientalis in sample d. in relation to 26s pyrosequencing, our study revealed the presence of 3 main yeast species: naumovozyma spp., kluyveromyces marxianus, and kazachastania khefir. for naumovozyma, further studies are needed to assess the isolation of new species. in conclusion, this study has proved that it is possible to establish the patterns of bacterial and yeast composition of kefir and kefir grain. this was only achieved with the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques.

TI  == selection of lactic acid bacteria from brazilian kefir grains for potential use as starter or probiotic cultures.
AB  == brazilian kefir is a homemade fermented beverage that is obtained by incubating milk or a brown sugar solution with kefir grains that contribute their different  microbiological compositions. it is highly important to isolate and characterize  microorganisms from brazilian kefir grains to obtain starter cultures for the industrial production of a standardized commercial kefir. thus, the present study aimed to isolate lactic acid bacteria from eight kefir grains that were propagated in milk or sugar solutions from five different locations in brazil and to select lactobacillus isolates based on desirable in vitro probiotic properties. one hundred eight isolates from both substrates were identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and/or 16s rrna gene sequencing and  were determined to belong to the following 11 species from the genera: lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus (l.), and oenococcus. leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens were isolated only from milk grains, whereas lactobacillus perolens, lactobacillus parafarraginis, lactobacillus diolivorans, and oenococcus oeni were isolated exclusively from sugar water grains. when the microbial compositions of four kefir grains were evaluated with culture-independent analyses, l. kefiranofaciens was observed to predominant in milk grains, whereas lactobacillus hilgardii was most abundant in sugar water kefir. unfortunately, l. hilgardii was not isolated  from any grain, although this bacteria was detected with a culture-independent methodology. fifty-two isolated lactobacilli were tested for gastric juice and bile salt tolerance, antagonism against pathogens, antimicrobial resistance, and  surface hydrophobicity. three lactobacillus strains (l. kefiranofaciens 8u, l. diolivorans 1z, and lactobacillus casei 17u) could be classified as potential probiotics. in conclusion, several lactic acid bacteria that could be used in combination with yeasts as starter cultures for both milk kefir and sugar water kefir were characterized, and the functional properties of several of the lactobacilli isolated from the kefir grains were suggestive of their possible use as probiotics in both kefir and other dairy products.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of brazilian kefir during fermentation and storage processes.
AB  == the microbial community composition and chemical characteristics of a brazilian milk kefir sample produced during its manufacturing and refrigerated storage were investigated by culture-dependent and -independent methods and hplc. lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, acetobacter lovaniensis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated, whereas the detected bands on denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis corresponded to lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus parakefiri, and s. cerevisiae. after fermentation, lactic acid bacteria were present at levels of 10 log units, whereas acetic acid bacteria and yeast were present at levels of 7.8 and 6 log units, respectively. the lactic acid bacteria and yeast counts remained constant, whereas acetic acid bacteria counts decreased to 7.2 log units during storage. from fermentation to final storage, the ph, lactose content and citric acid of the kefir beverage decreased, followed by an increase in the concentrations of glucose, galactose, ethanol, and lactic, acetic, butyric, and propionic acids. these microbiological and chemical characteristics contribute to the unique taste and aroma of kefir. this research may serve as a basis for the future industrial production of this beverage in brazil.

TI  == determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. in the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis of the 16s rrna gene v3 region. among these species, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while lactococcus  lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. in the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16s rdna full-length sequencing. according to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were l. lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. only 3 species, which are  l. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. this study  showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. practical application: due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. for this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions  of turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular  methods.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == analysis of the microflora in tibetan kefir grains using denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis.
AB  == the microflora of tibetan kefir grains was investigated by culture- independent methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partially amplified 16s rrna for bacteria and 26s rrna for yeasts, followed by sequencing of the most intense bands, showed that the dominant microorganisms were pseudomonas sp., leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus casei, kazachstania unispora, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and kazachstania exigua. the bacterial communities between three kinds of tibetan kefir grains showed 78-84% similarity, and yeasts 80-92%. the microflora is held  together in the matrix of fibrillar material composed largely of a water-insoluble polysaccharide.

TI  == microbiological and chemical properties of kefir manufactured by entrapped microorganisms isolated from kefir grains.
AB  == in this study, various yeasts (kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces turicensis, pichia fermentans) and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus kefiri, leuconostoc mesenteroides) were entrapped in 2 different microspheres using an entrapment ratio for the strains that was based on the distribution ratio of these organisms in kefir grains. the purpose of this study  was to develop a new technique to produce kefir using immobilized starter cultures isolated from kefir grains. an increase in cell counts with fermentation cycles was observed for both the lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts, whereas the cell counts of kefir grains were very stable during cultivation. scanning electron microscopy showed that the short-chain lactobacilli and lactococci occupied the surface of the lab microspheres, whereas the long-chain lactobacilli were inside the microspheres. when the yeasts were analyzed, cells at a high density were entrapped in cracks on the surface and within the microspheres, where they were surrounded by the short-chain lactobacilli. the distribution of the lab and yeast species in kefir produced from grains and microspheres showed that there was no significant difference between the kefirs produced by the 2 methods; moreover, leu. mesenteroides and k. marxianus were the predominating microflora in both types of kefir. there was no significant difference in the ethanol and exopolysaccharide contents between the 2 kefirs, although the acidity was different.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid bacteria in kefir grains by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) in different original kefir grains were first assessed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) by a culture-dependent way, and were further confirmed by dna sequencing techniques. results indicated that a combined method of cultivation with pcr-dgge and subsequent dna sequencing could successfully identify four lab  strains from three kefir grains from taiwan (named hsinchu, mongolia and ilan). lactobacillus kefiri accounted, in the three kefir grains, for at least half of the isolated colonies while lb. kefiranofaciens was the second most frequently isolated species. leuconostoc mesenteroides was less frequently found but still in the three kefir grains conversely to lactococcus lactis which based on culture-dependent isolation was only found in two of the kefir grains. it was interesting to find that all three kefir grains contain similar lab species. furthermore, the dgge as a culture-independent method was also applied to detect  the lab strains. results indicated that lb. kefiranofaciens was found in all three kefir grains, whereas lb. kefiri was only observed in hsinchu kefir grain and lc. lactis was found in both mongolia and ilan samples. two additional strains, pseudomonas spp. and e. coli, were also detected in kefir grains.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria within the consortium of a kefir grain by  sequencing 16s rdna variable regions.
AB  == the microflora of a kefir grain was identified using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy combined with 16s rrna gene sequencing. dna was extracted from the kefir grain and amplified in its 16s rdna v1 and v2 regions. to guarantee a good representation of the overall lactic acid bacteria populations,  dna amplification was performed separately with primers specific either to the dominant or to the less abundant bacterial groups. the amplified fragments were cloned in escherichia coli and then sequenced. sequences of the v1 region were gathered into 5 groups of similarity and identified by aligning with the sequences of a public library. the v1 region allowed the identification of lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, l. kefir, l. parakefir, and lactococcus lactis but was inappropriate for the identification of leuconostocs at species level. among  16s rdna variable regions, the v2 region showed the highest variability between leuconostoc species. nevertheless, even in the v2 region, differences were too tenuous for effective identification of l. mesenteroides. the methodology described here allowed detection of the dominant species within each targeted microbial group.

TI  == polyphasic characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in kefir.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria of kefir were isolated and characterized using phenotypical, biochemical, and genotypical methods. polyphasic analyses of results permitted the identification of the microflora to the strain level. the genus lactobacillus was represented by the species lb. kefir and lb. kefiranofaciens. both subspecies of lactococcus lactis (lactis and cremoris) were isolated. leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris was also found. the kefir studied contained few species of lactic acid bacteria but showed a high number of different strains. we found that the polyphasic analysis approach increases the confidence in strain determination. it helped confirm strain groupings and it showed that it could have an impact on the phylogeny of the strains.
