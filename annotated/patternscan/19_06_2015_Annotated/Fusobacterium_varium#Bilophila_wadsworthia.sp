TI  == [application of "microring an" to "level 1": presumptive identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == commonly isolated anaerobic gram-negative rods (4 genus 64 strains), some other important gram-negative anaerobic species (9 genus 45 strains), and cigar-shaped  clostridia (11 strains) were studied on their susceptibility patterns to 6 agents on "microring an". some modifications were made in the methods and interpretation of results. susceptibility patterns to erythromycin, rifampicin, colistin, benzylpenicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin were following (sensitive [s], intermediate [i], resistant [r], variable [v]): for bacteroides fragilis group, v, s, r, r, r, r, respectively; for non-pigmented prevotella, v, s, v, v, r, r, respectively; for pigmented prevotella, s, s, sr, v, v, r, respectively: for fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, r(s), s(i), s(ir), s(r), s, r, respectively; and for f. varium, r, r, s/i, r(s), s, r, respectively. some results were different from that in the data table in the instruction of "microring an", because of differences of methodology and changes of susceptibility of those species during years. as to the other groups, that are not included in the data table in the instruction, results were following: for bilophila wadsworthia, r, r, s, r, s, r, respectively; desulfovibrio, v, r(s), r, r, s, r, respectively; for cigar-shaped clostridia, v, s(r), r, r, s(r), s, respectively. "microring an" was useful for presumptive identification in genus, species, or group level, though morphological observation and some additional simple tests such as bile-sensitivity and catalase were essential.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli in europe.
AB  == objective: to investigate the in vitro activity of a range of anti-anaerobe antimicrobials against non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated in europe. methods: isolates from 15 laboratories in 13 countries were identified by conventional methods. the mics of 20 antibiotics were determined by an agar dilution method. results: there were 488 prevotella spp., 174 fusobacteria, 69 porphyromonas spp., 33 bacteroides spp., 28 bilophila  wadsworthia and 16 campylobacter spp. isolates, one sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and four unidentified isolates. penicillin resistance (and diminished susceptibility to piperacillin) was most common in prevotella spp. and bilophila  wadsworthia but was also seen in many other species. all isolates, except three of bilophila wadsworthia, were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate. most isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin (except bilophila wadsworthia) and all were susceptible to the carbapenems. clinafloxacin was the most active quinolone, followed by trovafloxacin and then sparfloxacin. most fusobacteria were inherently resistant to the macrolides, as expected, but resistance to macrolides and a ketolide in other species was uncommon. most fusobacterium varium isolates  were resistant to clindamycin, but resistance to clindamycin in all other species was rare. tetracycline resistance was common but this did not affect the glycylcyclines. there was one isolate of bacteroides putredinis resistant to chloramphenicol, and three isolates, a bacteroides ureolyticus isolate, the sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and one of the unnamed isolates, were metronidazole resistant. rifampicin was active against most prevotella and porphyromonas spp., but not against many other genera. conclusions: penicillin resistance has increased in europe among non-bacteroides fragilis anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, much of it due to beta-lactamase. acquired resistance to other beta-lactams, macrolides and rifampicin has not significantly increased, and chloramphenicol and metronidazole are unaffected. however, resistance to tetracycline is common. the new compounds, a ketolide (hmr 3647), the glycylcyclines and clinafloxacin, are highly active.

TI  == in vitro activity of telithromycin (hmr 3647) against 502 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in a previous study, we compared hmr 3004 with azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin against 502 anaerobic bacteria using nccls-approved procedures. this report extends this study by reporting the activity of telithromycin (hmr 3647) against these strains. telithromycin inhibited 10% of bacteroides fragilis, 50% of other b. fragilis group organisms and 93% of other bacteroides spp. telithromycin inhibited all porphyromonas spp.  and 98% of prevotella spp. activity against bilophila wadsworthia (85-96%) was excellent. telithromycin was not active against the fusobacterium mortiferum/varium group. telithromycin inhibited 100% of clostridium perfringens, 46-56% of clostridium difficile and clostridium ramosum and approximately 90% of  non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == in vitro activity of du-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of a new quinolone agent, du-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of du-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin,  metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. du-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every  group of organisms. mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis (57), other b. fragilis group species (84), bilophila wadsworthia (15), clostridium species (27) (including c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum), fusobacterium nucleatum (16), fusobacterium mortiferum-f. varium group species (10), peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and prevotella species (25).

TI  == inactivation of anaerobic bacteria by various photosensitized porphyrins or by hemin.
AB  == the photodynamic effects of deuteroporphyrin (dp), hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd), hematoporphyrin (hp), or protoporphyrin (pp) on a variety of anaerobic microorganisms were examined in this study. the majority of the species, among the 350 strains tested, were inhibited by concentrations of < or = 2.5 micrograms/ml of light-activated dp. species found to be resistant to this treatment included bilophila wadsworthia, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium, and bacteroides gracilis. these species were inhibited by concentrations  of > 60 micrograms/ml of dp. the porphyrin-producing species, porphyromonas and prevotella spp, were all inhibited by < or = 2.5 micrograms/ml dp and light. comparing the photodynamic activity of the porphyrins used on porphyromonas strains resulted in the following pattern: dp > hpd > hp > pp. porphyromonas spp., gram-positive cocci, and many gram-positive rods (excluding clostridia) were inactivated by hemin (a metal-containing porphyrin) at 10-20 micrograms/ml.  hemin inhibitory action was not affected by light. binding and insertion of dp into bacteria (both inactivated and non-inactivated strains by dp and light) were monitored by the characteristic fluorescence band of bound dp at 622 nm. porphyromonas spp. bound dp tightly, whereas only low binding was seen with b. wadsworthia and other dp-resistant species. high binding of dp to b. wadsworthia  can be achieved by pretreatment of the bacteria with imipenem or cefoxitin, beta-lactam agents known to interfere with the integrity of the cell wall. if cell wall integrity is disturbed (e.g., by these agents), inactivation of b. wadsworthia by dp can occur.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.
