TI  == xenorhabdus bovienii strain diversity impacts coevolution and symbiotic maintenance with steinernema spp. nematode hosts.
AB  == microbial symbionts provide benefits that contribute to the ecology and fitness of host plants and animals. therefore, the evolutionary success of plants and animals fundamentally depends on long-term maintenance of beneficial associations. most work investigating coevolution and symbiotic maintenance has focused on species-level associations, and studies are lacking that assess the impact of bacterial strain diversity on symbiotic associations within a coevolutionary framework. here, we demonstrate that fitness in mutualism varies depending on bacterial strain identity, and this is consistent with variation shaping phylogenetic patterns and maintenance through fitness benefits. through genome sequencing of nine bacterial symbiont strains and cophylogenetic analysis, we demonstrate diversity among xenorhabdus bovienii bacteria. further, we identified cocladogenesis between steinernema feltiae nematode hosts and their corresponding x. bovienii symbiont strains, indicating potential specificity within the association. to test the specificity, we performed laboratory crosses  of nematode hosts with native and nonnative symbiont strains, which revealed that combinations with the native bacterial symbiont and closely related strains performed significantly better than those with more divergent symbionts. through  genomic analyses we also defined potential factors contributing to specificity between nematode hosts and bacterial symbionts. these results suggest that strain-level diversity (e.g., subspecies-level differences) in microbial symbionts can drive variation in the success of host-microbe associations, and this suggests that these differences in symbiotic success could contribute to maintenance of the symbiosis over an evolutionary time scale. importance: beneficial symbioses between microbes and plant or animal hosts are ubiquitous, and in these associations, microbial symbionts provide key benefits to their hosts. as such, host success is fundamentally dependent on long-term maintenance  of beneficial associations. prolonged association between partners in evolutionary time is expected to result in interactions in which only specific partners can fully support symbiosis. the contribution of bacterial strain diversity on specificity and coevolution in a beneficial symbiosis remains unclear. in this study, we demonstrate that strain-level differences in fitness benefits occur in beneficial host-microbe interactions, and this variation likely shapes phylogenetic patterns and symbiotic maintenance. this highlights that symbiont contributions to host biology can vary significantly based on very-fine-scale differences among members of a microbial species. further, this work emphasizes the need for greater phylogenetic resolution when considering the causes and consequences of host-microbe interactions.

TI  == evaluation of entomopathogenic nematodes and the supernatants of the in vitro culture medium of their mutualistic bacteria for the control of the root-knot nematodes meloidogyne incognita and m. arenaria.
AB  == background: the suppressive effects of various formulations of four entomopathogenic nematode (epn) species and the supernatants of their mutualistic bacteria on the root-knot nematodes (rkns) meloidogyne incognita and m. arenaria  in tomato roots were evaluated. the epns steinernema carpocapsae, s. feltiae, s.  glaseri and heterorhabditis bacteriophora were applied as either live infective juveniles (ijs) or infected insect cadavers. spent medium from culturing the bacterial symbionts xenorhabdus bovienii and photorhabdus luminescens kayaii with the cells removed was also applied without their nematode partners. results: the  aqueous suspensions of ijs, infected cadaver applications of epns and especially  treatments of x. bovienii supernatant suppressed the negative impact of rkns on tomatoes. specific responses to treatment were reduced rkn egg masses, increased  plant height and increased fresh and dry weights compared with the control where  only rkns were applied. conclusion: among the treatments tested, the plant-dipping method of x. bovienii into bacterial culture fluid may be the most  practical and effective method for m. incognita and m. arenaria control.

TI  == xenorhabdus bovienii cs03, the bacterial symbiont of the entomopathogenic nematode steinernema weiseri, is a non-virulent strain against lepidopteran insects.
AB  == xenorhabdus bacteria (gamma-proteobacteria: enterobacteriaceae) have dual lifestyles. they have a mutualistic relationship with steinernema nematodes (nematoda: steinernematidae) and are pathogenic to a wide range of insects. each  steinernema nematode associates with a specific xenorhabdus species. however, a xenorhabdus species can have multiple nematode hosts. for example, xenorhabdus bovienii (xb) colonizes at least nine steinernema species from two different phylogenetic clades. the steinernema-xb partnership has been found in association with different insect hosts. biological and molecular data on the steinernema jollieti-xb strain ss-2004 pair have recently been described. in particular, the  xb ss-2004 bacteria are virulent alone after direct injection into insect, making this strain a model for studying xb virulence. in this study, we searched for xb  strains attenuated in virulence. for this purpose, we underwent infection assays  with five steinernema spp.-xb pairs with two insects, galleria mellonella (lepidoptera: pyralidae) and spodoptera littoralis (lepidoptera: noctuidae). the  s. weiseri-xb cs03 pair showed attenuated virulence and lower fitness in s. littoralis in comparison to the other nematode-bacteria pairs. furthermore, when  injected alone into the hemolymph of g. mellonella or s. littoralis, the xb cs03  bacterial strain was the only non-virulent strain. by comparison with the virulent xb ss-2004 strain, xb cs03 showed an increased sensitivity to the insect antimicrobial peptides, suggesting an attenuated response to the insect humoral immunity. to our current knowledge, xb cs03 is the first non-virulent xb strain identified. we propose this strain as a new model for studying the xenorhabdus virulence.

TI  == biosynthesis of the insecticidal xenocyloins in xenorhabdus bovienii.
AB  == the biosynthesis gene cluster for the production of xenocyloins was identified in the entomopathogenic bacterium xenorhabdus bovienii ss-2004, and their biosynthesis was elucidated by heterologous expression and in vitro characterization of the enzymes. xcla is an s-selective thdp-dependent acyloin-like condensation enzyme, and xclb and xclc are examples of the still-rare acylating ketosynthases that catalyze the acylation of the xcla-derived initial xenocyloins with acetyl-, propionyl-, or malonyl-coa, thereby resulting in the formation of further xenocyloin derivatives. all xenocyloins were produced mainly by the more virulent primary variant of x. bovienii and showed activity against insect hemocytes thus contributing to the overall virulence of x. bovienii against insects.

TI  == effects of a protease inhibitor protein from xenorhabdus bovienii on physiology of pea aphid (acyrthosiphon pisum).
AB  == the effects of a protease inhibitor protein from xenorhabdus bovienii strain xbi1 (xbpi-1) on biochemistry and physiology of pea aphid (acyrthosiphon pisum) were studied, and the effects of xbpi-1 on the activities of aphid aminopeptidase and  the concentrations of carbohydrates, free amino acids and lipids in a. pisum were determined. the results showed that the activity of aminopeptidase was reduced 18.30% by xbpi-1 in vitro assays. in addition, the total sugar, glycogen, and lipid concentrations per aphid fed on an artificial diet with xbpi-1 were reduced by 39.41%, 24.61% and 26.25%, respectively, compared to the controls. the total free amino acids in the aphids on the diet with xbpi-1 was significantly decreased by 20.78% compared to the control. the mortalities of a. pisum were significantly higher when the concentrations of xbpi-1 were 400 and 800 mug/ml in the artificial diet. the results from this study indicated that xbpi-1 had adverse effects on the physiology and biochemistry of a. pisum.

TI  == bacteriocin-mediated interactions within and between coexisting species.
AB  == bacteriocins are bacteriocidal toxins released by almost all bacteria. they are thought to have a narrow range of killing, but as bacteriocin-mediated interactions have been rarely studied at biologically relevant scales, whether this narrow range of action falls mostly within or mostly between coexisting species in natural communities is an open question with important ecological and  evolutionary implications. in a previous study, we systematically sampled xenorhabdus bacteria along a hillside and found evidence for genotypic variability and bacteriocin-mediated interactions within xenorhabdus bovienii and x. koppenhoeferi colonies that were collected only a few meters apart. in contrast, colonies that were isolated from the same soil sample were always genetically similar and showed no inhibitions. here, we conducted pairwise growth-inhibition assays within and between seven x. bovienii and five x. koppenhoeferi colonies that were isolated from different soil samples; all seven  x. bovienii colonies and at least three of the x. koppenhoeferi have been distinguished as distinct genotypes based on coarse-grain genomic markers. we found signatures for both conspecific and heterospecific bacteriocin inhibitions  in this natural community of xenorhabdus bacteria, but intraspecific inhibitions  were significantly more common than interspecific inhibitions. these results suggest that bacteriocins have a major role in intraspecific competition in nature, but also suggest that bacterocins are important in mediating interspecific interactions among coexisting species in natural communities.

TI  == [an idp16 protein from xenorhabdus bovienii depresses the immune response in galleria mellonella].
AB  == objective: a protein with insect immunodepressive activity was purified from xenorhabdus bovienii, a bacterial symbiosis of entomopathogenic nematode. to determine the function of this protein in the pathogenesis of bacterium-nematode  symbiosis, we detected the effect of this protein on immune response in galleria  mellonella. methods: proteins from extracellular extact of x. bovienii were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, hitrap q hp chromatography, hitrap butyl ff chromatography, and hitrap sp hp chromatography. intra-hemocoel injection assay followed by observation of hemolymph melanization was used for activity determination. fluorescent microspheres and sepharose beads were used to assess the effect of purified protein on phagocytosis and encapsulation of hemocytes, respectively. the purified protein was identified by 2-d and ms anlysis. the full-length encoding gene was cloned by pcr, and expressed with pet  30a in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein was purified by ni-nta affinity  chromatography. results: an immunodepressive protein was purified and designed as idp16, which can inhibit the phenoloxidase activity, and weaken the phagocytosis  and encapsulation of galleria mellonella hemocytes. the encoding gene was then cloned and expressed in e. coli. the recombinant protein was also determined to be immunodepressive. conclusion: the idp16 protein from xenorhabdus bovienii can  depress the immune response in insect, which may play an important role in bacteria-host interaction.

TI  == statistical optimization of process variables for antibiotic activity of xenorhabdus bovienii.
AB  == the production of secondary metabolites with antibiotic properties is a common characteristic to entomopathogenic bacteria xenorhabdus spp. these metabolites not only have diverse chemical structures but also have a wide range of bioactivities of medicinal and agricultural interests. culture variables are critical to the production of secondary metabolites of microorganisms. manipulating culture process variables can promote secondary metabolite biosynthesis and thus facilitate the discovery of novel natural products. this work was conducted to evaluate the effects of five process variables (initial ph, medium volume, rotary speed, temperature, and inoculation volume) on the antibiotic production of xenorhabdus bovienii yl002 using response surface methodology. a 2(5-1) factorial central composite design was chosen to determine  the combined effects of the five variables, and to design a minimum number of experiments. the experimental and predicted antibiotic activity of x. bovienii yl002 was in close agreement. statistical analysis of the results showed that initial ph, medium volume, rotary speed and temperature had a significant effect  (p<0.05) on the antibiotic production of x. bovienii yl002 at their individual level; medium volume and rotary speed showed a significant effect at a combined level and was most significant at an individual level. the maximum antibiotic activity (287.5 u/ml) was achieved at the initial ph of 8.24, medium volume of 54 ml in 250 ml flask, rotary speed of 208 rpm, temperature of 32.0 degrees c and inoculation volume of 13.8%. after optimization, the antibiotic activity was improved by 23.02% as compared with that of unoptimized conditions.

TI  == comparative analysis of p2-type remnant prophage loci in xenorhabdus bovienii and xenorhabdus nematophila required for xenorhabdicin production.
AB  == the xnp1 remnant p2-type prophage of xenorhabdus nematophila produces xenorhabdicin that is active against closely related species. xenorhabdicin had not been characterized previously in other xenorhabdus species. here, we show xenorhabdicin production in six different strains of xenorhabdus bovienii. the sequenced genome of x. bovienii ss-2004 was found to possess a highly conserved remnant p2-type cluster (xbp1). inactivation of the xbps1 sheath gene resulted in loss of bacteriocin activity, indicating that the xbp1 locus was required for xenorhabdicin production. xbp1 and xnp1 contain a ci-type repressor, a dini gene  involved in stabilization of ssdna-reca complexes and are inducible with mitomycin c, suggesting that both loci are regulated by cleavage of the ci repressor. both xnp1 and xbp1 lack typical p2-type lysis genes but contain a predicted endolysin gene (enp) that may be involved in cell lysis. the main tail  fibers of xnp1 and xbp1 are mosaic structures with divergent c-terminal regions suggesting they differ in host specificity. several genes encoding c-terminal tail fiber fragments are present in the same position in xnp1 and xbp1. recombination between the main fiber genes and the c-terminal fragments could potentially expand the host range specificity of xenorhabdicin in the respective  strains.

TI  == a new gene from xenorhabdus bovienii and its encoded protease inhibitor protein against acyrthosiphon pisum.
AB  == background: aphids are insect pests with significant importance worldwide for agricultural and horticultural crops. the chemical pesticides used to control aphids could result in pesticide residues in agricultural and horticultural products as well as in negative effects on the environment. therefore, alternative control methods are urgently needed. this study identified a new gene from strain bjfs526 of the symbiotic bacterium xenorhabdus bovienii and expressed the protease inhibitor protein encoded by the gene. the effects of the protein on the pea aphids, acyrthosiphon pisum, were also investigated. results: the gene pin1 encoding the protease inhibitor protein against aphids was successfully cloned from bjfs526. the study demonstrated that the protein had adverse effects  on pea aphid survival, and that the activity of aphid aminopeptidase was significantly inhibited by the protein. conclusion: the results from this study suggest that this gene and the protease inhibitor protein encoded may offer an alternative method to control aphids in the future.

TI  == spiteful interactions between sympatric natural isolates of xenorhabdus bovienii  benefit kin and reduce virulence.
AB  == spite occurs when an individual harms itself in the act of harming others. spiteful behaviour may be more pervasive in nature than commonly thought. one of  the clearest examples of spite is the costly production and release of bacteriocins, antimicrobial toxins noted for their ability to kill conspecifics.  a key question is to what extent these toxins provide a fitness advantage to kin  of the producer cell, especially in natural communities. additionally, when bacteria are involved in parasitic relationships, spiteful interactions are predicted to lower bacterial densities within a host, causing a reduction in parasite-induced virulence. using five sympatric, field-collected genotypes of the insect pathogen xenorhabdus bovienii, we experimentally demonstrate that bacteriocin production benefits kin within the host, and that it slows the mortality rate of the host. these results confirm that spite among naturally coexisting bacterial clones can be a successful kin-selected strategy that has emergent effects on virulence.

TI  == phenotypic variation and host interactions of xenorhabdus bovienii ss-2004, the entomopathogenic symbiont of steinernema jollieti nematodes.
AB  == xenorhabdus bovienii (ss-2004) bacteria reside in the intestine of the infective-juvenile (ij) stage of the entomopathogenic nematode, steinernema jollieti. the recent sequencing of the x. bovienii genome facilitates its use as  a model to understand host - symbiont interactions. to provide a biological foundation for such studies, we characterized x. bovienii in vitro and host interaction phenotypes. within the nematode host x. bovienii was contained within a membrane bound envelope that also enclosed the nematode-derived intravesicular  structure. steinernema jollieti nematodes cultivated on mixed lawns of x. bovienii expressing green or dsred fluorescent proteins were predominantly colonized by one or the other strain, suggesting the colonizing population is founded by a few cells. xenorhabdus bovienii exhibits phenotypic variation between orange-pigmented primary form and cream-pigmented secondary form. each form can colonize ij nematodes when cultured in vitro on agar. however, ijs did not develop or emerge from galleria mellonella insects infected with secondary form. unlike primary-form infected insects that were soft and flexible, secondary-form infected insects retained a rigid exoskeleton structure. xenorhabdus bovienii primary and secondary form isolates are virulent towards manduca sexta and several other insects. however, primary form stocks present attenuated virulence, suggesting that x. bovienii, like xenorhabdus nematophila may undergo virulence modulation.

TI  == the entomopathogenic bacterial endosymbionts xenorhabdus and photorhabdus: convergent lifestyles from divergent genomes.
AB  == members of the genus xenorhabdus are entomopathogenic bacteria that associate with nematodes. the nematode-bacteria pair infects and kills insects, with both partners contributing to insect pathogenesis and the bacteria providing nutrition to the nematode from available insect-derived nutrients. the nematode provides the bacteria with protection from predators, access to nutrients, and a mechanism of dispersal. members of the bacterial genus photorhabdus also associate with nematodes to kill insects, and both genera of bacteria provide similar services to their different nematode hosts through unique physiological and metabolic mechanisms. we posited that these differences would be reflected in their respective genomes. to test this, we sequenced to completion the genomes of xenorhabdus nematophila atcc 19061 and xenorhabdus bovienii ss-2004. as expected, both xenorhabdus genomes encode many anti-insecticidal compounds, commensurate with their entomopathogenic lifestyle. despite the similarities in lifestyle between xenorhabdus and photorhabdus bacteria, a comparative analysis of the xenorhabdus, photorhabdus luminescens, and p. asymbiotica genomes suggests genomic divergence. these findings indicate that evolutionary changes shaped by symbiotic interactions can follow different routes to achieve similar end points.

TI  == improvement of antibiotic activity of xenorhabdus bovienii by medium optimization using response surface methodology.
AB  == background: the production of secondary metabolites with antibiotic properties is a common characteristic to entomopathogenic bacteria xenorhabdus spp. these metabolites not only have diverse chemical structures but also have a wide range  of bioactivities with medicinal and agricultural interests such as antibiotic, antimycotic and insecticidal, nematicidal and antiulcer, antineoplastic and antiviral. it has been known that cultivation parameters are critical to the secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms. even small changes in the culture medium may not only impact the quantity of certain compounds but also the general metabolic profile of microorganisms. manipulating nutritional or environmental factors can promote the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and thus facilitate the discovery of new natural products. this work was conducted to evaluate the influence of nutrition on the antibiotic production of x. bovienii yl002 and to optimize the medium to maximize its antibiotic production. results:  nutrition has high influence on the antibiotic production of x. bovienii yl002. glycerol and soytone were identified as the best carbon and nitrogen sources that significantly affected the antibiotic production using one-factor-at-a-time approach. response surface methodology (rsm) was applied to optimize the medium constituents (glycerol, soytone and minerals) for the antibiotic production of x. bovienii yl002. higher antibiotic activity (337.5 u/ml) was obtained after optimization. the optimal levels of medium components were (g/l): glycerol 6.90,  soytone 25.17, mgso4.7h2o 1.57, (nh4)2so4 2.55, kh2po4 0.87, k2hpo4 1.11 and na2so4 1.81. an overall of 37.8% increase in the antibiotic activity of x. bovienii yl002 was obtained compared with that of the original medium. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on antibiotic production of x. boviebii by medium optimization using rsm. the results strongly  support the use of rsm for medium optimization. the optimized medium not only resulted in a 37.8% increase of antibiotic activity, but also reduced the numbers of experiments. the chosen method of medium optimization was efficient, simple and less time consuming. this work will be useful for the development of x. bovienii cultivation process for efficient antibiotic production on a large scale, and for the development of more advanced control strategies on plant diseases.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of xenorhabdus bovienii yl002 against phytophthora capsici and botrytis cinerea.
AB  == aims: developing new bio-agents to control plant disease is desirable. entomopathogenic bacteria xenorhabdus spp. have potential antimicrobial activity  in agriculture. this work was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of xenorhabdus bovienii yl002 on plant pathogenic fungi and oomycete in vitro and the efficiency of this strain to reduce the in vivo incidence of grey mould rot on tomato plants caused by botrytis cinerea and leaf scorch on pepper plants caused by phytophthora capsici. methods and results: the antimicrobial activity of x. bovienii yl002 was firstly determined on in vitro plant pathogenic fungi and oomycete and then on tomato fruits and plants infected with b. cinerea and pepper plants infected with p. capsici. the cell-free filtrate of x. bovienii yl002 exhibited highest inhibition effects (>98%) on mycelia growth of p. capsici and b. cinerea. the 50% inhibition concentration (ec(5)(0)) of the methanol-extracted bioactive compounds (methanol extract) of the cell-free filtrate against p. capsici and b. cinerea were 164.83 and 42.16 mug ml(-)(1). the methanol extract also had a strong effect on the spore germination of p. capsici and b. cinerea, with a ec(5)(0) of 70.38 and 69.33 mug ml(-)(1), respectively. at 1000 mug ml(-)(1), the methanol extract showed a therapeutic effect of 70.82% and a protective effect of 77.4% against b. cinerea on tomato plants compared with the control. the methanol extract also showed potent effect  against p. capsici, with a therapeutic effect of 68.14% and a protective effect of 65.46% on pepper plants compared with the control. conclusions: xenorhabdus bovienii yl002 produces antimicrobial compounds with strong activity on plant pathogenic fungi and oomycete and has the potential for controlling grey mould rot of tomato plants and leaf scorch of pepper and could be useful in integrated  control against diverse plant pathogenic fungi and oomycete. significance and impact of the study: this study showed the potential that x. bovienii yl002 can be used to control the grey mould rot caused by b. cinerea on tomato plants and leaf scorch caused by p. capsici on pepper plants with the objective to reduce treatments with chemical fungicides.

AB  == a survey of entomopathogenic nematodes in lebanon was conducted for the first time during 2008-2009. samples were collected on the coastal strip and in nine vegetation types extending from the coastal line to 3088m above sea level. wooded and herbaceous ecosystems were considered for sampling purposes. a total of 570 samples were taken, out of which 1% were positive for entomopathogenic nematodes. approximately, 15.8% out of the 19 sites sampled revealed entomopathogenic nematodes presence (representing three samples). two entomopathogenic nematodes species heterorhabditis bacteriophora and steinernema feltiae were recovered, and identification of their symbiotic bacteria revealed the presence of a xenorhabdus bovienii, photorhabdus temperata subsp. thracensis, photorhabdus luminescens subsp. kayaii and photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii.

TI  == metabolically engineered soybean seed with enhanced threonine levels: biochemical characterization and seed-specific expression of lysine-insensitive variants of aspartate kinases from the enteric bacterium xenorhabdus bovienii.
AB  == threonine (thr) is one of a few limiting essential amino acids (eaas) in the animal feed industry, and its level in feed rations can impact production of important meat sources, such as swine and poultry. threonine as well as eaas lysine (lys) and methionine (met) are all synthesized via the aspartate family pathway. here, we report a successful strategy to produce high free threonine soybean seed via identification of a feedback-resistant aspartate kinase (ak) enzyme that can be over-expressed in developing soybean seed. towards this goal,  we have purified and biochemically characterized ak from the enteric bacterium xenorhabdus bovienii (xb). site-directed mutagenesis of xbak identified two key regulatory residues glu-257 and thr-359 involved in lysine inhibition. three feedback-resistant alleles, xbak_t359i, xbak_e257k and xbak_e257k/t359i, have been generated. this study is the first to kinetically characterize the xbak enzyme and provide biochemical and transgenic evidence that glu-257 near the catalytic site is a critical residue for the allosteric regulation of ak. furthermore, seed-specific expression of the feedback-resistant xbak_t359i or xbak_e257k allele results in increases of free thr levels of up to 100-fold in r(1) soybean seed when compared to wild-type. expression of feedback-sensitive wild-type ak did not substantially impact seed thr content. in addition to high thr, transgenic seed also showed substantial increases in other major free amino  acid (faa) levels, resulting in an up to 3.5-fold increase in the total faa content. the transgenic seed was normal in appearance and germinated well under greenhouse conditions.

TI  == spiteful interactions in a natural population of the bacterium xenorhabdus bovienii.
AB  == an individual behaves spitefully when it harms itself in the act of harming other individuals. one of the clearest potential examples of spite is the costly production and release of toxins called bacteriocins. bacteriocins are toxins produced by bacteria that can kill closely related strains of the same species. theoretical work has predicted that bacteriocin-mediated interactions could play  an important role in maintaining local genetic and/or species diversity, but these interactions have not been studied at biologically relevant scales in nature. here we studied toxin production and among-strain inhibitions in a natural population of xenorhabdus bovienii. we found genetic differences and inhibitions between colonies that were collected only a few meters apart. these results suggest that spite exists in natural populations of bacteria.

TI  == manifold aspects of specificity in a nematode-bacterium mutualism.
AB  == coevolution in mutualistic symbiosis can yield, because the interacting partners  share common interests, to coadaptation: hosts perform better when associated with symbionts of their own locality than with others coming from more distant places. however, as the two partners of a symbiosis might also experience conflicts over part of their life cycle, coadaptation might not occur for all life-history traits. we investigated this issue in symbiotic systems where nematodes (steinernema) and bacteria (xenorhabdus) reproduce in insects they have both contributed to kill. newborn infective juveniles (ijs) that carry bacteria in their intestine then disperse from the insect cadaver in search of a new host  to infect. we ran experiments where nematodes coinfect insects with bacteria that differ from their native symbiont. in both steinernema carpocapsae/xenorhabdus nematophila and steinernema feltiae/xenorhabdus bovienii symbioses, we detected an overall specificity which favours the hypothesis of a fine-tuned co-adaptation process. however, we also found that the life-history traits involved in specificity strongly differ between the two model systems: when associated with strains that differ too much from their native symbionts, s. carpocapsae has low  parasitic success, whereas s. feltiae has low survival in dispersal stage.

TI  == characterization of xenorhabdus isolates from la rioja (northern spain) and virulence with and without their symbiotic entomopathogenic nematodes (nematoda:  steinernematidae).
AB  == eighteen xenorhabdus isolates associated with spanish entomopathogenic nematodes  of the genus steinernema were characterized using a polyphasic approach including phenotypic and molecular methods. two isolates were classified as xenorhabdus nematophila and were associated with steinernema carpocapsae. sixteen isolates were classified as xenorhabdus bovienii, of which fifteen were associated with steinernema feltiae and one with steinernema kraussei. two x. bovienii phase ii were also isolated, one instable phase isolated from s. feltiae strain rioja and  one stable phase from s. feltiae strain bz. four representative bacterial isolates were chosen to study their pathogenicity against spodoptera littoralis with and without the presence of their nematode host. the four bacterial isolates were pathogenic for s. littoralis leading to septicemia 24h post-injection and killing around 90% of the insect larvae 36 h post-injection, except for that isolated from s. kraussei. after 48 h of injection, this latter isolate showed a  lower final population in the larval hemolymph (10(7) instead of 10(8)cfu per larvae) and a lower larval mortality (70% instead of 95-100%). the virulence of the nematode-bacteria complexes against s. littoralis showed similar traits with  a significant insect larvae mortality (80-90%) 5 days post-infection except for s. kraussei, although this strain reached similar of larval mortality at 7 days after infection.

AB  == for improvement of mass production of the rhabditid biocontrol nematodes steinernema carpocapsae and steinernema feltiae in monoxenic liquid culture with  their bacterial symbionts xenorhabdus nematophila and xenorhabdus bovienii, respectively, the effect of the initial nematode inoculum density on population development and final concentration of dauer juveniles (djs) was investigated. symbiotic bacterial cultures are pre-incubated for 1 day prior to inoculation of  djs. djs are developmentally arrested and recover development as a reaction to food signals provided by their symbionts. after development to adults, the nematodes produce dj offspring. inoculum density ranged from 1 to 10 x 10(3) dj per milliliter for s. carpocapsae and 1 to 8 x 10(3) djs per milliliter for s. feltiae. no significant influence of the inoculum density on the final dj yields  in both nematode species was recorded, except for s. carpocapsae cultures with a  parental female density <2 x 10(3) djs per milliliter, in which the yields increased with increasing inoculation density. a strong negative response of the  parental female fecundity to increasing dj inoculum densities was recorded for both species with a maximum offspring number per female of >300 for s. carpocapsae and almost 200 for s. feltiae. the compensative adaptation of fecundity to nematode population density is responsible for the lack of an inoculum (or parental female) density effect on dj yields. at optimal inoculation density of s. carpocapsae, offspring were produced by the parental female population, whereas s. feltiae always developed a f1 female population, which contributed to the dj yields and was the reason for a more scattered distribution of the yields. the f1 female generation was accompanied by a second peak in x. bovienii density. the optimal dj inoculum density for s. carpocapsae is 3-6 x 10(3) djs per milliliter in order to obtain >10(3) parental females per milliliter. density-dependent effects were neither observed on the dj recovery nor on the sex ratio in the parental adult generation. as recovery varied between different batches, assessment of the recovery of inoculum dj batches is recommended. s. feltiae was less variable in dj recovery usually reaching >90%. the recommended dj inoculum density is >5 x 10(3) djs per milliliter to reach >2  x 10(3) parental females per milliliter. the mean yield recorded for s. carpocapsae was 135 x 10(3) and 105 x 10(3) per mililiter for s. feltiae.

TI  == effect of temperature on the development of steinernema carpocapsae and steinernema feltiae (nematoda: rhabditida) in liquid culture.
AB  == for commercial use of the entomopathogenic nematodes steinernema carpocapsae and  steinernema feltiae in biological control of insect pests, they are produced in liquid culture on artificial media pre-incubated with their symbiotic bacteria xenorhabdus nematophila and xenorhabdus bovienii, respectively. after 1 day of the bacterial culture, nematode dauer juveniles (djs) are inoculated, which recover development. the adult nematodes produce dj offspring, which are harvested and can be sprayed. this study determined optimal temperatures to obtain high dj progeny within a short process time. temperatures assessed were 23 degrees c, 25 degrees c, 27 degrees c, and 29 degrees c for s. carpocapsae and 20 degrees c, 23 degrees c, 25 degrees c, and 27 degrees c for s. feltiae. the recovery of inoculated djs was hardly affected and was reduced only in s. carpocapsae at 29 degrees c. the fecundity (eggs in uterus) in s. carpocapsae reached a maximum at 27 degrees c; whereas, maximum yields were recorded at 25 degrees c. for both steinernema spp., highest dj densities were obtained after 15 days incubation at 25 degrees c. optimal culture temperature for both nematode species is 25 degrees c. s. carpocapsae was more sensible to suboptimal temperature than s. feltiae. results on total dj density and dj proportion of the total nematode population were more variable at non-optimal temperature condition for s. carpocapsae than for s. feltiae. suboptimal culture temperature also reduced dj infectivity.

TI  == influence of cell density and phase variants of bacterial symbionts (xenorhabdus  spp.) on dauer juvenile recovery and development of biocontrol nematodes steinernema carpocapsae and s. feltiae (nematoda: rhabditida).
AB  == the rhabditid nematodes steinernema carpocapsae and steinernema feltiae are used  in biological control of insect pests. mass production is done in liquid culture  media pre-incubated with their bacterial symbionts xenorhabdus nematophila and xenorhabdus bovienii, respectively, before nematode dauer juveniles (djs) are inoculated. as a response to food signals produced by the bacterial symbionts, the djs exit from the developmentally arrested dauer stage (they recover development) and grow to adults, which produce dj offspring. variable dj recovery after inoculation often causes process failure due to non-synchronous population  development and low numbers of adult nematodes. this contribution investigated the influence of the bacterial cell density on dj recovery and development to adults. at higher density of 10(10) bacterial cells ml(-1), a higher percentage of dj recovery was induced, and adults occurred earlier in both steinernema spp.  than at lower density of 10(9) and 10(8) cells ml(-1). xenorhabdus symbionts produce phase variants. recovery in bacteria-free supernatants was lower than in  supernatants containing bacterial cells for both primary and secondary phase xenorhabdus spp. and lower in secondary than in primary phase supernatants or cell suspensions. in general, recovery was lower for steinernema feltiae and the  time at which 50% of the population had recovered after exposure to the food signal was longer (rt(50) = 17.1 h) than for steinernema carpocapsae (rt(50) = 6.6 h). whereas >90% s. carpocapsae djs recovered in hemolymph serum of the lepidopteran insect galleria mellonella, recovery of s. feltiae only reached 31%. penetration into a host insect prior to exposure to the insect's food signal did  not enhance dj recovery. consequences for liquid culture mass production of the nematodes and differences between species of the genera steinernema and heterorhabditis are discussed.

TI  == isolation and identification of entomopathogenic nematodes and their symbiotic bacteria from herault and gard (southern france).
AB  == isolation and identification of native nematode-bacterial associations in the field are necessary for successful control of endemic pests in a particular location. no study has yet been undertaken to recover and identify epn in metropolitan france. in the present paper, we provide results of a survey of epn  and their symbiotic bacteria conducted in herault and gard regions in southern france. molecular characterization of isolated nematodes depicted three different steinernema species and one heterorhabditis species, h. bacteriophora. steinernema species recovered were identified as: s. feltiae and s. affine and an undescribed species. xenorhabdus symbionts were identified as x. bovienii for both s. feltiae and s. affine. phylogenetic analysis placed the new undescribed steinernema sp. as closely related to s. arenarium but divergent enough to postulate that it belongs to a new species within the "glaseri-group". the xenorhabdus symbiont from this steinernema sp. was identified as x. kozodoii. all heterorhabditis isolates recovered were diagnosed as h. bacteriophora and their bacterial symbionts were identified as photorhabdus luminescens. molecular characterization of these nematodes enabled the distinction of two different h. bacteriophora strains. bacterial symbiontic strains of these two h. bacteriophora strains were identified as p. luminescens ssp. kayaii and p. luminescens ssp. laumondii.

TI  == new insight into diversity in the genus xenorhabdus, including the description of ten novel species.
AB  == we investigated the diversity of a collection of 76 xenorhabdus strains, isolated from at least 27 species of steinernema nematodes and collected in 32 countries,  using three complementary approaches: 16s rrna gene sequencing, molecular typing  and phenotypic characterization. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the xenorhabdus strains were highly conserved (similarity coefficient >95 %), suggesting that the common ancestor of the genus probably emerged between 250 and 500 million years ago. based on comparisons of the 16s rrna gene sequences, we identified 13 groups and seven unique sequences. this classification was confirmed by analysis of molecular typing profiles of the strains, leading to the classification of new isolates into the xenorhabdus species described previously and the description of ten novel xenorhabdus species: xenorhabdus cabanillasii sp. nov. (type strain ustx62(t)=cip 109066(t)=dsm 17905(t)), xenorhabdus doucetiae sp. nov. (type strain frm16(t)=cip 109074(t)=dsm 17909(t)), xenorhabdus griffiniae sp. nov.

(type strain th01(t)=cip 109067(t)=dsm 17904(t)). the xenorhabdus strains studied here had very similar phenotypic patterns, but phenotypic features nonetheless differentiated the following species: x. bovienii, x. cabanillasii, x. hominickii, x. kozodoii, x. nematophila, x. poinarii and x. szentirmaii. based on phenotypic analysis, we identified two major groups of strains. phenotypic group g(a) comprised strains able to grow at temperatures of  35-42 degrees c, whereas phenotypic group g(b) comprised strains that grew at temperatures below 35 degrees c, suggesting that some xenorhabdus species may be  adapted to tropical or temperate regions and/or influenced by the growth and development temperature of their nematode host.

TI  == entomopathogenic nematodes and bacteria applications for control of the pecan root-knot nematode, meloidogyne partityla, in the greenhouse.
AB  == meloidogyne partityla is a parasite of pecan and walnut. our objective was to determine interactions between the entomopathogenic nematode-bacterium complex and m. partityla. specifically, we investigated suppressive effects of steinernema feltiae (strain sn) and s. riobrave (strain 7-12) applied as infective juveniles and in infected host insects, as well as application of s. feltiae's bacterial symbiont xenorhabdus bovienii on m. partityla. in two separate greenhouse trials, the treatments were applied to pecan seedlings that were simultaneously infested with m. partityla eggs; controls received only water and m. partityla eggs. additionally, all treatment applications were re-applied (without m. partityla eggs) two months later. four months after initial treatment, plants were assessed for number of galls per root system, number of egg masses per root system, number of eggs per root system, number of eggs per egg mass, number of eggs per gram dry root weight, dry shoot weight, and final population density of m. partityla second-stage juveniles (j2). in the first trial, the number of egg masses per plant was lower in the s. riobrave-infected host treatment than in the control (by approximately 18%). in the second trial, dry root weight was higher in the s. feltiae-infected host treatment than in the  control (approximately 80% increase). no other treatment effects were detected. the marginal and inconsistent effects observed in our experiments indicate that the treatments we applied are not sufficient for controlling m. partityla.

TI  == identification, typing, and insecticidal activity of xenorhabdus isolates from entomopathogenic nematodes in united kingdom soil and characterization of the xpt toxin loci.
AB  == xenorhabdus strains from entomopathogenic nematodes isolated from united kingdom  soils by using the insect bait entrapment method were characterized by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene, four housekeeping genes (asd, ompr, reca, and serc) and the flagellin gene (flic). most strains (191/197) were found to have genes with greatest similarity to those of xenorhabdus bovienii, and the remaining six strains had genes most similar to those of xenorhabdus nematophila. generally, 16s rrna sequences and the sequence types based on housekeeping genes  were in agreement, with a few notable exceptions. statistical analysis implied that recombination had occurred at the serc locus and that moderate amounts of interallele recombination had also taken place. surprisingly, the flic locus contained a highly variable central region, even though insects lack an adaptive  immune response, which is thought to drive flagellar variation in pathogens of higher organisms. all the x. nematophila strains exhibited a consistent pattern of insecticidal activity, and all contained the insecticidal toxin genes xpta1a2b1c1, which were present on a pathogenicity island (pai). the pais were similar among the x. nematophila strains, except for partial deletions of a peptide synthetase gene and the presence of insertion sequences. comparison of the pai locus with that of x. bovienii suggested that the pai integrated into the genome first and then acquired the xpt genes. the independent mobility of xpt genes was further supported by the presence of xpt genes in x. bovienii strain i73 on a type 2 transposon structure and by the variable patterns of insecticidal activity in x. bovienii isolates, even among closely related strains.

AB  == this work introduces and demonstrates the applicability of universally primed-pcr (up-pcr) for differentiating bacterial symbionts of entomopathogenic nematodes. furthermore, typing by up-pcr product cross-hybridisation was successfully introduced to cluster the bacterial strains. the work was initiated by isolating  10 isolates of photorhabdus temperata (s172) from the nematode host heterorhabditis sp. (dk172) and 12 isolates of xenorhabdus bovienii (s1) from the nematode steinernema feltiae (dk1). the isolates were compared by up-pcr using different primers. the two bacterial species (p. temperata and x. bovienii) could be distinguished on the basis of the banding pattern whereas isolates isolated from the same nematode host had identical banding patterns. three isolates obtained from dk172 and dk1, respectively, were then selected along with a number of reference strains (hb, hp88, c1, k122, hsh2, hl81, t228, 61, an6, q58) and further characterised by up-pcr product cross-hybridisation. the xenorhabdus strains (q58, an6, 61, t228, s1) represented three species and these species were separated by the hybridisation technique. the photorhabdus strains (hb, hp88, c1, k122, hsh2, hl81, s172) represented two species and were also separated according to this in the cross-hybridisation. within each species of photorhabdus, two subgroups were formed as a result of intensity of the hybridisation signals. this grouping was in agreement with previous studies in other laboratories.

AB  == in the first part of this study, generation times relative to temperature, together with cardinal and conceptual temperatures, were determined for four strains of xenorhabdus bacteria that represented three geographically distinct species. the data showed that the nf strain of xenorhabdus bovienii, like the umea strain of the same species, is psychrotrophic, while xenorhabdus sp. tx strain resembles xenorhabdus nematophila all strain in being mesophilic. in the second part, the capacity of these bacteria to adapt to changes in temperature, shown by changes in fatty acid composition, was investigated. as temperature declined, the proportions of the two major unsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic (16:1omega7) acid and oleic (18:1omega9) acid, increased significantly in all of  the strains. the proportion of the prevalent saturated fatty acid, which was palmitic acid (16:0), decreased. in the all, nf, and umea strains, myristic acid  (14:0), margaric acid (17:0), cyclopropane (17:0c), and arachidic acid (20:0) decreased with decreasing temperature. in the third part of the study, the synthesis of isozymes in response to changing temperature was investigated. for the seven enzymes studied, the numbers for which isozyme synthesis was temperature related were as follows: five for umea, four for all, three for nf, and two for tx. where the study dealt with fatty acid composition and isozyme synthesis, the results show a broad capacity for physiological temperature adaptation among strains of different climatic origin.

AB  == two species of entomopathogenic nematodes, heterorhabditis marelatus and steinernema oregonense, were described recently from the west coast of north america. it is not known whether the bacterial symbionts of these nematodes are also unique. here we compared partial 16s rrna sequences from the symbiotic bacteria of these two nematodes with sequence from previously described photorhabdus and xenorhabdus species. the 16s sequence from the new xenorhabdus isolate appears very similar to, although not identical to, that of x. bovienii,  the common symbiont of s. feltiae. the new photorhabdus isolate appears to be very distinct from other known photorhabdus species, although its closest affinities are with the p. temperata group. we also verified a monoxenic association between each isolate and its nematode by amplifying and sequencing bacterial 16s sequence from crushed adult and juvenile nematodes and from bacterial cultures isolated from infected hosts.

TI  == xenorhabdus bovienii t228 phase variation and virulence are independent of reca function.
AB  == colony pleomorphism, or phase variation, expressed by entomopathogenic bacteria belonging to the genus xenorhabdus, is an important factor which determines the association of the bacteria with their nematode symbiont and the outcome of infection of susceptible insect larvae by the bacterium- nematode parasitic complex. the mechanism underlying phase variation is unknown. to determine whether reca-mediated processes are linked to phase variation, the reca gene of xenorhabdus bovienii was cloned and sequenced. when expressed in a reca-deleted strain of escherichia coli, the x. bovienii reca clone was able to complement the loss of reca function. x. bovienii chromosomal reca insertion mutants showed increased sensitivity to uv. phase 1 forms did not show altered ability to convert to phase 2 and no significant differences in expression of other phase-dependent characteristics, including phospholipase c, haemolysin, protease, antibiotic activity and congo red binding, were noted. furthermore, the ld(50) of the x. bovienii reca insertion mutant for galleria mellonella larvae was not significantly different from that of wild-type strains. from these data the authors conclude that reca is unlikely to be involved in phase variation, the expression of phase-dependent characteristics, or virulence factors involved in killing of susceptible larvae.

AB  == xenorhabdus spp. and photorhabdus spp., entomopathogenic bacteria symbiotically associated with nematodes of the families steinernematidae and heterorhabditidae, respectively, were shown to produce different lipases when they were grown on suitable nutrient agar. substrate specificity studies showed that photorhabdus spp. exhibited a broad lipase activity, while most of the xenorhabdus spp. secreted a specific lecithinase. xenorhabdus spp. occur spontaneously in two variants, phase i and phase ii. only the phase i variants of xenorhabdus nematophilus and xenorhabdus bovienii strains produced lecithinase activity when  the bacteria were grown on a solid lecithin medium (0.01% lecithin nutrient agar; 24 h of growth). five enzymatic isomers responsible for this activity were separated from the supernatant of a x. nematophilus f1 culture in two chromatographic steps, cation-exchange chromatography and c18 reverse-phase chromatography. the substrate specificity of the x. nematophilus f1 lecithinase suggested that a phospholipase c preferentially active on phosphatidylcholine could be isolated. the entomotoxic properties of each isomer were tested by injection into the hemocoels of insect larvae. none of the isomers exhibited toxicity with the insects tested, locusta migratoria, galleria mellonella, spodoptera littoralis, and manduca sexta. the possible role of lecithinase as either a virulence factor or a symbiotic factor is discussed.

AB  == the encapsulation response of tipula oleracea to the entomopathogenic nematode steinernema feltiae was investigated by exposing the insects to nematode dauer juveniles (djs) and by injecting djs with and without the symbiotic bacteria xenorhabdus bovienii. the encapsulation response varied considerably between individual insect larvae. the variation could not be attributed to a more or less scattered nematode invasion over time since it was also recorded after simultaneous injection of a fixed dj dose. the proportion of encapsulated nematodes declined with increasing dose (injected djs/larva) from approx 80% for  1 dj/larva to 33-34% for 20 dj/larva. tipula oleracea larvae were capable of encapsulating nematodes with and without symbionts inside the hemocoel; however,  at doses of 10 and 20 dj/larva, axenic nematodes were encapsulated less frequently than monoxenic nematodes. injected axenic nematodes that were not encapsulated did not develop in t. oleracea larvae but disappeared from the insect's hemocoel. coinjection of symbiotic bacteria increased encapsulation of axenic nematodes, showing that x. bovienii is triggering the encapsulation response of t. oleracea against s. feltiae.

AB  == the pathogenicity of the nematode-bacterium complex steinernema feltiae-xenorhabdus bovienii to larvae of tipula oleracea and galleria mellonella was investigated by injection of dauer juvenile nematodes carrying their bacterial symbiont cells (monoxenic nematodes). axenic nematodes (free of bacteria) and the symbiotic bacteria themselves were tested. the lc50 of x. bovienii in t. oleracea was 15,700 colony forming units (cfu)/larva compared to < or = 8 cfu in g. mellonella. xenorhabdus bovienii is apparently removed from the  tipulids hemolymph, possibly by cellular defense mechanisms. axenic nematodes were less pathogenic than monoxenic nematodes for both insects. the difference was less pronounced in g. mellonella larvae: one axenic nematode was sufficient to kill 80% in 1 day. the remaining insects found dead after 50 days were developmentally arrested. in t. oleracea 20 axenic nematodes caused 39% whereas 20 monoxenic dauer juveniles caused 90% mortality within 8 days. the data indicate that the virulence of the s. feltiae/x. bovienii complex is greater than the additive effect of the nematodes and their bacteria, further evidence for the synergistic activity of the symbiotic bacto-helminthic complex during pathogenesis.

AB  == two types of antibiotics, namely, indoles and dithiolopyrrolones, have been isolated and identified from xenorhabdus bovienii a2. compounds 1 and 2 showed strong activity against cryptococcus neoformans, compounds 3 and 4 showed strong  activity against botrytis cinerea, and compounds 1, 3, and 4 showed significant activity against phytophthora infestants (2 was not tested). in addition, two lower homologues of xenorhabdins 5 and 6, namely, 6-(n-3'-methylbutanamido)-4,5-dihydro-1,2-dithiolo[4,3-b]pyr rol-5- one [7] and 6-(n-butanamido)[4,5-dihydro-1,2-dithiolo[4,3-b]pyrrol-5-one [8], have been isolated and characterized for the first time.

TI  == bacteriophage lambda as a delivery vector for tn10-derived transposons in xenorhabdus bovienii.
AB  == xenorhabdus bovienii wild-type strains lack a functional receptor protein (lamb)  in the outer membrane and as a result are unable to adsorb coliphage lambda (lambda). introduction of plasmids encoding lamb into x. bovienii t228 results in constitutive expression of lamb in the outer membrane of this organism. lamb-expressing strains of x. bovienii adsorb lambda bacteriophage particles and  can be used as hosts for lambda::tn constructs. a tn10-derived transposon, element 9 (j. c. way, d. davis, d. morisato, d. e. roberts, and n. kleckner, gene 32:369-379, 1984) was used to construct a variety of insertion mutants of x. bovienii. mutants that had altered expression of protease, lipase, dnase, dye-binding capability, and hemolytic activity, in addition to a series of auxotrophic mutants, were isolated.

TI  == plasmids and phase variation in xenorhabdus spp.
AB  == three strains of xenorhabdus nematophilus (a24, f1, nc116) and strain dan of xenorhabdus bovienii were tested to evaluate whether the phase variation observed in these bacteria was in any way connected with plasmids. the plasmid patterns of both phases of a24 and f1 strains were the same, whereas the two nc116 phases had only one band each. no difference was observed between the undigested or digested plasmid patterns of the two phases from the three strains. no plasmid was detected in either phase of strain dan. the plasmid probes were prepared from the six bands of a24 phase 1. by hybridization studies, three plasmids in two forms (open circular and supercoiled) were detected in the strain a24. two were estimated at 12 kb, and the smallest was about 4 kb. attempts to hybridize plasmid probes with either undigested or digested chromosomal dna of the two phases of strain a24 were unsuccessful. the results suggest that neither a difference in plasmid content nor a plasmid recombination with the chromosome is  involved in phase variation. the hybridizations revealed homologous dna sequences among the three plasmids of strain a24 and among the plasmids of strains such as  a24 and nc116, which were isolated from geographically distant countries, suggesting that plasmids may encode similar proteins.

TI  == a numerical taxonomic study of the genus xenorhabdus (enterobacteriaceae) and proposed elevation of the subspecies of x. nematophilus to species.
AB  == data from a study of both phases of 21 strains of xenorhabdus examined for 240 characters were subjected to numerical analysis. only 60 characters were used for the analyses, since 169 characters were common to all isolates, and the acidification data essentially duplicated the assimilation tests. the data were arranged in seven ways to determine the significance of characters affected by phase change and of weak responses. most of the analyses involved calculation of  similarities by the jaccard coefficient and clustering by single linkage, complete linkage and centroid sorting algorithms. the resultant dendrograms emphasized the importance of recognizing phase-related characteristics in examining the taxonomy of xenorhabdus. they also demonstrated a close correspondence between the taxonomic groupings of xenorhabdus and those of their  nematode associates. it is proposed that the subspecies of x. nematophilus be elevated to species, x. nematophilus, x. bovienii, x. poinarii and x. beddingii.

TI  == growth and virulence of steinernema glaseri influenced by different subspecies of xenorhabdus nematophilus.
AB  == three xenorhabdus nematophilus subspecies influenced steinernema glaseri growth profiles and growth rates, but this was not necessarily because of different bacterial growth rates. virulence of dauer nematodes in larval galleria mellonella varied with the number of dauers retaining bacteria and the bacterial  subspecies. virulence was least for dauers grown on x. nematophilus subsp. bovienii because of the lack of retained bacteria. virulence was subsequently restored by culturing these nematodes on x. nematophilus subsp. poinari.
