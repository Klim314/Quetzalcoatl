TI  == probiotic bifico cocktail ameliorates helicobacter pylori induced gastritis.
AB  == aim: to determine the protective effect of triple viable probiotics on gastritis  induced by helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and elucidate the possible mechanisms  of protection. methods: colonization of bifico strains in the mouse stomach was determined by counting colony-forming units per gram of stomach tissue. after treatment with or without bifico, inflammation and h. pylori colonization in the  mouse stomach were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin and giemsa staining, respectively. cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and milliplex. the activation of nuclear factor (nf)-kappab and mapk signaling in human gastric epithelial cells was evaluated by western blot analysis. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify tlr2, tlr4 and myd88 mrna expression in the mouse stomach. results: we demonstrated that bifico, which contains a mixture of enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus, was tolerant to the mouse stomach environment and was able to survive both the 8-h and 3-d courses of administration. although bifico treatment had no effect on the colonization of h. pylori in the mouse stomach, it ameliorated h. pylori-induced gastritis by significantly inhibiting the expression of cytokines and chemokines such as tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-10, il-6, g-csf and mip-2 (p < 0.05). these results led us to hypothesize that bifico treatment would diminish the h. pylori-induced inflammatory response in gastric mucosal epithelial cells in vitro via the nf-kappab and mapk signaling pathways. indeed, we observed a decrease in the expression of the nf-kappab subunit p65 and in the phosphorylation of ikappab-alpha, erk and p38. moreover, there was a significant decrease in the production of il-8, tnf-alpha, g-csf and gm-csf (p < 0.05), and the increased expression of tlr2, tlr4 and myd88 induced by h. pylori in the stomach was also significantly reduced following bifico treatment (p < 0.05). conclusion: our results suggest that the probiotic cocktail bifico can ameliorate h. pylori-induced gastritis by inhibiting the inflammatory response in gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of b. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens e. coli and s. aureus.
AB  == the impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. the gut microbiota has been known to play a  crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a  potential new territory for drug targeting. herein, graphene oxide (go) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, b. adolescentis, l. acidophilus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus, was studied. it was shown that, in bacterial media, go sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of b. adolescentis against the pathogens e. coli ands. aureus. data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16s rrna gene sequencing consistently indicated that go sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for b. adolescentis. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and  that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with go sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of go. these results suggest the possibility of using go sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == hydrolysates of glycated and heat-treated peanut 7s globulin (ara h 1) modulate human gut microbial proliferation, survival and adhesion.
AB  == aims: evaluation of an effect of glycation of ara h 1 on proliferation and survival rate and adhesion of intestinal enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli  and lactobacillus acidophilus. methods and results: pure ara h 1 heated at three  different temperature conditions (g37, g60 and c145 degrees c) in the presence or absence of glucose was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. impacts of ara h 1 hydrolysates on the bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion to caco-2 cells in mono and heterogeneous cultures were studied with fluorescent techniques: dapi, live/dead staining and fish. examined hydrolysates hindered proliferation of e. coli and ent. faecalis with simultaneous decrease in their survival. maillard reaction (mr, glycation) of ara h 1 did not alter the effect of hydrolysates on bacterial proliferation rate. hydrolysates modified at 60 and  145 degrees c with glucose altered the profile of immobilized bacteria, mostly by lowering the number of adhering e. coli and promoting the adhesion of bacteria from genera lactobacillus and enterococcus. conclusions: ara h1 hydrolysates processed in various ways demonstrated their strong modulatory effect on bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion. significance and impact of the study: reducing the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria by hydrolysates of ara h 1 glycated at 60 and 145 degrees c, together with modulation of immobilization  of beneficial lactobacilli and enterococci, may be of relevance in terms of the physiological status of the intestinal barrier.

TI  == comparing the efficacy of hyper-pure chlorine-dioxide with other oral antiseptics on oral pathogen microorganisms and biofilm in vitro.
AB  == this study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (naocl),  chlorhexidine gluconate (chx), listerine(r), and high purity chlorine dioxide (solumium, clo2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro. antimicrobial activity of oral antiseptics was compared to the  gold standard phenol. we investigated streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, veillonella alcalescens, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and candida albicans as some important representatives of the oral pathogens. furthermore, we collected dental plaque from the upper first molars of healthy young students. massive biofilm was formed in vitro and its reduction was measured after treating it with mouthrinses: chx,  listerine(r) or hyper pure clo2. their biofilm disrupting effect was measured after dissolving the crystal violet stain from biofilm by photometer. the results have showed that hyper pure clo2 solution is more effective than other currently  used disinfectants in case of aerobic bacteria and candida yeast. in case of anaerobes its efficiency is similar to chx solution. the biofilm dissolving effect of hyper pure clo2 is significantly stronger compared to chx and listerine(r) after 5 min treatment. in conclusion, hyper pure clo2 has a potent disinfectant efficacy on oral pathogenic microorganisms and a powerful biofilm dissolving effect compared to the current antiseptics, therefore high purity clo2 may be a new promising preventive and therapeutic adjuvant in home oral care and  in dental or oral surgery practice.

TI  == [system analysis of the relationship between the metabolism of vitamins by micro-biota and the survival of the positive microflora of the digestive tract].
AB  == a perspective direction of the treatment of dysbacteriosis is the use of so-called metabolic prebiotics--products of metabolism of positive flora (for example, water substrate of the products of metabolism of e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, l. helveticus (strains of dsm), out of which, as known, drug hylak forte is made. our earlier systematic analysis of metabolomics, representatives of positive microflora, pointed to the fact that the latter contain specific biochemical mechanisms for biosynthesis and processing of a number of vitamins. in the present paper the results of a systematic analysis of  the effects of vitamins b2, b6 and k on the survival of the representatives of the positive microflora on the basis of the substrate of metabolic products of positive flora have been presented. the results of the analysis allow us clarify  the molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this drug with a very complex structure and confirm the available clinical data and are an important foundation for subsequent microbiological research. metabolites in the preparation composition contribute to the normalization of metabolism of pyridoxalphosphate (vitamin b6), flavin adenin dinucleotide (fad, a derivative of vitamin b2) and nicotinamide dinucleotide (nad, a derivative of vitamin b3)--cofactors of enzymes that have a significant impact on the survival of microbiota. the proposed molecular mechanisms also indicate on a possible synergies between certain vitamins and micro elements, on the one hand, and molecular components of the preparations on the basis of waste products of microbiota on the other.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus strains used in clinical practice as probiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of probiotic strains that are suggested to be effective for preventing antibiotics-associated diarrhea (aad). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 17 antibiotics against probiotic strains were tested by the agar plate  dilution method or broth microdilution method. in all, eight probiotic strains containing enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium spp., clostridium butyricum, and lactobacillus acidophilus were tested. although the mic range was wide, from  less than 0.0625 to more than 1,024 mug/ml, the mics of 11 beta-lactams were high for three of four enterococci, with a range of 32 to more than 1,024 mug/ml. in contrast, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin showed potent activities against all enterococci, of which mics were 0.25-8 mug/ml. two bifidobacterium strains and one lactobacillus strain showed low mics against many of the beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and vancomycin, with mics of 8 mug/ml or less. fosfomycin showed generally mild activity against enterococci (mic, 8-32 mug/ml)  and anaerobic strains (mic, 32 to >1,024 mug/ml), respectively. the probiotics strains with high mic values may survive in the intestinal tract, even if the patient was concomitantly using the antibiotics in clinical practice. therefore,  our results suggest that adequate combinations of probiotics strains and antibiotics should be important for preventing aad. further study is needed to determine the efficacy of probiotics in clinical practice.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  == carbon nanotubes (cnts) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. previous observations have shown that cnts have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of cnts to human gut microbes has not been investigated. here, the antibacterial activity of cnts against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--l. acidophilus, b. adolescentis, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus--are evaluated. the bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. in this study, cnts, including single-walled cnts (swcnts, 1-3 mum), short and long  multi-walled cnts (s-mwcnts: 0.5-2 mum; l-mwcnts: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled cnts (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. notably, cnts may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of cnts, but also the shapes of the bacteria. the mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components dna and rna and allowing  a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. thin and rigid swcnt show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than mwcnts. long mwcnt may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. this work suggests that cnts may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of cnts could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic  bacteria.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
AB  == purpose: multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. we therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: we used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to  inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both ph-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. results: in the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, l. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against e. faecalis, l. fermentum the most inhibitory against e. coli. a commercially available mixture of 14 strains (bio-kult((r))) was the most effective mixture, against e. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against e. coli. mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. in the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when ph was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral ph. conclusions: both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. the propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. the addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first  experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). with rtq pcr detected species from the genus enterococcus were: e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus and from genus lactobacillus were: lactobacillus crispatus, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius. with maldi tof ms biotyper from enterobacteriaceae genera were identified citrobacter braakii, raoultella ornithinolytica, serratia fonticola, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca. antimicrobial activities in vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. the best antimicrobial  effect of citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.

TI  == caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus strain ncfm enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  == although the immune response of caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved c. elegans host responses. we found that the probiotic gram-positive bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is not harmful to c. elegans and that l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to colonize the c. elegans intestine. conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic  strains of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates. preexposure of nematodes to bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. importantly, l. acidophilus ncfm activates key immune signaling pathways involved in c. elegans defenses against gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via tir-1 and pmk-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via bar-1). interestingly, conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm had a minimal effect on gram-negative infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with gram-negative pathogens or general stress. in conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm modulates specific c. elegans immunity traits.

TI  == fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration. thirty postweaned pigs (25 day old) were distributed into 2 groups: control (n = 15) and probiotic (n = 15). each experimental group was fed ad libitum on a commercial diet for 35 days. lactobacillus amylovorus and enterococcus faecium mixed culture (10(8) cfu/ml)was daily orally delivered to the probiotic group. at the end of the assay, six pigs randomly selected from each group were slaughtered and muscle samples (longissimus dorsi) were taken for fatty acid analysis. tissues from the probiotic group animals exhibited an increase in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; furthermore, linoleic acid (c18:2), linolenic acid (18:3), and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla) concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared  to the control group. these results suggest probiotic administration could be useful to modify and improve the fatty acid profile of pig meat.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

AB  == objectives: the most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vana transposon tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in  enterococcus faecium. the limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. we investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vana-containing plasmids hosted by e. faecium (n = 9), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. methods: a filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. donor strains were mated with three e. faecium recipients,  three e. faecalis recipients, a lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a lactococcus lactis recipient and two bifidobacterium recipients. transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. results: in total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. in  summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. all recipients of the same species behaved similarly. inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pip501/pambeta1) only. acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in  the new host. conclusions: intra-species transfer of enterococcal vana plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vana-containing plasmids among e. faecium. a  reservoir of vana plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == probiotics in the arabian gulf region.
AB  == objective: available reports on adherence to recommended guidelines for labeling  of probiotic products are based on assessment of these products in developed countries. in the arabian gulf region, there is a paucity of data on the characterization of probiotic products and an absence of local guidelines for their labeling. this study, carried out in the united arab emirates (uae), represents the first evaluation of probiotic products available in the arabian peninsula. methods: probiotic products were purchased over the counter from a variety of sources, including pharmacies, healthfood stores, and supermarkets across the uae. all identified products were listed and information regarding type of product preparation and labeling information were recorded. results: a total of 37 probiotic products, 15 dairy-based and 22 non-dairy-based were identified. the dairy products comprised of 12 yogurts, two fermented milk products and one powdered baby formula. the majority of non-dairy products were in capsule form (n = 16). while all the non-dairy products gave information about the strain of probiotic microorganism and number present at time of manufacture,  this information was provided for only one dairy-based product. strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were the most common probiotic organisms identified. however, one probiotic product listed enterococcus faecalis (750 million viable bacteria per capsule) as a component. with the exception of one non-dairy-based product, all health-related claims were structure/function statements, according  to the us food and drug administration nomenclature. conclusion: these findings indicate that a wide variety of probiotic products are available in the arabian gulf. development of guidelines for labeling of these probiotic products and use  of structure/function statements and health claims should be addressed.

TI  == compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d-alanine, l-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15n and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == a total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china. in order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in ph 3.5 mrs medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. the result of identification by api, sequence analysis of 16s rrna and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis showed that there were three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of lactobacillus casein, three strains of lactobacillus  brevis, two strains of enterococcus faecium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis, four strains of bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of  bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. these strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. the results presented here show that l. rhamnosus lv108, l.  rhamnosus f, b. brevise r39 and b. infantis r42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.

TI  == detection of blastocystis from stool samples using real-time pcr.
AB  == we developed a real-time lc pcr assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the blastocystis genome. the described assay detected 11 of 11 atcc strains of blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. three of three stool samples from oregon and california military personnel that were negative for blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional pcr assay  were positive for blastocystis using our real-time lc pcr assay. diagnosis of blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including dna extraction and real-time pcr, only requires 3 h. the lower limit of detection for blastocystis in stool using the real-time lc pcr assay was calculated to be 760 cells of blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. the assay did not cross-react with ruminococcus hansenii, anarococcus hydrogenalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium prausnitzii, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in blastocystis infections in the usa we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of blastocystis infection.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus acidophilus dsm13241 as a probiotic in healthy adult cats.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with the probiotic strain lactobacillus acidophilus dsm13241 in healthy adult cats. animals: 15 adult cats. procedures: cats were fed a nutritionally complete dry food for 5 weeks. fecal character was assessed daily, and a single fecal sample and 3-ml blood sample were collected for bacterial enumeration and hematologic analysis, respectively. cats were then fed the same diet supplemented with l acidophilus dsm13241 (2 x 10(8) cfu/d) for 4.5 weeks. repeat fecal and hematologic measurements were taken prior to the return to control diet for a 4-week period.  results: the probiotic species was recovered from feces, demonstrating survival through the feline gastrointestinal tract. probiotic supplementation was associated with increased numbers of beneficial lactobacillus and l acidophilus groups in feces and decreased numbers of clostridium spp and enterococcus faecalis, indicating an altered bacterial balance in the gastrointestinal tract microflora. fecal ph was also decreased suggesting a colonic environment selective for the beneficial lactic acid bacterial population. systemic and immunomodulatory effects were associated with administration of l acidophilus dsm13241 including altered cell numbers within wbc subsets and enhanced phagocytic capacity in the peripheral granulocyte population. in addition, plasma endotoxin concentrations were decreased during probiotic feeding, and rbcs had a  decreased susceptibility to osmotic pressure. conclusions and clinical relevance: probiotic strain l acidophilus dsm13241 fed at 2 x 10(8) cfu/d can alter the balance of gastrointestinal microflora in healthy cats. furthermore, administration of this probiotic results in beneficial systemic and immunomodulatory effects in cats.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == modulation of antibody-mediated immune response by probiotics in chickens.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum, have been shown to enhance antibody responses in mammals. the objective  of this study was to examine the effects of a probiotic product containing the above bacteria in addition to streptococcus faecalis on the induction of the chicken antibody response to various antigens, both systemically and in the gut.  the birds received probiotics via oral gavage and subsequently were immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc) and bovine serum albumin (bsa) to evaluate antibody responses in serum or with tetanus toxoid (tt) to measure the mucosal antibody response in gut contents. control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. overall, bsa and srbc induced a detectable antibody response as early as  week 1 postimmunization (p.i.), which lasted until week 3 p.i. probiotic-treated  birds had significantly (p <or= 0.001) more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin m [igm]) to srbc than the birds that were not treated with probiotics. however, treatment with probiotics did not enhance the serum igm and  igg antibody responses to bsa. immunization with tt resulted in the presence of specific iga and igg antibody responses in the gut. again, treatment with probiotics did not change the level or duration of the antibody response in the gut. in conclusion, probiotics enhance the systemic antibody response to some antigens in chickens, but it remains to be seen whether probiotics have an effect on the generation of the mucosal antibody response.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and tightness of a dcpd-cao-based hydraulic calcium phosphate cement for root canal filling.
AB  == calcium hydroxide is currently used in dentistry for endodontic treatments where  its main advantage is its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. however,  it also has some drawbacks such as pulp necrosis, slight solubility, slow and insufficient hardening, and retraction on drying. in consequence, it is used only as temporary material for root canal disinfection. by mixing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (cahpo4 . 2h2o, also called dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, dcpd) and calcium oxide with a sodium phosphate buffer as liquid phase, we obtained a cpc with better mechanical properties than calcium hydroxide pastes. the setting reaction produced either hydroxyapatite (ha) or a mixture of ha and calcium hydroxide depending on the relative masses of dcpd and cao in the cement  powder. the presence of calcium hydroxide a priori confers antimicrobial properties to this cement which were investigated in agar plates (diffusion method) against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus hominis (clinical isolates), and  a preparation of polymicrobial flora isolated from dental plaque. the cement samples tested were prepared at molar calcium-to-phosphate ratios (ca/p) of 1.67  to 2.75. a pure calcium hydroxide paste was used as reference material. clear and reproducible bacterial growth inhibition was observed for cement samples with ca/p > or = 2 against all the microorganisms tested. with ca/p = 2.5, this cement alkalinizes dentinal tubules and provides a fluid-tight sealing that well compares with sealing obtained using a zinc oxide-eugenol cement without gutta-percha point. dcpd-cao-based cement is therefore a potential root canal filler.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == role of internalization in the pathogenicity of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.
AB  == we investigated the role of bacterial internalization in the killing caused by shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) infection using a gnotobiotic murine model. a high number of internalized stec was found in the colonic epithelial cells of stec-infected mice by both an ex vivo assay and transmission  electron microscopy. most of these mice were killed within 10 days after infection. however, the implantation of lactic acid bacteria in such mice before  infection markedly decreased the number of internalized stecs and also completely protected these hosts from killing by a stec infection. the inhibition of such internalization by immunoglobulin also prevented the hosts from being killed. the shiga toxin levels in these hosts indicated an inhibition of the penetration of shiga toxins produced in the colon to the underlying tissue. these results suggested that the internalization plays an important role in the pathogenicity caused by stec infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.

AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

AB  == background: recent epidemiological studies indicate that antibiotic use in infancy may be associated with an increased risk of developing atopy. our previous work on animals demonstrated that kanamycin use during infancy promotes  a shift in the th1/th2 balance towards a th2-dominant immunity. objective: the first purpose of this study is to clarify whether or not the supplementation of intestinal bacteria can reverse such a th2-skewed response induced by neonatal antibiotic use. the second objective is to elucidate the contribution of genetic  factors to antibiotic-induced immune-deviation. methods: balb/c or c57bl/6 mice at 3 weeks of age were orally administered 600 microg/day of kanamycin sulphate for seven consecutive days. thereafter, the mice were inoculated with one type of intestinal bacterial species: enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus or bacteroides vulgatus. blood samples were collected 10 weeks after the cessation of kanamycin treatment, and the effect of the kanamycin treatment on th1/th2 balance was evaluated based on in vivo antibody levels. results: a kanamycin-induced elevation of the serum ige levels was reversed by the supplementation with enterococcus faecalis, and to a lesser extent by that with lactobacillus acidophilus. the ige/igg2a ratio in the mice supplemented with enterococcus faecalis significantly decreased in comparison with that in the kanamycin-treated mice without any bacterial supplementation, while such a ratio  was enhanced in the mice inoculated with bacteroides vulgatus. no antibiotic-induced th2-skewed response was seen in c57bl/6 mice that are genetically biased towards th1-dominant immunity. conclusion: these results suggest that adequate probiotic intervention after antibiotic treatment may improve the intestinal ecosystem, and thereby prevent the th2-shifted immunity induced by neonatal antibiotic use. in addition, the difference of genetic backgrounds also contributes to such an antibiotic-induced th2-skewed response.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  == germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (il-10 ko) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) after they were colonized with a pure culture of enterococcus faecalis. e. faecalis not only induced ibd (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the il-10 ko mice. conventional (complex-intestinal flora) il-10 ko mice developed ibd within 10 to  15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with e. faecalis-induced ibd in gnotobiotic il-10 ko mice. conversely, neither germ-free il-10 mice nor il-10 ko mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of candida albicans, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, l. reuteri, l. acidophilus, a bifidobacterium sp., lactococcus lactis, or a bacillus sp. developed ibd during the 25- to 30-week study. e. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger ibd, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

AB  == the cryptic plasmid psbo1 (3904 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. psbo1 contained an open reading frame (orf) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (rep) in pefc1 (isolated from enterococcus faecalis), psk639 (staphylococcus epidermidis), pla103 (lactobacillus acidophilus), and pucl287 (tetragenococcus halophila). in addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (drs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of psbo1. recombinant plasmids (psbe10 and psbe11) containing the drs and putative rep of psbo1 replicated in s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8 strains. this result  indicates that the putative rep encoded rep and that the replicon of psbo1 contained the drs and the rep. gel shift assays showed that the rep of psbo1 bound the 22-bp drs.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the small (5149 bp) and cryptic plasmid ps86  from enterococcus faecalis ssp. faecalis s-86 has been determined. sequence analysis revealed six putative open reading frames (orfs) encoding polypeptides of 28.3, 11.5, 8.4, 65.1, 7.3, and 11.96 kda each. based on sequence similarity,  two cassettes have been identified in ps86: orf1 codes for the replication initiation protein (rep); orf4 codes for a putative mobilization protein that shows similarities to mob/pre proteins from plasmids of gram-positive bacteria. no function could be assigned to the other putative orfs found. according to our  results, ps86 plasmid could use a theta-mode of replication, similar to the recently described theta-type replicons from pucl287 (tetragenococcus halophila)  and pla1 or pla105 (lactobacillus acidophilus) plasmids.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == effects of a mixture of organisms, lactobacillus acidophilus or streptococcus faecalis on delta6-desaturase activity in the livers of rats fed a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet.

AB  == the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis to solid substrata by an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == objectives: the potency of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant "surlactin" to reduce the initial adhesion of enterococcus faecalis 1131 was investigated on a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic substratum in a parallel-plate flow chamber, using phosphate-buffered saline and pooled human urine as a suspending fluid. methods: a parallel-plate flow chamber with a glass or silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with different biosurfactant solutions of 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/ml for overnight adsorption (18 hours). subsequently, the adhesion of e. faecalis on thus prepared biosurfactant layers was observed in situ in phosphate-buffered saline or in urine by automated image analysis. results: adsorbed biosurfactant layers caused an important, dose-related inhibition of the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis and the number of adherent bacteria after  4 hours on both hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic silicone rubber, although this  effect was stronger in buffer than in urine. for the experiments carried out in urine, the inhibitory effect of the biosurfactant layer was largest when silicone rubber was used rather than glass, whereas no influence of the substratum hydrophobicity on the inhibition of e. faecalis adhesion was noticed for experiments performed in buffer. conclusions: the biosurfactant surlactin, as released by several lactobacillus isolates, might open the way to the development of antiadhesive biologic coatings for catheter materials. it should be considered, however, that these results are preliminary and that the efficiency of the biosurfactant is probably affected not only by the hydrophobicity of the substratum and the suspending fluid, but also by the type of uropathogen involved.

AB  == the plasma levels of phenol, p-cresol, and indican are markedly increased in uremic patients, and cannot be efficiently reduced by hemodialysis. such uremic toxins, which are produced in the intestine as bacterial putrefactive metabolites, accumulate to a great degree in the feces of hemodialysis patients.  oral administration of lebenin, a preparation consisting of antibiotic-resistant  lactic acid bacteria, reduced the levels of fecal putrefactive metabolites to levels comparable with those of healthy subjects. moreover, the plasma level of indican also significantly decreased in these lebenin-treated patients. an analysis of the fecal microflora revealed that a disturbed composition of the microflora characterized by an overgrowth of aerobic bacteria is restored to normal by oral administration of lebenin in hemodialysis patients. these results  thus demonstrate that oral administration of lactic acid bacteria in uremic patients is effective in reducing the levels of uremic toxins, especially that of indican, in the blood by inhibiting bacterial production by means of correcting the intestinal microflora.

AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

AB  == approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms  and pathogens. only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied  in more detail. lactobacillus salivarius m7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin b which inhibits the growth of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. a new atypical bacteriocin produced by lact. acidophilus m46, acidocin b, combines the inhibition of clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow  activity spectrum within the genus lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. acidocin b is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees c for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. native acidocin b occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kda), while with sds-page the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kda. optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin b produced during growth. growth is not necessary for acidocin b production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a  chemically defined production medium. the application potential of acidocin b is  discussed.

TI  == purification and partial characterization of lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus 11088.
AB  == lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus 11088 (nck88), was purified and characterized. lactacin f is heat stable, proteinaceous, and inhibitory to other lactobacilli as well as enterococcus faecalis. the bacteriocin was isolated as a floating pellet from culture supernatants brought to 35 to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate. native lactacin f was sized at approximately 180 kda by gel filtration. column fractions having lactacin f activity were examined by electron microscopy and contained micelle-like globular particles. purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and high-performance liquid chromatography resulted in a 474-fold increase in specific activity of lactacin f. the purified bacteriocin was identified as a 2.5-kda peptide by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the lactacin f peptide retained activity after extraction from sds-page gel slices, confirming the identity of the 2.5-kda peptide. variants of  nck88 that failed to exhibit lactacin f activity did not produce the 2.5-kda band. sequence analysis of purified lactacin f identified 25 n-terminal amino acids containing an arginine residue at the n terminus. composition analysis indicates that lactacin f may contain as many as 56 amino acid residues.

TI  == influence of bacteria on clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
AB  == when monoflora chickens with lactobacillus acidophilus or streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of  c. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. c. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/g after inoculation 10(8) cfu broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. when c. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, c. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. these findings indicate that the pathogenicity of c. perfringens was suppressed by l. acidophilus or s. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == effect of infection with eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  == monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. there were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and e. tenella. seven days after e. tenella infection, counts of b. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for e. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by b. thermophilum alone, whereas  10 days after e. tenella infection, counts were higher for e. tennella-infected birds. the population of l. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the e. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. no significant differences were observed between the numbers of b. vulgatus, c. perfringens, and s. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without e. tenella infections.

TI  == dietary fibre, bacterial metabolism and toxicity of nitrate in the rat.
AB  == 1. a semi-synthetic diet, the semi-synthetic diet plus pectin, and a stock diet were fed to rats, and three metabolic functions of the caecal bacteria (reduction of amaranth, p-nitrobenzoic acid and nitrate) were measured in vitro. 2. no consistent differences were noted between diets for the reduction of amaranth and p-nitrobenzoic acid. 3. no consistent differences in nitrate reductase activity were noted for rats maintained on a stock diet or a fibre-free diet. however, the addition of 5% pectin to the latter diet resulted in a several-fold increase in nitrite production. 4. this increased nitrite production in vitro was associated  with methaemoglobinaemia following the oral administration of nitrate to rats fed the diet containing pectin. animals receiving the basal fibre-free diet were unaffected by nitrate.

TI  == proteolytic activity of streptococcus mutans (gs-5).
AB  == the potential proteolytic ability of cariogenic streptococci was assessed in a strain of streptococcus mutans (gs-5). blood-borne s. mutans from rats infected by mouth with gs-5 were cultured, and sterile rat tail tendons were placed on these cultured bacterial colonies. the collagenolytic ability of these organisms  was examined under the scanning electron microscope and by testing for reduced tensile strength of the collagen fibers. these experiments showed that gs-5 cariogenic streptococcus can be conditioned to produce significant collagenolytic activity.

TI  == effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  == six species of microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of cd per ml. at 40 and 80 mug of cd per ml, e. coli and b. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed.  cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. the significance of these data with respect to cd in food chains is discussed.

AB  == cellulose-acetate and agar gel immunoelectrophoresis were used to study the serum protein patterns of germfree rats before and after monoassociation with a pure culture of staphylococcus aureus (phage type 80/81), streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or proteus vulgaris. all six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. only s. aureus and p. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. l. acidophilus, s. faecalis, and b. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the  serum proteins. p. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.

TI  == nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
AB  == we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase  activity. nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.

TI  == effects of lactic acid-forming bacteria on vibrio comma inoculated into intestinal segments of rabbits.
AB  == hattori, h. (sankyo co., ltd., tokyo, japan), h. misawa, i. igarashi, and y. sugiya. effects of lactic acid-forming bacteria on vibrio comma inoculated into intestinal segments of rabbits. j. bacteriol. 90:541-545. 1965.-mixed inocula of  vibrio comma kc-4 and various lactic acid-forming bacteria were injected into the intestinal segments of rabbits (de and chatterje, 1953) to observe the effects of the latter agents in altering the changes produced by strain kc-4. the animals were sacrificed 10 and 20 hr after inoculation. the inoculated intestinal segments were first examined grossly, and the amount of exudate in the segments,  if any, was measured, after which the tissues were subjected to pathological examination. when kc-4 cells together with spore-bearing lactic acid-forming bacilli, strain p-22, or lactobacillus casei were introduced, the intestinal segments showed few or no macroscopic and microscopic changes, and no accumulation of exudate. with mixed inoculation with lactic acid bacteria such as l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus lactis, and s. faecalis, changes were produced by strain kc-4. macroscopically, no difference was discernible between the changes caused by mixed inoculation and those produced by single inoculation of kc-4. upon pathological examination, however, it was seen that changes resulting from mixed inoculation were slightly less severe than those produced by inoculation with strain kc-4 only.
