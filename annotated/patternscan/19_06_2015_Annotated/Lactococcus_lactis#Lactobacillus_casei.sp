TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == nisin-induced expression of a recombinant antihypertensive peptide in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == objective: to improve the process for the production of milk-derived antihypertensive peptides, including a 12-residue peptide (ffvapfpecvgk) from alphas1-casein. results: a synthetic gene encoding this peptide was cloned within the pediocin operon, replacing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature pediocin peptide (papa) and resulting in a translational fusion between the pediocin leader peptide and the 12-residue hypotensive (c-12) peptide. the recombinant operon was subsequently cloned immediately downstream of the nisa promoter to allow for inducible gene expression within streptococcus thermophilus st128, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lactobacillus casei c2. rt-pcr was used to confirm recombinant gene expression in complex medium; and sds-page analysis showed that the pediocin secretion machinery, encoded by papc and papd,  allowed for secretion of the recombinant peptide from both l. lactis ml3 and l. casei c2 in a chemically defined medium. conclusion: the use of a nisin as a "food-grade" inducer molecule, and generally-regarded-as-safe lab species suggests that this system could be used for the production of functional food ingredients.

TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity of tropical grass-legumes silages.
AB  == calliandra calothyrsus preserved in silage is an alternative method for improving the crude protein content of feeds for sustainable ruminant production. the aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of silage which contained different  levels of c. calothyrsus by examining the fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. silage was made in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments with three replications i.e.: r0, pennisetum purpureum 100%; r1, p. purpureum 75%+c. calothyrsus 25%;, r2, p. purpureum 50%+c. calothyrsus 50%; r3, p. purpureum 25%+c. calothyrsus 75%; and r4, c. calothyrsus 100%. all silages were prepared using plastic jar silos (600 g) and incubated at room temperature for 30 days. silages were analyzed for fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. increased levels of c. calothyrsus in silage had a significant effect (p<0.01) on the fermentation characteristics. the microbial diversity index decreased and activity was inhibited with increasing levels of c. calothyrsus. the microbial community indicated that there was a population of lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. brevis, lactococcus lactis, chryseobacterium sp., and uncultured bacteria. the result confirmed that silage with a combination of grass and c. calothyrsus had good fermentation characteristics and microbial communities were dominated by l. plantarum.

TI  == selenite-stress selected mutant strains of probiotic bacteria for se source production.
AB  == selenium deficiency is a major health problem worldwide for about 1 billion people. bacterial cells usually possess low tolerance to selenite stress and also low ability to reduce high concentrations of toxic selenite. here, high tolerance to selenite and selenium bioaccumulation capability were developed in mutated clones of probiotic and starter bacteria including enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis  ssp. lactis by food-level strain development process and clone selection. all mutant clones possessed increased glutathione concentration and glutathione reductase activity. the selenite treatment increased further these values in l. casei mutant strain pointing at a different selenite reduction pathway and/or stress response in this organism. considerable conversion of selenite to cell bound selenium forms with a concomitant high biomass production was detected in e. faecium and b. animalis ssp. lactis cultures. possible application of these strains as food and feed supplements is under investigation.

TI  == unpasteurised commercial boza as a source of microbial diversity.
AB  == boza is a cereal-based fermented beverage widely consumed in many countries of the balkans. the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiota of three bulgarian boza samples through a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods with the long-term objective of formulating a multi-strain starter culture specifically destined for the manufacture of new cereal-based drinks. the isolation campaign for lactic acid bacteria (lab) allowed the identification of lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus buchneri, pediococcus parvulus and members of the lactobacillus casei group. concerning yeasts, the following isolates were identified: pichia fermentans, pichia norvegensis, pichia guilliermondii (synonym meyerozyma guilliermondii) and torulaspora spp. a high intra-species diversity was revealed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. in parallel, microbial dna was directly extracted from the three boza samples, and portions of the rrn operons were analysed through polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). the molecular fingerprinting partially confirmed the results of culturing. among lab, the species weissella confusa, weissella oryzae, leuconostoc citreum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus parvulus and pediococcus ethanolidurans were detected together with members of the lb. casei group. among the yeasts, the species p. fermentans, m. guilliermondii, galactomyces geotrichum and geotrichum fragrans were found. the overall results confirmed boza as having a rich and heterogeneous biodiversity both in terms of species and genetically diverse strains, thus encouraging its exploitation for the isolation and future technological characterisation of cultures to be selected for the manufacture of innovative cereal-based drinks.

TI  == isolation of enterococcus faecium nm113, enterococcus faecium nm213 and lactobacillus casei nm512 as novel probiotics with immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == probiotics, defined as living bacteria that are beneficial for human health, mainly function through their immunomodulatory abilities. hence, these microorganisms have proven successful for treating diseases resulting from immune deregulation. the aim of this study was to find novel candidates to improve on and complement current probiotic treatment strategies. of 60 lactic acid bacterial strains that were isolated from fecal samples of healthy, full-term, breast-fed infants, three were chosen because of their ability to activate human  immune cells. these candidates were then tested with regard to immunomodulatory properties, antimicrobial effects on pathogens, required pharmacological properties and their safety profiles. to identify the immunomodulatory structures of the selected isolates, activation of specific innate immune receptors was studied. the three candidates for probiotic treatment were assigned enterococcus  faecium nm113, enterococcus faecium nm213 and lactobacillus casei nm512. compared with the established allergy-protective strain lactococcus lactis g121, these isolates induced release of similar amounts of il-12, a potent inducer of t helper 1 cells. in addition, all three neonatal isolates had antimicrobial activity against pathogens. analysis of pharmacological suitability showed high tolerance of low ph, bile salts and pancreatic enzymes. in terms of safe application in humans, the isolates were sensitive to three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin). in addition, the enterococcus isolates were free from the four major virulence genes (cyla, agg, efaafs and ccf). moreover, the isolates strongly activated toll-like receptor 2, which suggests lipopeptides as their active immunomodulatory structure. thus, three novel bacterial strains with great potential as probiotic candidates and promising immunomodulatory properties have here been identified and characterized.

TI  == effect of kcl substitution on bacterial viability of escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  == excessive intake of nacl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of nacl with other salts, such as kcl. in this study, the effects of nacl reduction and its substitution with kcl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (escherichia coli) were investigated using fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. a critical nacl concentration that inhibited the viability of e. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. to find the critical nacl concentration, de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) broth was supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and ftir spectra was monitored for all bacteria. a nacl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of nacl to inhibit e. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. the ftir spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the nacl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of  the bacteria. escherichia coli and b. longum were more sensitive to substitution  of nacl with kcl, compared with lb. acidophilus, lb. casei, and lc. lactis ssp. lactis. to evaluate the effect of substitution of nacl with kcl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% kcl). the findings suggest that 50% substitution of nacl with kcl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit e. coli without  affecting the probiotic bacteria.

TI  == coexpression and secretion of endoglucanase and phytase genes in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == a multifunctional transgenic lactobacillus with probiotic characteristics and an  ability to degrade beta-glucan and phytic acid (phytate) was engineered to improve nutrient utilization, increase production performance and decrease digestive diseases in broiler chickens. the bacillus subtilis wl001 endoglucanase gene (celw) and aspergillus fumigatus wl002 phytase gene (phyw) mature peptide (phywm) were cloned into an expression vector with the lactate dehydrogenase promoter of lactobacillus casei and the secretion signal peptide of the lactococcus lactis usp45 gene. this construct was then transformed into lactobacillus reuteri xc1 that had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract  of broilers. heterologous enzyme production and feed effectiveness of this genetically modified l. reuteri strain were investigated and evaluated. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the molecular mass of phywm and celw was approximately 48.2 and 55 kda, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular weights. endoglucanase and phytase activities in the extracellular fraction of the transformed l. reuteri culture were 0.68 and 0.42 u/ml, respectively. transformed l. reuteri improved the feed conversion ratio of broilers from 21 to 42 days of age and over the whole feeding period. however, there was no effect on body weight gain and feed intake of chicks. transformed l. reuteri supplementation improved levels of ash, calcium and phosphorus in tibiae at day 21 and of phosphorus at day 42. in addition, populations of escherichia coli, veillonella spp. and bacteroides vulgatus were decreased, while populations of bifidobacterium genus and lactobacillus spp. were increased in the cecum at day 21.

TI  == anticandidal activity of cell extracts from 13 probiotic lactobacillus strains and characterisation of lactic acid and a novel fatty acid derivative from one strain.
AB  == this study investigated the anti-candida activity of methanol extracts from freeze-dried probiotic cells and the isolation of some constituents in the extracts. the mic values of the probiotic methanol cell extracts against candida  albicans ranged between 1.25 and 5mg/ml after 48 h of incubation. however, lactococcus latics subsp. lactis strain x and lactobacillus casei strain b extracts had an mic of 10mg/ml after 48 h of incubation. the extracts had fungistatic rather than fungicidal activity. these extracts had a much higher antifungal activity than antifungal compounds isolated from the growth medium by  many other authors. this indicates that probiotics may also release antifungal compounds in their cells that could contribute to a therapeutic effect. lactic acid (1) and 6-o-(alpha-d-glucopyranosyl)-1,6-di-o-pentadecanoyl-alpha-d-glucopyranose a novel fatty acid derivative (2) were isolated from methanol probiotic extracts and the  structure of these compounds were elucidated using nmr (1 and 2d) and mass spectrometry (ms).

TI  == construction of upp deletion mutant strains of lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis based on counterselective system using temperature-sensitive plasmid.
AB  == integration plasmids are often used in constructing chromosomal mutations, as it  enables the alternation of genes at any location by integration or replacement. food-grade integration vectors can integrate into the host genome without introducing any selectable markers or residual bases, and the recombination often happens in non-coding region. in this study we used the temperature-sensitive pwv01 replicon to construct 2 chloramphenicol-resistant integration plasmids (pgbhc32-upp) containing the uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (upp) gene as a counterselective marker for lactobacillus casei (l. casei) atcc393 and lactococcus lactis (l. lactis) mg1363. we then ligated the designed homologous arms to the pgbhc32-upp plasmids to allow their integration to the bacterial chromosome, and selected upp deletion mutants of l. casei atcc393 and l. lactis mg1363 in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (5-fu). analysis of genetic stability, growth curve, carbon utilization and scanning electronic microscopy showed that,  except for 5-fu resistance, there were no significant differences between the wild type and mutant lactic acid bacteria. the integration system and the upp deletion strains could be used in the insertion or deletion of genes at any location of the chromosome of both l. casei atcc 393 and l. lactis mg1363, and the homologous recombination would not introduce any selectable markers or residual bases. these mutant strains can be further investigated for heterologous protein expression and construction of a live mucosal vaccine carrier.

TI  == construction of a food-grade cell surface display system for lactobacillus casei.
AB  == in this study, a food-grade cell surface display host/vector system for lactobacillus casei was constructed. the food-grade host l. casei q-5 was a lactose-deficient derivative of l. casei atcc 334 obtained by plasmid elimination. the food-grade cell surface display vector was constructed based on  safe dna elements from lactic acid bacteria containing the following: psh71 replicon from lactococcus lactis, lactose metabolism genes from l. casei atcc 334 as complementation markers, and surface layer protein gene from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 for cell surface display. the feasibility of the new host/vector system was verified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (gfp) on l. casei. laser scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis using anti-gfp antibody confirmed that gfp was anchored on the surface of the recombinant cells. the stability of recombinant l. casei cells in artificial gastrointestinal conditions was verified, which is beneficial for oral vaccination applications. these results indicate that the food-grade host/vector  system can be an excellent antigen delivery vehicle in oral vaccine construction.

TI  == cloning and expression of a codon-optimized gene encoding the influenza a virus nucleocapsid protein in lactobacillus casei.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) species are envisioned as promising vehicles for the mucosal delivery of therapeutic and prophylactic molecules, including the development of oral vaccines. in this study, we report on the expression of a synthetic nucleocapsid (np) gene of influenza a virus in lactobacillus casei. the np gene was re-designed based on the trna pool and the codon usage preference of  l. casei bl23. the codon-optimized np gene was then cloned and expressed in l. casei rceid02 under the control of a constitutive promoter, that of the lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) gene. the synthetic np gene was further expressed in l. casei em116 under the control of an inducible promoter, that of the structural gene of  nisin (nisa) from lactococcus lactis. based on western blot analysis, the specific protein band of np, with a molecular mass of 56.0 kda, was clearly detected in both expression systems. thus, our study demonstrates the success of  expressing a codon-optimized influenza a viral gene in l. casei. the suitability  of the recombinant lab strains for immunization purposes is currently under evaluation.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == genetic engineering techniques for lactic acid bacteria: construction of a stable shuttle vector and expression vector for beta-glucuronidase.
AB  == the shuttle vector, pul6erm, was constructed by using a replicon from pl2, a multiple cloning site, cole1 ori, the ori of gram-negative bacteria from vector puc19, and the erythromycin resistance gene from pva838 as a selection marker. pul6erm could be transformed easily and maintained stably in lactococcus lactis,  streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei. transformation assays of pul6erm indicated that it had a narrow host range. beta-glucuronidase was induced in the presence of 0.3 m nacl and 50 mm glutamate  and expressed at 2.4 u mg(-1) with the expression vector (pul6erm-gadr-gus) constructed based on pul6erm carrying beta-glucuronidase gene wuth a chloride-inducible (gadr) expression cassette using pgad as promoter. therefore,  pul6erm and pul6erm-gadr-gus might be a safe and useful genetic tool for the improvement of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in japan.
AB  == to determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the japanese market, lab were isolated using deman, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and mrs agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. from 38 imported and 24 japanese cheeses, 409 lab isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. the percentage of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported  cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in japan (16.7%; p=0.04). antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in enterococcus faecalis (tetl, tetm, and ermb; tetl and ermb; tetm) e. faecium (tetm), lactococcus lactis (tets), lactobacillus (lb.), casei/paracasei (tetm or tetw), and lb. rhamnosus (ermb) isolated from seven imported cheeses. moreover, these e. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any lab isolates from japanese cheeses, lb. casei/paracasei and lb. coryniformis isolates from a japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], 32 microg/ml). leuconostoc isolates from three japanese farm-made cheeses were also  resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (mic, 32 to >512 microg/ml). in conclusion, the  present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant lab in imported and japanese farm-made cheeses on the japanese market, but not in japanese commercial cheeses.

TI  == construction and potential application of controlled autolytic systems for lactobacillus casei in cheese manufacture.
AB  == the rapid release of intracellular enzymes into the curd by the autolysis of lactic acid bacteria starters is universally recognized as a critical biological  process to accelerate cheese ripening. lactobacillus casei is typically the dominant nonstarter lactic acid bacterium in the ripening cheese. in this study,  two controlled autolytic systems were established in l. casei bl23, based on the  exploitation of the autolysins sourced from lactococcus lactis (acma) and enterococcus faecalis (atla). the lysis abilities of the systems were demonstrated both in broth and a model cheese, in which a fivefold increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity was detected in the curd with sufficient viable starter cells being maintained, indicating that they could lead to the timely release of intracellular enzymes.

TI  == a novel type of peptidoglycan-binding domain highly specific for amidated d-asp cross-bridge, identified in lactobacillus casei bacteriophage endolysins.
AB  == peptidoglycan hydrolases (pghs) are responsible for bacterial cell lysis. most pghs have a modular structure comprising a catalytic domain and a cell wall-binding domain (cwbd). pghs of bacteriophage origin, called endolysins, are  involved in bacterial lysis at the end of the infection cycle. we have characterized two endolysins, lc-lys and lc-lys-2, identified in prophages present in the genome of lactobacillus casei bl23. these two enzymes have different catalytic domains but similar putative c-terminal cwbds. by analyzing purified peptidoglycan (pg) degradation products, we showed that lc-lys is an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, whereas lc-lys-2 is a gamma-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl endopeptidase. remarkably, both lysins were able to lyse only gram-positive bacterial strains that possess pg with d-ala(4)-->d-asx-l-lys(3) in their cross-bridge, such as lactococcus casei, lactococcus lactis, and enterococcus faecium. by testing a panel of l. lactis cell wall mutants, we observed that lc-lys and lc-lys-2 were not able to lyse mutants with a modified pg cross-bridge, constituting d-ala(4)-->l-ala-(l-ala/l-ser)-l-lys(3); moreover, they do not lyse the l. lactis mutant containing only the nonamidated d-asp cross-bridge, i.e. d-ala(4)-->d-asp-l-lys(3). in contrast, lc-lys could lyse the ampicillin-resistant e. faecium mutant with 3-->3 l-lys(3)-d-asn-l-lys(3) bridges replacing the wild-type 4-->3 d-ala(4)-d-asn-l-lys(3) bridges. we showed that the c-terminal cwbd of lc-lys binds pg containing mainly d-asn but not pg with only the nonamidated d-asp-containing cross-bridge, indicating that the cwbd confers to lc-lys its narrow specificity. in conclusion, the cwbd characterized in this study is a novel type of pg-binding domain targeting specifically the d-asn interpeptide bridge of pg.

TI  == protection against human papillomavirus type 16-induced tumors in mice using non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria displaying e7 antigen at its surface.
AB  == human papillomavirus (hpv) is the causative agent of cervical cancer (cxca) and the most commonly sexually transmitted pathogen worldwide. hpv type 16 (hpv-16) e7 oncoprotein is constitutively produced in cxca and considered as a good antigen candidate for the development of new therapeutic cxca vaccines. here, we  report the use of non-genetically modified, e7-expressing lactic acid bacteria (lab) by using the cell-binding domain from lactobacillus casei a2 phage lysin as a cell wall anchor. the versatility of this system was validated by investigating e7 stability at the surface of lactococcus lactis and l. casei, two major species of lab. moreover, we demonstrated the successful use of these lab displaying e7 antigen as a mucosal live vaccine in mice. altogether, these results show the feasibility of using non-genetically modified lab for low-cost mucosal immunotherapy against hpv-related cxca in humans.

TI  == stable integration and expression of heterologous genes in several lactobacilli using an integration vector constructed from the integrase and attp sequences of  phage phiat3 isolated from lactobacillus casei atcc 393.
AB  == an integration vector capable of stably integrating and maintaining in the chromosomes of several lactobacilli over hundreds of generations has been constructed. the major integration machinery used is based on the phiat3 integrase (int) and attp sequences determined previously. a novel core sequence located at the 3' end of the trna(leu) gene is identified in lactobacillus fermentum atcc 14931 as the integration target by the integration vector though most of such sequences found in other lactobacilli are similar to that determined previously. due to the lack of an appropriate attb site in lactococcus lactis mg1363, the integration vector is found to be unable to integrate into the chromosome of the strain. however, such integration can be successfully restored  by cotransforming the integration vector with a replicative one harboring both attb and erythromycin resistance sequences into the strain. furthermore, the integration vector constructed carries a promoter region of plact from the chromosome of lactobacillus rhamnosus tcell-1 which is used to express green fluorescence and luminance protein genes in the lactobacilli studied.

TI  == construction and application of a food-grade expression system for lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a food-grade host/vector expression system for lactococcus lactis was constructed using alanine racemase gene (alr) as the complementation marker. we obtained an alanine racemase auxotrophic mutant l. lactis nz9000deltaalr by double-crossover  recombination using temperature-sensitive integration plasmid pg(+)host9 and a food-grade vector palr with entirely lactococcal dna elements, including lactococcal replicon, nisin-inducible promoter pnisa and the alr gene from lactobacillus casei bl23 as a complementation marker. by using the new food-grade host/vector system, the green fluorescent protein and capsid protein of porcine circovirus type ii were successfully overexpressed under the nisin induction. these results indicate that this food-grade host/vector expression system has application potential as an excellent antigen delivery vehicle, and is also suitable for the use in the manufacture of ingredients for the food industry.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == effects of feeding of two potentially probiotic preparations from lactic acid bacteria on the performance and faecal microflora of broiler chickens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of two probiotic preparations, containing live lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis cect 539 and lactobacillus casei cect 4043) and their products of fermentation (organic acids and bacteriocins), as a replacement for antibiotics in stimulating health and growth of broiler chickens. the effects of the supplementation of both preparations (with proven probiotic effect in weaned piglets) and an antibiotic (avilamycin) on body weight gain (bwg), feed intake (fi), feed consumption efficiency (fce), relative intestinal weight, and intestinal microbiota counts were studied in 1-day posthatch chickens. the experiments were conducted with medium-growth sasso x44 chickens housed in cages and with nutritional stressed ross 308 broiler distributed in pens. consumption of the different diets did not  affect significantly the final coliform counts in sasso x44 chickens. however, counts of lactic acid bacteria and mesophilic microorganisms were higher in the animals receiving the two probiotic preparations (p < 0.05). in the second experiment, although no differences in bwg were observed between treatments, ross 308 broilers receiving the probiotic lactobacillus preparation exhibited the lowest fce values and were considered the most efficient at converting feed into  live weight.

TI  == characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in pdo salers cheese.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making pdo salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. gerles from ten farms producing pdo salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least  4 periods spread over two years. they were distinguished by their levels of lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log cfu/cm(2)), gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log cfu/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log cfu/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log cfu/cm(2)). they were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. these 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). the farm gerles were not contaminated by salmonella, listeria monocytogenes or staphylococcus aureus. only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in the 40 l experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. using 40 l experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. they were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hilgardii,...), gram positive catalase positive bacteria (curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, curtobacterium oceanosedimentum citrococcus spp., brachybacterium rhamnosum, kocuria rhizophila, arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (kluyveromyces lactis, kluyveromyces marxianus). in less than  1 min, even in a 500 l farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.

TI  == the fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna and cdna. furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on  survival of added escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr. a high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. bacteria belonging to the genera brevibacterium, staphylococcus, escherichia, weissella, leuconostoc, pediococcus were also detected in both 16s rdna and cdna obtained from raw milk and cheeses. e. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both dna and rna extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. growth of e. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification  but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of  raw milk. growth of l. innocua and s. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all  cheeses at different stages of ripening. the use of 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing  and qrt-pcr allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.

TI  == lactococci and lactobacilli as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins  and dna vaccines.
AB  == food-grade lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been safely consumed for centuries by  humans in fermented foods. thus, they are good candidates to develop novel oral vectors, constituting attractive alternatives to attenuated pathogens, for mucosal delivery strategies. herein, this review summarizes our research, up until now, on the use of lab as mucosal delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins and dna vaccines. most of our work has been based on the model lab lactococcus lactis, for which we have developed efficient genetic tools, including expression signals and host strains, for the heterologous expression of therapeutic proteins such as antigens, cytokines and enzymes. resulting recombinant lactococci strains have been tested successfully for their prophylactic and therapeutic effects in different animal models: i) against human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16)-induced tumors in mice, ii) to partially prevent a bovine beta-lactoglobulin (blg)-allergic reaction in mice and iii) to regulate body weight and food consumption in obese mice. strikingly, all of these tools have been successfully  transposed to the lactobacillus genus, in recent years, within our laboratory. notably, anti-oxidative lactobacillus casei strains were constructed and tested in two chemically-induced colitis models. in parallel, we also developed a strategy based on the use of l. lactis to deliver dna at the mucosal level, and were able to show that l. lactis is able to modulate the host response through dna delivery. today, we consider that all of our consistent data, together with those obtained by other groups, demonstrate and reinforce the interest of using lab, particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel therapeutic protein mucosal delivery vectors which should be tested now in human  clinical trials.

TI  == lysa2, the lactobacillus casei bacteriophage a2 lysin is an endopeptidase active  on a wide spectrum of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the lysin gene (lysa2) of the lactobacillus casei bacteriophage a2 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. lysa2 is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the bond between the terminal d: -alanine of the peptidoglycan tetrapeptide and the aspartic acid residue that forms the bridge with the l: -lysine of a neighboring  peptidoglycan chain, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria included into the a4 peptidoglycan subgroup. this includes most lactobacilli, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and pediococcus pentosaceus, the walls of all of which  were substrates for the enzyme. specific binding of lysa2 to the wall of these bacteria is mediated by its c-terminal moiety, does not need the n-terminal catalytic domain for recognition, and is stable: at least 88% of the molecules were still bound to l. casei after 3 days in phosphate buffer at 4 degrees c. the enzyme acts as a monomer, is active at ph values between 4 and 6, and at temperatures ranging between 18 degrees c and 50 degrees c while being independent of divalent cation addition. the enzyme showed strong resistance to incubation at high and low ph values but became progressively inactivated at 50 degrees c and above. lysa2 is bactericidal, the viability of l. casei cultures dropping to 1% in 10 min, under the standard conditions used for the enzymatic assay.

AB  == the present work was aimed at characterizing 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to obtain improved potential starter or probiotic cultures that could be used for making dairy products from ewe's milk and cow's milk. eight strains with antimicrobial properties, isolated from ewe's milk and from cheese made from ewe's and/or cow's milk, were studied. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis (five strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (one strain of each species). additionally, four strains were obtained from the american type culture collection: lactobacillus casei 393 (isolated from cheese), l. lactis subsp. lactis 11454 (origin nonspecified and a producer of nisin), and two strains isolated from human feces (l. paracasei subsp. paracasei 27092 and lactobacillus  rhamnosus 53103, antibacterial agent producer). all e. faecalis strains showed at least one virulence factor (either hemolysin or gelatinase), which emphasizes the importance of these studies in this species. both l. lactis strains and most lactobacillus spp. were good acidifiers in ewe's milk and cow's milk at 30 degrees c. high beta-galactosidase activity, as well as aminopeptidase activities that favor the development of desirable flavors in cheese, were detected in all lactobacillus spp. strains. furthermore, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 showed alpha-fucosidase activity (thought to help colonization of the intestine) and lack of alpha-glucosidase activity (a trait considered positive for diabetic and  obese humans). this last enzymatic activity was also lacking in l. lactis atcc 11454. l. mesenteroides was the only strain d(2)-lactic acid producer. the selection of any particular strain for probiotic or dairy cultures should be performed according to the technological and/or functional abilities needed.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

(5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

AB  == background/aims: the alarming increase in allergy in the last few decades demands the development of new anti-allergic prevention strategies, and consumption of functional foods (i.e. probiotic dahi, which has already been proven to enhance immunity by modulation of the gut mucosal immune system) may be one of them. in the present study, we evaluated anti-allergic effects of a dahi (yogurt) containing probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei and normal dahi culture  lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis (named probiotic dahi) on ovalbumin induced allergy in mice. methods: allergy was induced by injecting (i.p.) ovalbumin at 0 and 14 days. animals were fed with standard diet (control), milk,  control dahi or probiotic dahi for 21 days. total and ovalbumin-specific ige, cytokines and lymphocyte proliferation index were examined after 7, 14 and 21 days. results: feeding of probiotic dahi completely suppressed the elevation of total and ovalbumin-specific ige in the serum of ovalbumin-injected mice. similarly, splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic dahi entirely lost  the total and ovalbumin-specific ige production property during in-vitro culture. production of t helper (th)-1 cell-specific cytokines, i.e. interferon -gamma and interleukin (il)-2, increased, while th2-specific cytokines, i.e. il-4 and il-6,  decreased in the supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic dahi compared to the other groups. moreover, ovalbumin-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was strongly suppressed by feeding of probiotic dahi in  comparison to milk and control dahi. conclusions: results of the present study indicate that probiotic dahi suppressed ovalbumin-induced allergic consequences characterized by decreasing levels of total and ovalbumin-specific ige and lymphocyte proliferation and skewed ovalbumin-induced th2-specific immune response towards th1-specific response.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == the effect of ripening and storage conditions on the distribution of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine in edam-cheese.
AB  == the aim of the work was to describe the development of selected biogenic amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine) in 4 layers of dutch-type cheese (edam-cheese) depending on 3 ripening/storage regimes during a 98-day period. biogenic amines were analysed by means of ion-exchange chromatography. a further  goal was to identify microbial sources of biogenic amines in the material analysed. phenotype characterization and repetitive sequence-based pcr fingerprinting were used to identify the isolated bacteria. the highest content of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine was determined in cheeses stored in a ripening cellar at a temperature of 10 degrees c during the whole observation period. lower biogenic amines content was determined in samples which were moved  into a cold storage device (5 degrees c) after 38 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees c). the lowest concentrations of biogenic amines were detected in cheeses which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees c) after 23 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees c). during the 98-day period, histamine was not detected in any of the regimes. within the cheeses analysed, non-starter lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum were detected as the main producers of the biogenic amines tested. in starter bacteria lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris the decarboxylase activity tested was not detected.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == intragastric administration of a superoxide dismutase-producing recombinant lactobacillus casei bl23 strain attenuates dss colitis in mice.
AB  == human immune cells release large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ros) such as superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide via respiratory burst. in inflammatory bowel diseases, a sustained and abnormal activation of the immune response results in oxidative stress of the digestive tract and in a loss of intestinal homeostasis. we previously reported that heterologous production of the lactobacillus plantarum manganese catalase (mnkat) enhances the survival of lb. casei bl23 when exposed to oxidative stress. anti-inflammatory effects were observed after lb. casei bl23 oral administrations in moderate murine dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis, without added effects of the mnkat production. here, we evaluated the protective effects obtained by an improved antioxidative strategy. the lactococcus lactis soda gene was expressed in lb. casei bl23 which acquired an efficient manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) activity. the effects of lb. casei mnsod alone or in combination with lb. casei mnkat were compared first in eukaryotic cell pma-induced oxidative stress model and then in severe murine dss-induced colitis. based on ros production assays as  well as colonic histological scores, a significant reduction of both oxidative stress and inflammation was observed with lb. casei mnsod either alone or in combination with lb. casei mnkat. no added effect of the presence of lb. casei mnkat was observed. these results suggest that lb. casei bl23 mnsod could have anti-inflammatory effects on gut inflammation.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional cachaca fermentations.
AB  == during the production of traditional cachaca (alembic s cachaca), contamination of the fermented must is one of the factors leading to economic losses in the beverage manufacturing industry. the diversity of bacterial populations and the role of these microorganisms during the cachaca production process are still poorly understood in brazil. in our work, the fermentation process was followed in two distilleries located in the state of minas gerais. the objective of this work was to identify the populations of lactic acid bacteria present during cachaca fermentation using physiological and molecular methods. lactic acid bacteria were isolated in high frequencies during all of the fermentative processes, and lactobacillus plantarum and l. casei were the most prevalent species. other lactic acid bacteria were found in minor frequencies, such as l. ferintoshensis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. murinus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sp. and weissella confusa. these bacteria could contribute to the increase of volatile acidity levels or to the production of compounds that could  influence the taste and aroma of the beverage.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == aims: to test whether a single vector, nisin-controlled expression (nice) system  could be used to regulate expression of the pediocin operon in streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and lactobacillus casei. methods and results: the intact pediocin operon was cloned immediately into pmsp3535 downstream of the nisa promoter (pnisa). the resulting vector, prsnped, was electrotransformed into strep. thermophilus st128, l. lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lact. casei c2. presence of the intact vector was confirmed by pcr, resulting in the amplification of a 0.8-kb dna fragment, and inhibition zones were observed for all lactic acid bacteria (lab) transformants following induction with 50 ng ml(-1) nisin, when listeria monocytogenes scott a was used as the target bacterium. using l. monocytogenes nr30 as target, the l. lactis transformants produced hazy zones of inhibition, while the lact. casei transformants produced clear zones of inhibition. zones of inhibition were not observed when the strep.  thermophilus transformants were tested against nr30. conclusions: the lab hosts were able to produce enough pediocin to inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes scott a; the growth of l. monocytogenes nr30 was effectively inhibited only by the lact. casei transformants. significance and impact of the study: this is the  first time that the nice system has been used to express the intact pediocin operon in these lab hosts. this system could allow for the in situ production of  pediocin in fermented dairy foods supplemented with nisin to prevent listeria contamination.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == pretreatment but not treatment with probiotics abolishes mouse intestinal barrier dysfunction in acute pancreatitis.
AB  == background: intestinal barrier failure during acute pancreatitis (ap) is associated with translocation of luminal bacteria, resulting in infectious complications. we examined the effects of multispecies probiotics on the intestinal barrier impairment in a murine model of ap. methods: mice were injected with cerulein to induce ap and were sacrificed 11 (early ap) or 72 hours (late ap) after start of induction. ap and associated systemic effects were confirmed by histology of pancreas and lung. animals received daily probiotics starting 2 days prior to ap induction (pretreatment) or at the moment of ap induction (treatment). mucosal barrier function of the distal ileum was assessed  in ussing chambers by measurement of the epithelial electrical resistance and the permeability to na-fluorescein. results: histological analysis revealed pancreatic injury in both phases of ap, and lung damage in the early phase. epithelial resistance of the ileum was reduced and permeability increased in both phases of ap, indicating impairment of the intestinal barrier. pretreatment had no effect on resistance or permeability in the early phase of ap. in the late phase of ap, pretreatment but not treatment abolished the ap induced resistance decrease and permeability increase. administration of probiotics as such (ie, without induction of ap) had no effect on intestinal barrier function. conclusion: pretreatment with multispecies probiotics for 2 days abolishes intestinal barrier dysfunction in the late phase of ap, while treatment does not. the effectiveness of probiotics in this model depends on the timing of administration. clinical trials with probiotics should seek conditions where treatment can be started prior to onset of disease or elective surgical intervention.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (sbd) of the *-amylase of streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in escherichia  coli. the fusion protein (cph-sbd) was able to bind to the cell surface of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441 and to corn starch. therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. at a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of l. casei did not form any  aggregates with corn starch. after incubation in simulated gastric juice (ph 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. when cph-sbd-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. the survival of the amylose-coated cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of cph-sbd-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. these  results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.

TI  == genome sequence and characteristics of lrm1, a prophage from industrial lactobacillus rhamnosus strain m1.
AB  == prophage lrm1 was induced with mitomycin c from an industrial lactobacillus rhamnosus starter culture, m1. electron microscopy of the lysate revealed relatively few intact bacteriophage particles among empty heads and disassociated tails. the defective siphoviridae phage had an isometric head of approximately 55 nm and noncontractile tail of about 275 nm with a small baseplate. in repeated attempts, the prophage could not be cured from l. rhamnosus m1, nor could a sensitive host be identified. sequencing of the phage lrm1 dna revealed a genome  of 39,989 bp and a g+c content of 45.5%. a similar genomic organization and mosaic pattern of identities align lrm1 among the closely related lactobacillus casei temperate phages a2, phiat3, and lcai and with l. rhamnosus virulent phage  lu-nu. of the 54 open reading frames (orfs) identified, all but 8 shared homology with other phages of this group. five unknown orfs were identified that had no homologies in the databases nor predicted functions. notably, lrm1 encodes a putative endonuclease and a putative dna methylase with homology to a methylase in lactococcus lactis phage tuc2009. possibly, the dna methylase, endonuclease, or other lrm1 genes provide a function crucial to l. rhamnosus m1 survival, resulting in the stability of the defective prophage in its lysogenic state. the  presence of a defective prophage in an industrial strain could provide superinfection immunity to the host but could also contribute dna in recombination events to produce new phages potentially infective for the host strain in a large-scale fermentation environment.

TI  == improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the bifidobacterium catenulatum pbc1 replicon.
AB  == this study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pbc1, a cryptic plasmid from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. these vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in lactococcus lactis or lactobacillus casei. they showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good  segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the laczalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in escherichia coli. the functionality of the vectors for engineering bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to bifidobacterium longum. e. coli and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the  agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph  range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.

TI  == expression of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus  lactis il1403 in methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris.
AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 produced intracellularly in escherichia coli was able to attach to the surface of cells of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441, bacillus subtilis 168, e. coli xl1-blue and saccharomyces cerevisiae ifo0216. therefore, this domain is a suitable fusion partner for the adhesion of proteins to cell surfaces. the production of cell-surface adhesive proteins using this domain in pichia pastoris is particularly attractive, because this organism has better capability to allow  the correct folding of the recombinant proteins than prokaryotic hosts. however,  when this domain is produced in this yeast, its cell-surface binding activity may be limited by glycosylation. in this study, therefore, we constructed a cph mutant (cphm) devoid of the potential n-glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. cphm was successfully expressed extracellularly in p. pastoris (gs115) using the methanol inducible aox1 promoter with an alpha-mating factor signal sequence, whereas the native cph was not produced in this host. western blot analysis revealed that the apparent molecular size of cphm was 18 kda greater than that of cph produced in e. coli (32 kda), which is attributed to o-glycosylation. however, cphm produced in p. pastoris was capable of binding to  the cell surfaces despite its modification by the yeast, and its dissociation rate constant from the surface of l. casei nrrl b-441 cells was 3.5-fold lower than that of cph produced in e. coli. these results demonstrate the applicability of the constructed domain (cphm) for the production of cell-surface adhesive proteins in p. pastoris.

TI  == microbial dynamics of castelmagno pdo, a traditional italian cheese, with a focus on lactic acid bacteria ecology.
AB  == the dynamics of dominant microflora throughout the manufacture and ripening processes were evaluated in three batches of traditional castelmagno pdo cheese.  milk, curd and cheese samples, at different stages during cheesemaking, were collected and subjected to culture-dependent and -independent analysis. traditional plating and genetic identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates, and pcr-dgge analysis of v1 region of 16s rrna gene were carried out. the collected samples were also monitored by hplc for the presence of organic acids, sugars and ketones. lab resulted to be the prevailing microflora in all production stages although enterococci, coagulase-negative cocci and yeasts also  showed considerable viable counts probably related to the presence, in the dairy  samples analysed, of free short-chain fatty acids detected by hplc. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the species most frequently isolated during castelmagno  pdo manufacture, while lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus paracasei were isolated with the highest frequencies from ripened castelmagno pdo cheese samples. occasionally strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens and lactobacillus casei were isolated. the results obtained on castelmagno pdo microflora underlines a partial correspondence between culture-dependent method and dgge analysis. thus, in this  study, it is highlighted once more the importance to combine molecular culture-independent approaches with classical microbiological methods for the study of complex environmental communities occurring in food matrices.

AB  == type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm) is an auto-immune disease while oral administrating its autoantigens could be a treatment of t1dm. to express human insulin gene (ins) in lactic acid bacteria (lab) for oral vaccine, ins gene was replaced by lab bias codon and an 8-amino-acid-residue linker peptide forming a beta-turn was designed to link insulin chain a and b. after synthesized by primer annealing method, the whole ins gene was fused with signal peptide sequence sp(usp45), subcloned into a lab secretory expressive vector psw501 and then introduced to lactococcus lactis (l. lactis) mg1363 and lactobacillus casei (lb.  casei ) atcc27092 respectively. western blot showed that the expression product (sp(usp45)-ins protein) targeted mainly at the cell wall while little was found in cytoplasm or supernatant. the highest expression level emerged in exponential  phase when the optical density at 600nm of the culture was 0.4. the culture of the recombinant strain lb. casei/psw501 was administered to non-obese diabetic (nod) mice orally. elisa and western blot results showed that the recombinant strain could induce sp(usp45)-ins-specific antibodies and raise il-4 level (38.583 +/- 2.083 pg/ml, p < 0.05) in the mice' s sera. expression of insulin in  the food-grade vehicle lab could induce oral immune tolerance in nod mice and protect it from pancreas injury, suggesting it might be a new way to the treatment of t1dm.

TI  == influence of selected lab cultures on the evolution of free amino acids, free fatty acids and fiore sardo cheese microflora during the ripening.
AB  == fiore sardo protected denomination of origin is a traditional sardinian (italy) hard cheese produced exclusively from whole raw ovine milk and coagulated with lamb rennet paste. currently, fiore sardo is still produced by shepherds at the farmhouse level without the addition of any starter culture and the cheese-making process is characterized by significant waste. the first objective of the present work was to investigate the autochthonous microflora present in milk and fiore sardo cheese in order to select lactic acid bacterial (lab) cultures with suitable cheese-making attributes and, possibly reduce the production waste. secondly, the ability of selected cultures to guarantee cheese healthiness and quality was tested in experimental cheese-making trials. in this study, we show that the typical lactic microflora of raw ewe's milk and fiore sardo cheese is mostly composed of mesophilic lab such as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei subsp. casei. moreover, strains belonging to the species were selected for cheese-making attributes and used in experimental cheese-making trials carried out in different farms producing fiore  sardo. the evolution of the cheese microflora, free amino acids and free fatty acids during the ripening showed that the experimental cheeses were characterized by a balanced ratio of the chemical constituents, by a reduced number of spoilage microorganisms and, remarkably, by the absence of production waste that were significant for the control cheeses.

TI  == system using tandem repeats of the ca peptidoglycan-binding domain from lactococcus lactis for display of both n- and c-terminal fusions on cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the c terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (ca domain) of acma (a major autolysin from lactococcus lactis). western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (ca-amya) of the ca domain and alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 (amya) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of l. lactis cells. amya was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. moreover, with an increase in the number of ca domains, the quantity of ca-amya fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. when three repeats of the ca domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. the raw starch-degrading activity of amya was significantly higher when amya was fused to the c terminus of the ca domain than when it was fused to the n terminus. in addition, ca-amya fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei.

TI  == mutational and biochemical analyses of the endolysin lys(gay) encoded by the lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t phage phi gay.
AB  == the lys(gay) of lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131(t) phage phigay endolysin was purified to homogeneity using the escherichia coli/his.tag system. zymographic and spectrophotometric assays showed that lys(gay) lysed over 20 heated gram-positive bacterial species as the substrates, including lactobacilli, lactococci, enterococci, micrococci, and staphylococci. the enzymatic activity had the ph and temperature optima of about 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively. amino-acid substitution analysis revealed that 13 residues of lys(gay) were involved in cell-lytic activity: in the beta/alpha(gay) domain, g10, d12, e33, d36, h60, y61, d96, e98, v124, l132, and d198; in the sh3b(gay) domain, y272 and  w284. in addition, deletion analysis demonstrated that the beta/alpha(gay) domain of n-terminal 216 residues is the core enzyme portion, although the cell-lytic ability is lower than that of lys(gay). these mutational experiments suggested that beta/alpha(gay) (in which two acidic residues of d12 and e98 likely act as catalytic residues) is responsible for cell-lytic activity, and sh3b(gay) promotes beta/alpha(gay) possibly through cell-wall binding function. the purified his-tagged sh3b(gay) domain containing 94 residues from s217 to k310 (i) bound to gram-positive bacteria susceptible to lys(gay), (ii) induced aggregation of exponentially growing cells of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t), l. casei iam 1045, lactococcus lactis c2, l. lactis mg 1363, and enterococcus hirae iam 1262 by forming thread-like chained cells, (iii) inhibited lytic activity of lys(gay), and (iv) impeded autolysis of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t) in buffer systems. a truncated protein hdeltash3b(gay) lacking in n-terminal 21 residues (from s217 to e237) of sh3b(gay) and an amino-acid substituted protein hsh3b(gay)g (w284g) lost the activities of hsh3b(gay), showing that the n-terminal region and w284 probably play important roles in the sh3b(gay) function(s).

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  == background & aims: although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the  final design of the probiotic. specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. methods: from a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a  simulated gastrointestinal environment. functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. results: specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10.  based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (ecologic 641); bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis. combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of il-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. conclusions: application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.

TI  == efficient production and secretion of bovine beta-lactoglobulin by lactobacillus  casei.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are attractive tools to deliver therapeutic molecules at the mucosal level. the model lab lactococcus lactis has  been intensively used to produce and deliver such heterologous proteins. however, compared to recombinant lactococci, lactobacilli offer some advantages such as better survival in the digestive tract and immunomodulatory properties. here, we  compared different strategies to optimize the production of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (blg), a major cow's milk allergen, in the probiotic strain lactobacillus casei bl23. results: using a nisin-inducible plasmid system, we first showed that l. casei bl23 strain could efficiently secrete a reporter protein, the staphylococcal nuclease (nuc), with the lactococcal signal peptide spusp45 fused to its n-terminus. the fusion of spusp45 failed to drive blg secretion but led to a 10-fold increase of intracellular blg production. secretion was significantly improved when the synthetic propeptide leisstcda (hereafter called leiss) was added to the n-terminus of the mature moiety of blg. secretion rate of leiss-blg was 6-fold higher than that of blg alone while intracellular production reached then about 1 mg/l of culture. the highest yield  of secretion was obtained by using nuc as carrier protein. insertion of nuc between leiss and blg resulted in a 20-fold increase in blg secretion, up to 27 microg/l of culture. furthermore, the lactococcal nisrk regulatory genes were integrated into the bl23 chromosome. the nisrk insertion allowed a decrease of blg synthesis in uninduced cultures while blg production increased by 50% after nisin induction. moreover, modification of the induction protocol led to increase the proportion of soluble blg to around 74% of the total blg production. conclusion: blg production and secretion in l. casei were significantly improved  by fusions to a propeptide enhancer and a carrier protein. the resulting recombinant strains will be further tested for their ability to modulate the immune response against blg via mucosal delivery in a cow's milk allergy model in mice.

TI  == production of a heterologous nonheme catalase by lactobacillus casei: an efficient tool for removal of h2o2 and protection of lactobacillus bulgaricus from oxidative stress in milk.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally sensitive to h2o2, a compound that they  can paradoxically produce themselves, as is the case for lactobacillus bulgaricus. lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14431 is one of the very few lab strains able to degrade h2o2 through the action of a nonheme, manganese-dependent catalase (hereafter called mnkat). the mnkat gene was expressed in three catalase-deficient lab species: l. bulgaricus atcc 11842, lactobacillus casei bl23, and lactococcus lactis mg1363. while the protein could be detected in all heterologous hosts, enzyme activity was observed only in l. casei. this is probably due to the differences in the mn contents of the cells, which are reportedly similar in l. plantarum and l. casei but at least 10- and 100-fold lower in lactococcus lactis and l. bulgaricus, respectively. the expression of the mnkat gene in l. casei conferred enhanced oxidative stress resistance, as measured by an increase in the survival rate after exposure to h2o2, and improved long-term survival in aerated cultures. in mixtures of l. casei producing mnkat and l. bulgaricus, l. casei can eliminate h2o2 from the culture medium, thereby protecting both l. casei and l. bulgaricus from its deleterious effects.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

AB  == mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. the induction of protective iga in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. in this work, streptococcus pneumoniae psaa antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus helveticus. after nasal inoculation of c57bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (igg in serum) and mucosal (iga in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-psaa antibodies was determined. immunization with l. lactis mg1363 induced very low levels of iga and igg, possibly by the low amount of psaa expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. all three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of psaa protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) cfu). however, l. plantarum ncdo1193 and l. helveticus atcc15009 elicited the highest antibody response (iga and igg). vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant l. lactis led  to a decrease in s. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. our results confirm that certain lactobacillus strains have intrinsic  properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == the glycolytic genes pfk and pyk from lactobacillus casei are induced by sugars transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system and repressed by ccpa.
AB  == in lactobacillus casei bl23, phosphofructokinase activity was higher in cells utilizing sugars transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase  system (pts). the phosphofructokinase gene (pfk) was cloned from l. casei and shown to be clustered with the gene encoding pyruvate kinase (pyk). pfk and pyk genes are cotranscribed and induced upon growth on sugars transported by the pts. contrarily to the model proposed for lactococcus lactis, where the global catabolite regulator protein (ccpa) is involved in pts-induced transcription of pfk and pyk, a ccpa mutation resulted in a slight increase in pfk-pyk expression  in l. casei. this weak regulation was evidenced by ccpa binding to a region of the pfk-pyk promoter which contained two cre sequences significantly deviated from the consensus. the pts induction of pfk-pyk seems to be counteracted by the  ccpa-mediated repression. our results suggest that the need to accommodate the levels of pfk-pyk mrna to the availability of sugars is fulfilled in l. casei by  a pts/ccpa-mediated signal transduction different from l. lactis.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == homofermentative lactic acid bacteria of a traditional cheese, comlek peyniri from cappadocia region.
AB  == comlek peyniri is a typical artisanal cheese in central anatolia. this type of cheese was made by using the indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora of cow or ewes' milk. majority of the samples were taken from fresh cheese because the aim was to isolate homofermentative lab. initially 661 microbial isolates were obtained from 17 cheese samples. only 107 were found to be homofermentative lab.  these isolates were selected and identified by using both phenotypic and molecular methods. phenotypic identification included curd formation from skim milk, catalase test, gram staining and light microscopy, growth at different temperatures and salt concentrations, arginine hydrolysis, gas production from glucose, and carbohydrate fermentation. molecular identification was based on the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) of  the 16s rrna gene-its (internally transcribed spacer) region. by combining the phenotypic and molecular identification results, isolates belonging to each of the following genera were determined at species or subspecies level: 54 lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 3 ec. faecalis, 2 ec.  durans, 10 ec. sp., 15 lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and 2 lb. casei  strains. technological characterisation was also performed by culturing each of the strains in uht skim milk, and by monitoring ph change and lactic acid production at certain time intervals through the 24 h incubation. results of the  technological characterisation indicated that 33% of the isolates (35 strains) were capable of lowering the ph of uht milk below 5.3 after 6 h incubation at 30  degrees c. thirty four of these strains were lc. lactis subsp. lactis, and only one was an ec. faecium strain.

TI  == free fatty acid accumulation by mesophilic lactic acid bacteria in cold-stored milk.
AB  == this study was aimed to determine the accumulation of free fatty acid by mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 1471, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 1000 and lactobacillus casei 111) in cold-stored milk. according to the results, all cold-stored milks had higher acid degree values than those of fresh milk. this phenomenon showed that a slight increase occurred in the accumulation of free fatty acids as a result of spontaneous lipolysis during cold storage. all lactic acid bacteria showed good performance in production of titratable acidity, which increased during fermentation of the milk (fresh and stored milks). moreover, as the storage time  was prolonged, more free fatty acid accumulation was obtained from the fermentation of the cold-stored milk by the investigated lactic acid bacteria. the control milk, which was without lactic acid bacteria, showed no change in the accumulation of free fatty acid during fermentation. from this result, it can be  suggested that longer cold-storage time can induce higher free fatty acid accumulation in milk by lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == overexpression of lactobacillus casei d-hydroxyisocaproic acid dehydrogenase in cheddar cheese.
AB  == metabolism of aromatic amino acids by lactic acid bacteria is an important source of off-flavor compounds in cheddar cheese. previous work has shown that alpha-keto acids produced from trp, tyr, and phe by aminotransferase enzymes are  chemically labile and may degrade spontaneously into a variety of off-flavor compounds. however, dairy lactobacilli can convert unstable alpha-keto acids to more-stable alpha-hydroxy acids via the action of alpha-keto acid dehydrogenases  such as d-hydroxyisocaproic acid dehydrogenase. to further characterize the role  of this enzyme in cheese flavor, the lactobacillus casei d-hydroxyisocaproic acid dehydrogenase gene was cloned into the high-copy-number vector ptrkh2 and transformed into l. casei atcc 334. enzyme assays confirmed that alpha-keto acid  dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher in ptrkh2:dhic transformants than in wild-type cells. reduced-fat cheddar cheeses were made with lactococcus lactis starter only, starter plus l. casei atcc 334, and starter plus l. casei atcc 334  transformed with ptrkh2:dhic. after 3 months of aging, the cheese chemistry and flavor attributes were evaluated instrumentally by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by descriptive sensory analysis. the culture system used significantly affected the concentrations of various ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters and one sulfur compound in cheese. results further indicated that enhanced expression of d-hydroxyisocaproic acid dehydrogenase suppressed spontaneous degradation of alpha-keto acids, but sensory work indicated that this effect retarded cheese flavor development.

AB  == despite the fact that almost 39% of the theoretical expressed proteins of lactococcus lactis have a predicted isoelectric point above 7, these proteins have not been studied in previous proteome analyses. in the present study, we set up a reference map of alkaline lactococcal proteins by using immobilized ph gradients (ipg) spanning ph 6 to 12 and 9 to 12, and protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). different electrophoresis systems for isoelectric focusing were evaluated to optimize the first dimension. best results were obtained by sample application using cup-loading at the anodic side and increasing the final voltage up to 8000 v for ipgs, using n,n-dimethylacrylamide as monomer. after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of extracts obtained from exponentially growing cells, about 200 protein spots were selected for identification by peptide mass fingerprinting. with maldi-tof ms, 153 proteins were identified that were the products of 85 different genes. their predicted isoelectric points range from as high as 11.31 to as low as 6.34. ribosomal proteins, hypothetical proteins and proteins with unknown function represent the largest groups of identified proteins. for further classification, the codon adaptation index (cai) and grand average of hydropathicity (gravy) for each lactococcal protein were calculated. the protein with the lowest cai identified in this study is the manganese abc transporter atp-binding protein. less than 10% of the alkaline lactococcal proteins have a smaller cai. the highest gravy for an identified protein is 0.26. the complete in silico data of lactococcus lactis as well as clickable reference maps are available at www.wzw.tum.de/proteomik/lactis.

AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  == the c-terminal region (ca) of the major autolysin acma of lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (lysm domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. the ca domain could be  deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. this acma derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete.  the ca domain and a chimeric protein consisting of ca fused to the c terminus of  msa2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via ca. the fusion protein also bound to many other gram-positive bacteria. by chemical treatment of purified cell walls of l. lactis and bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with ca. immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, b. subtilis, lactobacillus sake, and lactobacillus casei cells. based on these studies, we propose that lysm-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of acma. lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. for l. lactis sk110,  it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no msa2ca binding is observed.

TI  == food-grade host/vector expression system for lactobacillus casei based on complementation of plasmid-associated phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg.
AB  == a new food-grade host/vector system for lactobacillus casei based on lactose selection was constructed. the wild-type non-starter host lb. casei strain e utilizes lactose via a plasmid-encoded phosphotransferase system. for food-grade  cloning, a stable lactose-deficient mutant was constructed by deleting a 141-bp fragment from the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg via gene replacement. the  deletion resulted in an inactive phospho-beta-galactosidase enzyme with an internal in-frame deletion of 47 amino acids. a complementation plasmid was constructed containing a replicon from lactococcus lactis, the lacg gene from lb. casei, and the constitutive promoter of pepr for lacg expression from lb. rhamnosus. the expression of the lacg gene from the resulting food-grade plasmid  pleb600 restored the ability of the lactose-negative mutant strain to grow on lactose to the wild-type level. the vector pleb600 was used for expression of the proline iminopeptidase gene pepi from lb. helveticus in lb. casei. the results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper can be used for expression of foreign genes in lb. casei.

TI  == esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

TI  == antibacterial activities of nisin z encapsulated in liposomes or produced in situ by mixed culture during cheddar cheese ripening.
AB  == this study investigated both the activity of nisin z, either encapsulated in liposomes or produced in situ by a mixed starter, against listeria innocua, lactococcus spp., and lactobacillus casei subsp. casei and the distribution of nisin z in a cheddar cheese matrix. nisin z molecules were visualized using gold-labeled anti-nisin z monoclonal antibodies and transmission electron microscopy (immune-tem). experimental cheddar cheeses were made using a nisinogenic mixed starter culture, containing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ul 719 as the nisin producer and two nisin-tolerant lactococcal strains and l. casei subsp. casei as secondary flora, and ripened at  7 degrees c for 6 months. in some trials, l. innocua was added to cheese milk at  10(5) to 10(6) cfu/ml. in 6-month-old cheeses, 90% of the initial activity of encapsulated nisin (280 +/- 14 iu/g) was recovered, in contrast to only 12% for initial nisin activity produced in situ by the nisinogenic starter (300 +/- 15 iu/g). during ripening, immune-tem observations showed that encapsulated nisin was located mainly at the fat/casein interface and/or embedded in whey pockets while nisin produced by biovar diacetylactis ul 719 was uniformly distributed in  the fresh cheese matrix but concentrated in the fat area as the cheeses aged. cell membrane in lactococci appeared to be the main nisin target, while in l. casei subsp. casei and l. innocua, nisin was more commonly observed in the cytoplasm. cell wall disruption and digestion and lysis vesicle formation were common observations among strains exposed to nisin. immune-tem observations suggest several modes of action for nisin z, which may be genus and/or species specific and may include intracellular target-specific activity. it was concluded that nisin-containing liposomes can provide a powerful tool to improve nisin stability and availability in the cheese matrix.

TI  == the dilemma of phage taxonomy illustrated by comparative genomics of sfi21-like siphoviridae in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete genome sequences of two dairy phages, streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201 and lactobacillus casei phage a2, are reported. comparative genomics reveals that both phages are members of the recently proposed sfi21-like genus of siphoviridae, a widely distributed phage type in low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. graded relatedness, the hallmark of evolving biological systems, was observed when different sfi21-like phages were compared. across the structural module, the graded relatedness was represented by a high level of dna sequence similarity or protein sequence similarity, or a shared gene map in the absence of sequence relatedness. this varying range of relatedness was found within sfi21-like phages from a single species as demonstrated by the different prophages harbored by lactococcus lactis strain il1403. a systematic dot plot analysis with 11 complete l. lactis phage genome sequences revealed a clear separation of all temperate phages from two classes of virulent phages. the temperate lactococcal phages share dna sequence homology in a patchwise fashion over the nonstructural gene cluster. with respect to structural genes, four dna homology groups could be defined within temperate l. lactis phages. closely related structural modules for all four dna homology groups were detected in phages from streptococcus or listeria, suggesting that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages that have not uniquely evolved in l. lactis. it seems reasonable to base phage taxonomy on data from comparative genomics. however, the peculiar modular nature of phage evolution creates ambiguities in the definition  of phage taxa by comparative genomics. for example, depending on the module on which the classification is based, temperate lactococcal phages can be classified as a single phage species, as four distinct phage species, or as two if not three different phage genera. we propose to base phage taxonomy on comparative genomics of a single structural gene module (head or tail genes). this partially phylogeny-based taxonomical system still mirrors some aspects of the current international committee on taxonomy in virology classification system. in this system the currently sequenced lactococcal phages would be grouped into five genera: c2-, sk1, sfi11-, r1t-, and sfi21-like phages.

TI  == the evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == isolation, identification and changes in the composition of lactic acid bacteria  during the malting of two different barley cultivars.
AB  == malt has a complex microbial population, which changes as the malting process commences. little is known about the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria (lab)  in each of the malting phases. in this study, we determined the number of lab present in the different phases of malting with clipper and prisma barley cultivars. the strains were identified to species level by using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, rapd-pcr banding patterns and 16s rrna sequencing. the number of viable lab in the barley before steep was higher in prisma than clipper (7.6 x 10(4) and 1.2 x 10(3) cfu/g, respectively).  despite this, the number of viable cells recorded in the first steep water was slightly higher for clipper (9.0 x 10(5) cfu/g) than prisma (5.5 x 10(5) cfu/g).  more or less, the same cell numbers were recorded for the two barley cultivars after the first and second dry stands. both cultivars displayed more or less the  same cell numbers (3.7 x 10(7) for clipper and 3.2 x 10(7) cfu/g for prisma) after the third day of germination. however, a higher number of lab were detected in the kilned prisma malt (6.9 x 10(4) cfu/g) than the clipper malt (1.5 x 10(4)  cfu/g). leuconostoc argentinum, le. lactis and weissella confusa were the most predominant in both cultivars. a few strains were identified as w. paramesenteroides (four strains), lactobacillus casei (five strains), lactococcus lactis (five strains) and lb. rhamnosus (two strains). lb. casei and lb. rhamnosus were not isolated from the prisma cultivar, while w. paramesenteroides  and lc. lactis were absent in the clipper cultivar. kilned malt of the clipper cultivar contained predominantly le. argentinum, whereas the prisma cultivar contained mainly lc. lactis. to our knowledge. this is the first report of lab in clipper and prisma barley and the various malting phases. the influence of the various groups of lactic acid bacteria on the fermenting ability of brewers' yeast is currently being determined.

TI  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. for this aim, a total of 48 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. the detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized  by growth kinetics. a variety of interactions was demonstrated. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit s. thermophilus strains. among  probiotic cultures, lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (lb. casei and bifidobacterium). in general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. the study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). the possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and  their survival in the products during cold storage.

TI  == construction of compatible wide-host-range shuttle vectors for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == a new collection of shuttle cloning vectors has been constructed that can be used in a broad host range, because they carry replication origins which are functional in escherichia coli (p15a, pwv01, cole1), lactococcus lactis, lactobacilli, and bacillus subtilis (pambeta1, pwv01). these plasmids contain the lacz-t1t2 cassette from pjdc9, which allows the x-gal selection and cloning of dna fragments that could cause plasmid instability in e. coli. in addition, they  have been proved to be structurally and segregationally stable in lactobacillus casei, in which their copy number has been determined by real-time quantitative pcr. furthermore, the antibiotic resistance markers (beta-lactamase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, and erythromycin transacetylase) and the theta and rolling circle replicating origins have been combined to obtain this set of compatible plasmids (pia family) that can be cotransformed, both in lactic acid bacteria and in e. coli.

TI  == lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  == fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of lactobacillus casei strain shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. dna for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes atcc 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction,  cloned into a surface display vector psak332, and introduced into l. casei. the fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of lactococcus lactis ncdo 763. the fibronectin binding ability of the resulting l. casei was confirmed with western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. these results indicate that l. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. this l. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.

TI  == characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest argentina.
AB  == indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest argentina. mean growth counts on m17, mrs, and mse agar media did not show significant differences (p < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. isolates of  lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as enterococcus (48%), lactococci  (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). all lactococci were identified  as lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. l. plantarum (93%), l. acidophilus (5%), and lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. l. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers.  l. plantarum and l. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. the majority of the lactobacilli and lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. enzyme activities (api-zym tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of l. plantarum strains were considerably higher. the predominance of l. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.

AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

(one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == characterization of the lactococcus lactis transcription factor flpa and demonstration of an in vitro switch.
AB  == the commercially important bacterium lactococcus lactis contains two fnr-like proteins (flpa and flpb) which have a high degree of identity to each other and to the flp of lactobacillus casei. flpa was isolated from a gst-flpa fusion protein produced in escherichia coli. like flp, isolated flpa is a homodimeric protein containing both zn and cu. however, the properties of flpa were more like those of the e. coli oxygen-responsive transcription factor fnr than the flp of l. casei. as prepared flpa recognized an fnr site (ttgat-n4-atcaa) but not an flp site (cctga-n4-tcagg) in band-shift assays. in contrast to flp, dna binding by flpa did not require the formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond. however, despite containing only two cysteine residues per monomer, flpa was able to acquire an fnr-like, oxygen-labile [4fe 4s] cluster. but, whereas the incorporation of a [4fe 4s] cluster into fnr enhances interaction with target dna, it abolished dna binding by flpa. an flpa variant (flpa') with an n-terminal region designed to be more flp-like failed to incorporate an iron-sulphur cluster but could now form an intramolecular disulphide. this simple example of protein engineering, converting an oxygen-labile [4fe 4s] containing fnr-like protein into a dithiol-disulphide flp-like redox sensor demonstrates the versatility of the basic crp structure. attempts to demonstrate an flpa-based aerobic-anaerobic  switch in the heterologous host e. coli were unsuccessful. however, studies with  a series of fnr-dependent lac reporter fusions in strains of e. coli expressing flpa or flpb revealed that both homologues were able to activate expression of fnr-dependent promoters in vivo but only when positioned 61 base pairs upstream of the transcription start.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

AB  == spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, mrs and rm, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of spirulina platensis in zarrouk medium. in both mrs and rm media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic  acid bacteria assayed. this stimulatory effect was observed in media with ph adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. no effect was observed in minimal saline medium.

TI  == crystal structures of a unique thermal-stable thymidylate synthase from bacillus  subtilis.
AB  == unlike all other organisms studied to date, bacillus subtilis expresses two different thymidylate synthases: bsts-a and bsts-b. bsts-a displays enhanced enzymatic and structural thermal stability uncharacteristic of most tss. despite  the high level of ts conservation across most species, bsts-a shares low sequence identity (<40%) with the majority of tss from other organisms. this ts and the tss from lactococcus lactis and phage phi3t-to which it is most similar-have been of interest for some time since, by structure-based sequence alignment, they appear to lack several key residues shown by mutagenesis to be essential to enzymatic function [greene, p. j., yu, p. l., zhao, j., schiffer, c. a., and santi, d. (1994) protein sci. 3, 1114-6]. in addition, bsts-a demonstrates specific activity 2-3-fold higher than ts from lactobacillus casei or escherichia coli. we have solved the crystal structure of this unusual ts in four crystal forms to a maximum resolution of 1.7 a. each of these crystal forms contains either one or two noncrystallographically related dimers. stabilization of the beta-sheet dimer interface through a dramatic architecture of buttressed internal salt bridges maintains the structural integrity of bsts-a at elevated temperatures. melting curves of tss from l. casei and e. coli are compared to that of ts-a from b. subtilis and correlated with numbers of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and the numbers of interactions localized to the dimer interface. analysis of this structure will shed light on the conservation of function across diversity of sequence, as well as provide insights into the thermal stabilization of a highly conserved enzyme.

TI  == autolysis of lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and lactobacillus casei ssp. casei. cell lysis induced by a crude bacteriocin.
AB  == autolytic properties of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ifpl359, its lac prt derivative lc. lactis tl and lactobacillus casei subsp. casei ifpl731, used as starter and adjunct starter in goat's milk cheese making, have been studied. the  lytic effect of a bacteriocin produced by a lactic acid bacterium isolated from raw goat's milk has also been analyzed. lactococcal cells resuspended in phosphate buffer showed a peak of autolysis when they were harvested in the early growth phase. a more stable autolytic pattern through the exponential growth was  obtained for lb. casei ifpl731. optimal autolysis was found in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer during incubation at 40 degrees c for lb. casei ifpl731 and at 35 degrees c for the lactococci. thermoinduction of cell lysis was not obtained in any of the cases under the conditions studied. lytic effect of the crude bacteriocin assayed was strongest against lc. lactis tl. lysis response to the bacteriocin seemed to be strain-dependent and related to growth conditions.

TI  == isolation and characterization of promoters from the lactobacillus casei temperate bacteriophage a2.
AB  == random sau3a1 dna fragments from the temperate lactobacillus bacteriophage a2 were cloned into the promoter-probe plasmid pgkv210. seven dna fragments with promoter activity were selected, after transformation of escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis, subsp, lactis, through the chloramphenicol resistance they conferred to the corresponding clones. the seven promoters were functional in lactobacillus casei. their strength was analysed by measuring the levels of chloramphenicol resistance and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity induced in each host. the nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined and primer extension analysis was used to locate the initiation site of transcription from each promoter in e coli. the promoters contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequences of e. coli and lactobacillus promoters.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

TI  == the lac operon of lactobacillus casei contains lact, a gene coding for a protein  of the bg1g family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  == the 5' region of the lac operon of lactobacillus casei has been investigated. an  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lact, was identified upstream of lace. the gene product encoded by lact is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes bglg from escherichia coli, arbg from erwinia chrysanthemi, sact, sacy, and lict from bacillus subtilis, and bglr from lactococcus lactis. amino acid sequence identities range  from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. the transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lact. the corresponding mrna would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus rna binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. lact was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a b. subtilis test system using the sacb target sequence. lact directly precedes lacegf, the genes coding for enzyme iicb, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme iia, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. northern hybridizations  with probes against lact, lace, and lacf revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mrnas of several l. casei strains. since the length of the lac mrna is just sufficient to contain lactegf, we conclude that the lac operon of l. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == chemical composition of the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  == in order to examine the relationship between biological activities and the cell wall content, the murein type and the teichoic acid of the cell wall from five strains of bacteria were studied. two of these lactobacillus casei crl 431 and l. acidophilus crl 730, are used in a commercial fermented milk (bio milk), which is believed to be beneficial for health. the other strains, lactococcus lactis crl 526, pediococcus pentosaceus crl 923 and propionibacterium acidipropionici crl 1198 were included in order to compare the cell wall structures of active and inactive strains. a method was designed to confirm the amino acids of the peptidoglycan in impure substrates. four of the studied strains, l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. lactis and p. acidipropionici, contained glycerol teichoic acids. l. casei, l. acidophilus, p. pentosaceus and l. lactis contained a4 alpha type murein, while p. acidipropionici contained a3 gamma type. the capacity of orally  administered peptidoglycans of the studied strains to stimulate phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages was analyzed. only the pg of l. casei showed this activity. no differences were observed between active and inactive strains with respect to the chemical composition of the peptidoglycan. therefore the biological activity is unlikely to be due to the peptidoglycan structure.

AB  == this study describes the expression of the zymomonas mobilis genes coding for pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) in lactobacillus casei 686. to promote transcription, the promoter and ribosome binding site (rbs) from the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-derived vector, pmge36e, were inserted  upstream of the pdc gene. the former sequences were positioned such that translation of pdc was coupled to translation of an 81-base pair open reading frame terminating within the pdc initiation site. the recombinant plasmid (prsg02) was electroporated into l. casei, and transformants were obtained. northern analysis confirmed the production of a 3. 1-kb transcript corresponding  to the predicted size of the pet operon. western blot analyses revealed that the  recombinant strain expressed both enzymes. the recombinant produced more than twice the ethanol produced by the parental l. casei strain.

TI  == immunological and electrophoretic study of the proteolytic enzymes from various lactococcus and lactobacillus strains.
AB  == cell extracts of various lactobacilli and two lactococcus strains were investigated for their immunoresponse with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against various proteolytic enzymes from lc. lactis. except for lactobacillus casei sbt 2233, none of the lactobacilli proteins showed immunoresponse with the monoclonal antibodies. with polyclonal antibodies raised  against aminopeptidases n and c and endopeptidase of lc. lactis an immunoresponse was observed. however, the molecular masses of the reactive bands on the blot were considerably different from those of the corresponding lactococcal peptidases, except for the band that reacted with polyclonal antibodies against aminopeptidase c. the polyclonal antibodies raised against x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and tripeptidase did not show any immunoreaction. as a control, all antibodies reacted with the lactococcal proteins on the blot, with molecular  masses corresponding to those reported for the proteinases and peptidases. the results clearly showed that most of the proteolytic enzymes of lactobacilli were  immunologically different from those of lactococci. the proteolytic enzymes in the cell-free extracts were separated by non-denaturing page and visualized by zymogram staining. the electrophoretic pattern of the proteolytic enzymes of lactobacilli was different from that of lc. lactis. both experiments indicate that the enzymes of the proteolytic system of lactobacilli are different from those of lactococci.

AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

TI  == conservation of a transcription antitermination mechanism in aminoacyl-trna synthetase and amino acid biosynthesis genes in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == most of the aminoacyl-trna synthetase genes identified to date in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus subtilis have been found to be regulated by readthrough of a transcriptional terminator located in the mrna leader region, upstream of the start of the coding sequence. all of these leader regions contain a series of conserved structural features, as well as a single codon displayed at a precise position within the structure, which has been shown for tyrs to be responsible for the specificity of the response to limitation for tyrosine. the structural features critical for transcription antitermination in bacillus aminoacyl-trna synthetase genes were found in the b. subtilis ilv-leu biosynthetic operon, the lactobacillus casei vals gene, the corynebacterium glutaminicum args gene, and three amino acid biosynthesis operons in lactobacillus casei and lactococcus lactis, suggesting that all of these genes are likely to be regulated by a similar antitermination mechanism. this regulatory system therefore appears to be widespread in gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase of staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus casei and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase b of escherichia coli build a  subfamily inside a greater enzyme family, named the glycosal hydrolase family 1,  which, in addition, contains nine beta-glycosidases of different origins. kinetic and immunological evidence is provided in this report which strengthens the relationship of the four 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases. it is shown that the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase b are able to split  aromatic beta-galactoside phosphates and beta-glucoside phosphates. the turnover  numbers of hydrolysis of substrates with different epimerization at c-4 of the glycon vary up to 15-fold only. two polyclonal antisera, one derived against the  native 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase from s. aureus and the other derived against  the 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase b, cross-reacted with both enzymes. peptides of the proteins were separated by reverse phase hplc. the cross-reacting peptides were sequenced and shown to be localized at almost the same position in the aligned primary structures of both enzymes. an insertion of nine amino acids near these antigenic domains is unique for the 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases and missing within the sequences of the beta-glycoside-specific members of the family. the lacg gene of a 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase negative s. aureus mutant was cloned  into e. coli and sequenced. in the totally inactive mutant protein only the glycine at position 332 was changed to an arginine. this amino acid is part of the sequence insertion near the antigenic domain reacting with both antisera.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of lacrabcdf and partial nucleotide sequence of lace from the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans are presented. comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of staphylococcus aureus and lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. the deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of lactobacillus casei. additionally, lacr has sequence homology with the repressor (deor) of the escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while lacc is similar to phosphokinases (fruk and pfkb) from e. coli. the primary translation products of the lacrabcdfe genes are  polypeptides of 251 (m(r) 28,713), 142 (m(r) 15,610), 171 (m(r) 18,950), 310 (m(r) 33,368), 325 (m(r) 36,495), 104 (m(r) 11,401), and 123 (nh2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. as inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (lacr), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (laca and lacb), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (lacc), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (lacd), and the sugar-specific components enzyme iii-lactose (lacf) and enzyme ii-lactose (lace) of the s. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system.  the nucleotide sequence encompassing the s. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of s. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.

TI  == nonidentity between plasmid and chromosomal copies of iss1-like sequences in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis cnrz270 and their possible role in chromosomal integration of plasmid genes.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of an insertion sequence (is) observed during mating experiments using the lactose-protease plasmid, pucl22, of lactococcus (lc.) lactis subsp. lactis cnrz270, was found to be similar to that of iss1 from lc. lactis subsp. lactis ml3. the is was named iss1rs. the chromosome of this strain  contains several copies of iss1-like is as assessed by hybridization. one of these copies was cloned and named iss1ch. its sequence differs from that of the plasmid-borne copy, and appears to be more closely related to iss1n from lc. lactis subsp. cremoris sk11. this suggests independent introduction of both iss1  elements. moreover, the observation of plasmid genes integrated in the cnrz270 chromosome near iss1ch suggests that their presence is the result of integration  by a campbell mechanism using both is homologies. iss1-like sequences were also found on plasmids of numerous lc. lactis strains, as well as one out of seven lactobacillus (lb.) casei and one out of three lb. plantarum strains examined.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the cell-envelope-associated proteinase from lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei ncdo 151.
AB  == the gene encoding the cell-envelope-associated proteinase of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei ncdo 151 (formerly lactobacillus casei ncdo 151) was cloned and sequenced. the gene was located on the chromosome and encoded a polypeptide of 1902 amino acids. the proteinase is n-terminally cleaved upon maturation. it shows extensive homology to the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris wg2 proteinase. similar to the situation in lactococcus, a maturation gene was found upstream of the proteinase gene. the cloned proteinase gene was expressed in lactobacillus plantarum. however, no expression was observed when the gene was cloned in lactococcus lactis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of is1165, an insertion sequence of leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == we have cloned and characterized an insertion sequence from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris strain db1165. this element, designated is1165, is  1553 bp, has imperfect inverted repeat ends, contains an open reading frame of 1236 bp, and is not related to any previously described insertion sequence. the copy number of is1165 varies from 4 to 13 in l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris strains allowing genetic fingerprinting of strains based on location and number of bands on hybridization. is1165 or closely related elements have been detected  by hybridization in l. lactis, l. oenos, pediococcus sp., lactobacillus helveticus, and lb. casei but not in lactococcus.

TI  == differences between lactobacillus casei subsp. casei 2206 and citrate-positive lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3022 in the characteristics of diacetyl production.
AB  == lactobacillus casei subsp. casei 2206 exhibited much lower levels of diacetyl reductase activity than citrlactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3022 but two-, three-, and more than eightfold-higher levels of diacetyl synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and nadh oxidase activities, respectively. a requirement for metal ions by the diacetyl synthases in both species was observed. the extracts of strain 2206 but not strain 3022 produced more diacetyl from pyruvate when the reaction for diacetyl synthase was aerated than when it was conducted statically.

TI  == characterization of the cell wall-bound proteinase of lactobacillus casei hn14.
AB  == lactobacillus casei hn14, which was isolated from homemade cheese, produces an extracellular, cell wall-bound proteinase. the hn14 proteinase can be removed from the cell envelope by washing the cells in a ca-free buffer. the activity of  the crude proteinase extract is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, showing that the enzyme is a serine-type proteinase. considering the substrate specificity, the hn14 proteinase is similar to the lactococcal pi-type enzyme, since it hydrolyzes beta-casein only. lactobacillus casei hn14 appeared to be plasmid free, which suggests that the proteinase gene is chromosomally located. chromosomal dna of this strain hybridizes with dna probes q1 (which contains a fragment of the prtm gene) and q6 and q92 (which contain fragments of the prtp gene); all three probes originated from the proteinase gene region of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. a restriction enzyme map of the proteinase region of  lactobacillus casei hn14 was constructed on the basis of hybridization experiments. comparison of the restriction enzyme maps of the lactobacillus casei hn14 proteinase gene region and those of lactococcal proteinase gene regions studied so far indicates that they are highly similar.

TI  == molecular cloning and dna sequence of lace, the gene encoding the lactose-specific enzyme ii of the phosphotransferase system of lactobacillus casei. evidence that a cysteine residue is essential for sugar phosphorylation.
AB  == the gene coding for the lactose-specific enzyme ii of the lactobacillus casei phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, lace, has been isolated  by molecular cloning and expressed in escherichia coli. the dna sequence of the lace gene and the deduced amino acid sequence are presented. the putative translation product comprises a hydrophobic protein of 577 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 62,350 da. the deduced polypeptide has a high degree of sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose-specific enzymes ii of staphylococcus aureus and lactococcus lactis. the sequence surrounding cysteine 483 was strongly conserved in the three proteins. the identity of the lace product as the enzyme iilacl.casei was demonstrated by in vitro lactose phosphorylation assays using the protein expressed in e. coli. single replacement of each of the histidine and cysteine residues by site-directed mutagenesis pointed to cysteine 483 as an amino acid residue essential for the phosphoryl group transfer reaction.

TI  == characterization of the lactose-specific enzymes of the phosphotransferase system in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the plasmid-encoded lactose genes of the lactococcus lactis phosphotransferase system encoding enzyme iiilac (lacf) and enzyme iilac (lace) have been identified and cloned in escherichia coli and l. lactis. nucleotide sequence and transcription analysis showed that these genes are organized into a lactose-inducible operon with the gene order lacf-lace-lacg-lacx, the latter two  genes encoding phospho-beta-galactosidase and a 34-kda protein with an unknown function, respectively. the lac-operon is immediately followed by an is element that is homologous to iss1. enzyme iiilac was purified from l. lactis and determination of its nh2-terminal sequence demonstrated that the lacf gene starts with a ttg codon and encodes a 105 amino acid protein (mr = 11416). cross-linking studies with the purified enzyme showed that enzyme iiilac is active as a trimer. a mutant lacf gene was identified in strain yp2-5 and appeared to encode enzyme iiilac containing the missense mutation g18e. the lacf gene could be expressed under control of vector-located promoter sequences resulting in overproduction of enzyme iiilac in e. coli and complementation of the l. lactis lacf mutant yp2-5.  the deduced amino acid sequence of enzyme iilac consists of 586 amino acids (mr = 61562) and shows the characteristics of a hydrophobic, integral membrane protein. the deduced primary structures of the l. lactis enzyme iiilac and enzyme iilac are homologous to those of staphylococcus aureus (72 and 71% identity, respectively) and lactobacillus casei (48 and 47% identity, respectively). in contrast, the organization of the lactose genes differs significantly between those gram-positive bacteria. heterogramic homology in specific domains was observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the lactose-specific enzymes and that of e. coli enzyme iiicel and enzyme iicel, which suggest a common function in the transport and phosphorylation of these structurally related beta-glucosides.

TI  == influence of aflatoxin b1 on gas production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the main characteristic of homofermentative lactic acid bacteria is that they do  not produce gas from glucose and other sugars. however, in these experiments lactobacillus casei, lb. plantarum and streptococcus lactis in broth media with glucose, galactose, lactose and sucrose, and aflatoxin b1 produces acid and also  a significant amount of gas. in the control media without aflatoxin, these bacteria did not produce gas. the data suggest that lactic acid bacteria, known until now as homofermentative, become heterofermentative because of the influence of aflatoxin b1. the results of these investigations are of practical value because they may explain the defect of cheese "blowing," which can appear in trapist cheese vacuum packed in foil. this type of unusual "blowing" occurs approximately one month after cheese manufacture. this defect can be characterized by very large holes and cracks inside the cheese. the flavor is similar to that of young cheese, which can be very undesirable for a ripened, trapist, aged cheese.

TI  == characterization of a pam beta 1 deletion derivative isolated from lactobacillus  casei after conjugation.
AB  == streptococcal plasmid pam beta 1 was conjugally transferred from streptococcus lactis kb953 (a transformant of pam beta 1) into lactobacillus casei 239. a unique transconjugant, l. casei c2, was found to contain a small (11.1 kilobase pair) plasmid, ply201, which was derived by a deletion event from pam beta 1. restriction analysis revealed that ply201 was missing approximately 58% of the original pam beta 1 genome, and contained 5 single restriction sites for avai, ecori, pvuii, hpai and kpni. physical analyses revealed that the stability and copy number of ply201 were elevated compared with those of pam beta 1 in l. casei. in addition, ply201 was no longer transferable by conjugation.

TI  == in vivo gene transfer systems and transposons.
AB  == the continued development of our understanding and application of the in vivo gene transfer systems, transduction and conjugation, and the more recent use of transposons in lactic acid bacteria is reviewed. the discovery of transduction and its use as a tool for genetic analysis is described. the history of the use of conjugation in lactic acid bacteria is outlined, but more detailed discussion  is reserved for in-depth analysis of the conjugation system associated with the lactose plasmids of streptococcus lactis strains ml3 and c2. this system is notable for an unusual cell aggregation phenotype associated with variants of lactose plasmids capable of high frequency transfer and the complex dna interactions associated with this property. recent advances in the use of wide host range conjugation systems, such as that of plasmid pam beta 1 are described, including the mobilisation of vectors by cointegrate formation and subsequent segregation after transfer. the successful exploitation of conjugation for the construction of bacteriophage-resistant starter cultures is highlighted. a description of transposable genetic elements in the lactic acid bacteria, both insertion sequences and transposons, puts emphasis on the elegant analysis of insertion sequence isl1 in lactobacillus casei and on the exploitation of the conjugative transposons tn916 and tn919. the latter is especially important for providing a technology to initiate analysis of the bacterial chromosome of the lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria in skim milk with special reference  to the biodegradation of casein fractions.
AB  == streptococci and lactobacilli were assayed for their proteolytic activity in pasteurised (95 degrees c for 30 min) fresh friesian cows' skim milk incubated at 30 degrees c for 48 h. lactobacilli were more proteolytic than the streptococci except s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens. s. faecalis and s. thermophilus followed  s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis in the proteolytic activity. electrophoretic analysis of the precipitated casein revealed k-, pre-beta- and the small slow band of alpha s1-casein to be the most fractions and beta-casein the least fraction susceptible to the biodegradation. s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens was the only organism able to degrade beta-casein to 3 fractions within 48 h. s. lactis with its subsp. diacetylactis was characterized by its inability to degrade gamma-casein. addition of 2.0 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 2.0 mmol mg2+, 0.5 mmol mn2+ and 0.1 mmol fe2+/l of skim milk culture of each l. casei and l. plantarum increased acid formation but decreased proteolysis. 6% nacl was inhibitory to both. after 60 days at 18 degrees c, a fraction, probably derived from beta-casein, was noticeable. the large intense band of alpha s1-casein appears to be degraded gradually to only small peptides which in turn are transferred immediately into the cells. the hydrolysis of gamma-casein and beta-casein also appears to be inhibited by exogenously supplied nacl and nutrients, respectively.

TI  == stimulation of lactic acid bacteria by a micrococcus isolate: evidence for multiple effects.
AB  == growth of, and rate of acid production by, six cultures of lactic acid bacteria were increased in the presence of micrococcus isolate f4 or a preparation of its  capsular material. concentrations of hydrogen peroxide found in pure cultures of  the lactic acid bacteria were not detectable, or were greatly reduced, in mixed culture with micrococcus isolate f4. the capsular material was not as effective as whole cells in preventing accumulation of h(2)o(2). catalase stimulated growth of, and the rate of acid production by, the lactic acid bacteria, but not to the  same extent as micrococcus isolate f4 in some cultures. the existence of two mechanisms for micrococcal stimulation of the lactic acid bacteria is postulated. one mechanism involves removal of h(2)o(2); the other has not been characterized.
