TI  == bifidobacterial lipoglycan as a new cause for false-positive platelia aspergillus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity.
AB  == we previously hypothesized that a lipoglycan of bifidobacterium bifidum subsp. pennsylvanicum cross-reacts with the platelia aspergillus (pa) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) based on the presence of galactofuranosyl epitopes in the cell wall (m. a. s. h. mennink-kersten, r. r. klont, a. warris, h. j. m. op den camp, and p. e. verweij, lancet 363:325-327, 2004). we tested this hypothesis by testing bacterial suspensions of different bifidobacterial species and other gram-positive and -negative bacteria with the pa elisa, which is used to detect circulating galactomannan for the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. furthermore, neonatal fecal samples were enumerated for bifidobacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and tested for pa elisa reactivity. all bifidobacteria, except b. infantis and b. adolescentis, showed reactivity 6- to 600-fold higher compared to the controls (i.e., micrococcus luteus and propionibacterium freudenreichii, which contain a cell wall lipomannan). eggerthella lenta showed a 25-fold-higher reactivity. elisa reactivity was clearly shown to be associated with bacterial lipoglycans containing a beta-1,5-galactofuranosyl chain. all neonatal feces showed pa elisa reactivity and associated numbers of bifidobacteria. since high concentrations of bifidobacteria are present in the human gut, these bacteria or excreted lipoglycan may cause false serum pa elisa reactivity in selected patient groups,  especially neonates.

TI  == production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of bifidobacterium longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. at the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic  and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. in a single cultivation of bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. to increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of b. longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by b. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by p. freudenreichii, was done using tpy medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. by the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. the antimicrobial  activities of the mixture against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus were  35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of b. longum alone. when the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of b. longum and p. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using tpy medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for m. luteus, pseudomonas sp. and s. aureus, respectively.
