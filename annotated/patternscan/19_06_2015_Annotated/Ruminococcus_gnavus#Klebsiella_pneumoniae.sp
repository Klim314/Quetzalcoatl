TI  == target highlights in casp9: experimental target structures for the critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction.
AB  == one goal of the casp community wide experiment on the critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction is to identify the current state of the art in protein structure prediction and modeling. a fundamental principle of  casp is blind prediction on a set of relevant protein targets, that is, the participating computational methods are tested on a common set of experimental target proteins, for which the experimental structures are not known at the time  of modeling. therefore, the casp experiment would not have been possible without  broad support of the experimental protein structural biology community. in this article, several experimental groups discuss the structures of the proteins which they provided as prediction targets for casp9, highlighting structural and functional peculiarities of these structures: the long tail fiber protein gp37 from bacteriophage t4, the cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase ibeta dimerization/docking domain, the ectodomain of the jtb (jumping translocation breakpoint) transmembrane receptor, autotaxin in complex with an inhibitor, the dna-binding j-binding protein 1 domain essential for biosynthesis and maintenance of dna base-j (beta-d-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil) in trypanosoma and leishmania, an so far uncharacterized 73 residue domain from ruminococcus gnavus  with a fold typical for pdz-like domains, a domain from the phycobilisome core-membrane linker phycobiliprotein apce from synechocystis, the heat shock protein 90 activators pfc0360w and pfc0270w from plasmodium falciparum, and 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase from klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == clostridium difficile colonization in early infancy is accompanied by changes in  intestinal microbiota composition.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major enteric pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. host susceptibility to c. difficile infections results partly from inability of the intestinal microbiota to resist c. difficile colonization. during early infancy, asymptomatic colonization by c. difficile is  common and the intestinal microbiota shows low complexity. thus, we investigated  the potential relationship between the microbiota composition and the implantation of c. difficile in infant gut. fecal samples from 53 infants, ages 0 to 13 months, 27 negative and 26 positive for c. difficile, were studied. dominant microbiota profiles were assessed by pcr-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). bacterial signatures of the intestinal microbiota associated with colonization by c. difficile were deciphered using principal component analysis (pca). resulting bands of interest in ttge profiles were excised, sequenced, and analyzed by nucleotide blast (ncbi). while global biodiversity was not affected, interclass pca on instrumental variables highlighted significant differences in dominant bacterial species between c. difficile-colonized and noncolonized infants (p = 0.017). four bands were specifically associated with the presence or absence of c. difficile: 16s rrna gene sequences related to ruminococcus gnavus and klebsiella pneumoniae for colonized infants and to bifidobacterium longum for noncolonized infants. we demonstrated that the presence of c. difficile in the intestinal microbiota of infants was associated with changes in this ecosystem's composition. these results suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota might be crucial in the colonization process, although the chronology of events remains to be determined.
