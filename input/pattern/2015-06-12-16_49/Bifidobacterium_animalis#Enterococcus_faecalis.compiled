TI  - Biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - To investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive LAB and bifidobacteria (BF) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. Based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus. The LAB and BF isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on SDS-PAGE protein profile analysis of whole cells. Furthermore, partial 16S rDNA sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. The identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus (78.8%), seven species to the genus Bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus Enterococcus (11.6%), one species of Streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of Pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). In particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were L. reuteri, L. animalis, and L. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. Besides these, Enterococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. The sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the DDBJ and the similarity was above 97.2%. Their partial 16S rRNA genes were registered in the DDBJ.
TI  - Relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. animalis and Enterococcus faecalis. We also determined the number of immunoglobulin (Ig)A+, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha+, interleukin (IL)-6+ and IL-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to BALB/c mice. All strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. No correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. When some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation to liver was observed. The oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1)) and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. The differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. However, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. The ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of IL-6 by IL-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on Salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  - A defined bacterial culture protective against Salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (CF) culture apparatus. Chicks receiving the CF culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by S. typhimurium. The culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus avium, two strains of Enterococcus faecalis (designated A and B), Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus animalis, a Lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain CMS), Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, E. fergusonii, Bifidobacterium animals, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici. Results indicated that CF cultures can be used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to S. typhimurium in the chick cecum.
