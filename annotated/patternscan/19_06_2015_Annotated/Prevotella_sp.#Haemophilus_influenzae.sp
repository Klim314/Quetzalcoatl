TI  == differential activation of eosinophils by bacteria associated with asthma.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that there is a complex interaction between microbiota and various human diseases. some bacteria have been reported to be involved in the inception and progression of asthma, and others in the protection against asthma. we know very little about the mechanisms by which bacteria do harm or good with regard to asthma. this study investigated whether bacteria exert differential effects on the functions of eosinophils, major effector cells  in airway inflammation in asthma. methods: eosinophils were purified from healthy adult volunteers by percoll density gradient centrifugation and negative immunomagnetic bead selection using anti-cd16 microbeads. three kinds of heat-killed bacteria that have been implicated in asthma, namely staphylococcus aureus (sa), haemophilus influenzae (hi) and a prevotella sp. (ps), were tested for their effects on the secretion of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (edn), the generation of superoxides and the production of cytokines/chemokines. results: sa, but not hi or ps, induced significant edn release in a dose-dependent manner. superoxide generation was significantly enhanced by each of the bacterial species, but most strongly by sa, which induced significantly greater tnf-alpha production by eosinophils than either hi or ps. conversely, interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was more strongly induced by hi and ps than by sa. conclusions: bacteria exert differential effects on eosinophils. based on these results, sa may be involved in the exacerbation of, and hi and ps in the inhibition of, eosinophilic inflammation in asthma.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == bacteriology of adenoids and tonsils in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.
AB  == adenoids and tonsils electively removed from 25 children with a history of recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) adenotonsillitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. two hundred twenty-four organisms (112 aerobes and facultatives, 110 anaerobes, and 2 candida albicans) were isolated from the tonsils, and 229 (111 aerobes and facultatives and 118 anaerobes) were isolated from the adenoids. mixed infection was present in all instances, with an average of 9.1 isolates per specimen. the predominant aerobes  were streptococcus sp, haemophilus influenzae, and gabhs, and the prevalent anaerobes were peptostreptococcus, prevotella, and fusobacterium spp. beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 72 isolates recovered from 22  tonsils (88%) and in 74 isolates recovered from 21 adenoids (84%). discrepancies  in the organisms recovered were found between the tonsils and adenoids. of the aerobic isolates, 20% were isolated only in tonsils and 18% only in adenoids. of  the anaerobes, 20% were found only in tonsils and 26% only in adenoids. this study demonstrates a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in both adenoids and tonsils, and discrepancies in recovery of pathogens such as gabhs. the adenoids may serve as a potential source of tonsillitis caused by gabhs.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == microbiology of serous otitis media in children: correlation with age and length  of effusion.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to correlate the microbiology of serous otitis media in children with the duration of the condition and the patient's age. aspirates of serous ear fluids from 114 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was noted in 47 patients (41%). aerobic organisms only were recovered in 27 aspirates (57% of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria only in 7 (15%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 13 (28%). a total of 83 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.2 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). there were a total  of 57 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus sp (12). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (10), prevotella spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (4). the rate of positive cultures (20 of 36; 56%) was higher in patients younger than 2 years of age than in those older than 2 years of age (27 of 78; 35%). streptococcus pneumoniae and h influenzae were more often isolated in children younger than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 3 to 5 months, whereas anaerobes were recovered more often in those older than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 6 to 13 months. these data illustrate the effects of the length of effusion and age on the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in serous otitis media.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bacterial tracheitis in children.
AB  == study objectives: establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bacterial tracheitis in children. method: retrospective review of specimens obtained from 14 children with bacterial tracheitis that were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: a total 30 bacterial isolates were recovered, 17 aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 13 anaerobic. aerobic bacteria only were present in six (43%) specimens, anaerobes only in three (21%), and mixed aerobic  and anaerobic flora in five (36%). polymicrobial flora was recovered in 10 of the 14 specimens. the predominant organisms were staphylococcus aureus (5 isolates),  haemophilus influenzae type b (4), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas (4), fusobacterium sp. (2), and moraxella catarrhalis (2). two organisms that were also isolated from the tracheal aspirates were recovered from the blood of two patients (one each of h. influenzae and prevotella intermedia). eleven beta-lactamase-producing organisms  were isolated from nine patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus and m. catarrhalis, and two each of h. influenzae and prevotella sp. conclusions: these  data confirm the predominance of s. aureus and h. influenzae in causing bacterial tracheitis in children and suggest a potential role for anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == microbiology and management of sinusitis.
AB  == purpose: the pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis are reviewed. materials and methods: the current literature is reviewed. review: sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. bacterial pathogens contribute to the inflammatory process-streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis are predominant in acute sinusitis, while anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in the immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters. many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. aureus, fusobacterium sp., and prevotella sp.) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (s. pneumoniae). the pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to  cause infections, and indirectly through the production of beta-lactamase. conclusions: the indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by "shielding" penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. the direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections. proper therapy, with antimicrobial and decongestants combined when indicated with surgical drainage and correction of pathology, constitutes the cornerstone of management of sinusitis.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == expression of capsules by haemophilus influenzae in mixed infections.
AB  == the pathogenicity of eight clinical isolates of non-type b haemophilus influenzae was investigated by inoculating them subcutaneously into mice, alone or mixed with viable or non-viable bacteria of certain other species. three of the h. influenzae isolates were non-capsulated while five were slightly capsulated (less than 1% of organisms had capsules). the other strains of bacteria tested were four isolates of capsulated and four isolates of non-capsulated pigmented strains of prevotella sp. and porphyromonus sp. as well as a capsulate klebsiella pneumoniae ("helpers"). none of the non-capsulated strains induced an abscess when inoculated alone. following co-inoculation of viable or non-viable "helpers" with h. influenzae, abscesses were formed in all instances in which the "helper"  had a capsule. profusely capsulated cells of h. influenzae were recovered, however, only from abscesses induced with the five slightly capsulated strains of h. influenzae. these capsulated organisms were found serologically to be of type  b and induced abscesses when inoculated alone. our findings illustrate the ability of non-capsulated strains of h. influenzae to produce progeny of capsulated type b organisms after co-inoculation with certain other species.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
