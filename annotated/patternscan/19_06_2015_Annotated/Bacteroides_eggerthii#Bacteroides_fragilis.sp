TI  == prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool samples in north lebanon.
AB  == fifty one strains of the bacteroides fragilis group were isolated from 45 fecal samples. classical phenotypic identification showed that 16 isolates were b. thetaiotaomicron, 12 b. uniformis, 9 b. eggerthii, 7 b. vulgatus, 3 b. caccae, 2  parabacteroides distasonis with 1 identified b. ovatus and 1 b. fragilis. the 51  strains were tested for susceptibility against 16 antimicrobial agents and the mics for metronidazole were determined. the tests showed that imipenem, meropenem and chloramphenicol were the most effective antibiotics (98%, 98% and 92.16% of susceptibility, respectively) followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, rifampin (88.24% susceptibility), moxifloxacin 86.27% and tigecycline 84.31%. ofloxacin and cefotaxime were the least effective antibiotics with 27.45% and 0% of activity respectively. only six of the 51 isolated strains were resistant to metronidazole with mics = 64 mg/l (1 strain) and > 256 mg/l (5 strains).

TI  == major phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in the human gut can arise from microbial fermentation of protein.
AB  == scope: plant secondary metabolites, such as phenolic acids are commonly associated with benefits for human health. two of the most abundant phenylpropanoid-derived compounds detected in human faecal samples are phenylacetic acid (paa) and 4-hydroxylphenylacetic acid (4-hydroxypaa). although  they have the potential to be derived from diets rich in plant-based foods, evidence suggests that these compounds can be derived from the microbial fermentation of aromatic amino acids (aaas) in the colon. methods and results: to identify the bacteria responsible, 26 strains representing 25 of the dominant human colonic species were screened for phenyl metabolite formation. seven strains produced significant amounts of both paa and 4-hydroxypaa. these included five out of seven bacteroidetes (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides eggerthii, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides fragilis, parabacteroides distasonis), and two out of 17 firmicutes (eubacterium hallii and clostridium bartlettii). these species also produced indole-3-acetic acid (iaa), the corresponding tryptophan metabolite, but c. bartlettii showed 100 times higher iaa production than the other six strains. four strains were further tested and paa formation was substantially increased by phenylalanine, 4-hydroxypaa by tyrosine and iaa by tryptophan. conclusion: this study demonstrates that certain microbial species have the ability to ferment all three aaas and that protein fermentation is the likely source of major phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in the colon.

TI  == application of quantitative real-time pcr for rapid identification of bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  == our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) method to detect bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. compared to conventional anaerobic culture, qrt-pcr can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of b. fragilis group and similar species. b. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. however, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. we designed specific primers and probes based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of bacteroides caccae, bacteroides eggerthii, b. fragilis, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, odoribacter splanchnicus (bacteroides splanchnicus), parabacteroides distasonis (bacteroides distasonis) and parabacteroides merdae (bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of qrt-pcr in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. the target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by qrt-pcr (p-value < 0.001). b. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to qrt-pcr while culture showed it to be b. fragilis (16 positive samples). additionally, for each species qrt-pcr detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting dna of dead organisms by qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of b. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.

TI  == lessons learned from the anaerobe survey: historical perspective and review of the most recent data (2005-2007).
AB  == background: the rationale and lessons learned through the evolution of the national survey for the susceptibility of bacteroides fragilis group from its initiation in 1981 through 2007 are reviewed here. the survey was conceived in 1980 to track emerging antimicrobial resistance in bacteroides species. methods:  data from the last 11 years of the survey (1997-2007), including 6574 isolates from 13 medical centers, were analyzed for in vitro antimicrobial resistance to both frequently used and newly developed anti-anaerobic agents. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics were determined using agar dilution  in accordance with clinical and laboratory standards institute recommendations. results: the analyses revealed that the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active agents against these pathogens, with resistance rates of 0.9%-2.3%. in the most recent 3 years of the survey (2005-2007), resistance to some agents was shown to depend on the species, such as ampicillin-sulbactam against bacteroides distasonis (20.6%)  and tigecycline against bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides eggerthii ( approximately 7%). very high resistance rates (>50%) were noted for moxifloxacin  and trovafloxacin, particularly against bacteroides vulgatus. during that period  of study, non-b. fragilis bacteroides species had >40% resistance to clindamycin. metronidazole-resistant bacteroides strains were also first reported during that  period. conclusions: in summary, resistance to antibiotics was greater among non-b. fragilis bacteroides species than among b. fragilis and was especially greater among species with a low frequency of isolation, such as bacteroides caccae and b. uniformis. the emergence of resistance among the non-b. fragilis bacteroides species underscores the need for speciation of b. fragilis group isolates and for clinicians to be aware of associations between species and drug  resistance.

TI  == relative abundance of bacteroides spp. in stools and wastewaters as determined by hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension.
AB  == a molecular method, termed hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope),  was used to determine the relative abundances of predominant bacteroides spp. present in fecal microbiota and wastewaters. for this analysis, genomic dna in feces of healthy human adults, bovines, and swine and in wastewaters was extracted and total bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and used as the dna templates for hope. nineteen oligonucleotide primers were designed to detect  14 bacteroides spp. at different hierarchical levels (domain, order, cluster, and species) and were arranged into and used in six multiplex hope reaction mixtures. results showed that species like b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. caccae, b.  uniformis, b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, and b. massiliensis could be individually detected in human feces at abundances corresponding to as little as 0.1% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes. minor species like b. pyogenes, b. salyersiae, and  b. nordii were detected only collectively using a primer that targeted the b. fragilis subgroup (corresponding to approximately 0.2% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna  genes). furthermore, bac303-related targets (i.e., most bacteroidales) were observed to account for 28 to 44% of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes from human fecal microbiota, and their abundances were higher than those detected in the bovine and swine fecal microbiota and in wastewaters by factors of five and two,  respectively. these results were comparable to those obtained by quantitative pcr and to those reported previously from studies using whole-cell fluorescence hybridization and 16s rrna clone library methods, supporting the conclusion that  hope can be a sensitive, specific, and rapid method to determine the relative abundances of bacteroides spp. predominant in fecal samples.

TI  == [bacteroides fragilis group in non-diarrheal human feces and its antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == bacteroides is a predominant anaerobic bacteria of the human colon. since the ten species of the bacteroides fragilis group are responsible for most anaerobic endogenous infections, the antimicrobial resistance of these bacteria is of great concern due to the role they can play in the dissemination of resistance. eighty  non-diarrheic human feces samples were analyzed. each sample was inoculated in bbe (bacteroides bile esculin) and kvlb (kanamycin, vancomycin, laked blood) agar plates and were incubated in anaerobic conditions for 48 h at 35 degrees c. for identification and antimicrobial sensitivity, miniaturized systems for anaerobic  bacteria (rapid id-32a and atb ana, biomerieux) were used. sixty-four (80%) of the samples were positive for at least one bacteroides fragilis species; b. uniformis and b. fragilis were the most frequent species (24.6% and 16.9%); b. stercoris and b. eggerthii were the least frequent (0.7 and 2.1%). the strains showed resistance to different penicillins (40.2-93.1%), some even in the presence of beta-lactamase inhibitors, to cephalosporins (31.0-52.1%) and to frequently used antibiotics against anaerobes, such as clindamycin (32.2%) and imipenem (10.3%). the most effective antimicrobials against bacteroides fragilis  were piperacillin and ticarcillin combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors, as well as chloramphenicol and metronidazole (>90% susceptibility). none of the b. fragilis group were resistant to clindamycin or metronidazole, but one-third of the imipenem-resistant strains belonged to this species. the most resistant species was b. distasonis, while b. vulgatus was the most susceptible. none of the tested antimicrobials were effective against all ten species; the majority of the species had some isolates that were resistant to imipenem, metronidazole or clindamycin. this resistance pattern suggests the presence of efficient transmission mechanisms among these endogenous bacteria.

TI  == [esbl-positive strains of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from patients at the regional hospital center in plock (poland)].
AB  == the aim of this study was to confirm a presumptive qualification of clinical b. fragilis group strains isolated in plock as esbl-positive strains and to determine some properties of these strains. twenty four clinical strains belonging to the b. fragilis group, isolated first of all from surgical patients, were received for testing. identification of strains was performed in the automatic atb expression system (biomerieux sa, france) using biochemical api 20  a strips. strains were tested for the production of catalase (id color catalase test, biomerieux sa) and beta-lactamase (cefinase, bbl, becton dickinson, usa). susceptibility of strains to four antimicrobial agents: clindamycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and imipenem was determined by etest (ab biodisk, sweden). esbls were detected with the use of two disc diffusion methods: the double-disc synergy test (ddst) according to jarlier et al. and the  diagnostic disc (dd) test according to appleton. seventeen of examined strains belonged to the species bacteroides fragilis, three--to b. ovatus/thetaiotaomicron, two--to b. distasonis, one--to b. uniformis and one--to  b. stercoris/eggerthii. one strain (b. uniformis) did not produce catalase, whereas all strains produced beta-lactamases. examined strains were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and imipenem. one clindamycin-resistant strain was detected (b. fragilis). occurrence of esbl-type  enzymes was confirmed in 22 strains of following species: b. fragilis (17 strains), b. ovatus/thetaiotaomicron (3), b. distasonis (1) and b. uniformis (1). clinical strains of the b. fragilis group with a new mechanism of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics appeared during last years in poland. they produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), so they are resistant to penicillins,  cephalosporins and monobactams. monitoring of infections caused by these threatening strains in hospital patients is very important.

TI  == rapid identification of the species of the bacteroides fragilis group by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers.
AB  == we report a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to identify the 10 bacteroides fragilis group species - bacteroides caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b.  thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus. these 10 species were first divided into three subgroups by multiplex pcr-g, followed by three multiplex pcr  assays with three species-specific primer mixtures for identification to the species level. the primers were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna, the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and part of the 23s rrna gene. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 155 clinical isolates of the b. fragilis group that were previously identified to the species level by phenotypic tests. the new scheme was more accurate than phenotypic identification, which was accurate only 84.5% of the time. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of the b. fragilis group species. this will permit more accurate assessment of the role of various b. fragilis group members in infections and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

TI  == high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == this prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. one to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the prevotella genus (bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). pcr assays were used to detect cfxa and cepa/cbla, the genes encoding class a/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the bacteroides fragilis group. the present investigation confirmed  the role of prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. additionally, this pcr screening showed (1): the high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepa/cbla (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxa in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.

TI  == genetic variation in 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer regions and the possible use of this genetic variation for molecular diagnosis of bacteroides species.
AB  == the structural variation in 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer regions (its) among bacteroides species was assessed by pcr amplification and sequencing  analysis, and its possible use for molecular diagnosis of these species was evaluated. ninety strains of the genus bacteroides, including the species b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis and b. vulgatus, produced one to three its amplification products with  sizes ranging from 615 to 810 bp. some bacteroides strains could be differentiated at species level on the basis of its amplification patterns and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis using a four-nucleotide-recognizing enzyme, msp i. the results of sequence analysis of its amplification products revealed genes for ile-trna and ala-trna in all strains tested. the nucleotide sequence, except for that in trna-coding regions,  was highly variable and characteristic for each species, but a common sequence among b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. ovatus was observed. a digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probe (named fot1), which was designed from this conserved sequence, specifically hybridized to the its amplification products from b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. ovatus. these results suggest that the its region is a useful target for the development of rapid and accurate techniques for identification of bacteroides species.

TI  == genome analysis of bacteroides by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis: chromosome sizes and restriction patterns.
AB  == the chromosomal dnas of nine strains of seven bacteroides species including b. fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides, were digested with rare-cutting restriction enzymes i-ceu i, not i, and asc i and analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the genome sizes of b. fragilis, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus were  determined to be 5.3, 4.8, 4.4, 6.9, 4.8, 4.6, and 5.1 mbp, respectively. b. distasonis and b. vulgatus, and also b. uniformis and b. eggerthii, showed similar i-ceu i restriction profiles. i-ceu i cut b. uniformis and b. eggerthii genomes into four, b. ovatus into five, b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron into  six, and b. distasonis and b. vulgatus into seven fragments. on the basis of genome size, restriction profile, and i-ceu i fragment number, a phylogenetic tree of the bacteroides species was proposed. this was in overall agreement with  the previous phylogenetic tree obtained by 16s rrna data, with the exceptions of  b. distasonis and b. ovatus.

TI  == intestinal anaerobic bacteria hydrolyse sorivudine, producing the high blood concentration of 5-(e)-(2-bromovinyl)uracil that increases the level and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil.
AB  == sorivudine, 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-(e)-(2-bromovinyl)uracil, is a potent antiviral agent against varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus type 1. however, sorivudine should not be used in combination with anticancer drugs such  as 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) because (e)-5-(2-bromovinyl)uracil (bvu), a metabolite of sorivudine, inhibits the degradation of 5-fu, resulting in its accumulation in the blood and marked enhancement of the toxicity of 5-fu. since phosphorolytic enzymes generate bvu from sorivudine, we investigated the distribution of the enzyme activity in rats. high activity was found in the cecal and large intestinal contents, while very low or no detectable activity in the liver, kidney, stomach, cecum, large intestine, and the stomach and small intestinal contents. these results suggest that intestinal microflora play an important role in bvu production. therefore, we measured the phosphorylase activity in cell-free extracts from 23 aerobes, 16 anaerobes and a fungus. bacteroides species b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. fragilis, b. uniformis and b. eggerthii, dominant members of intestinal microflora, had high activity to convert sorivudine to bvu. to elucidate the contribution of intestinal microflora to bvu  production in vivo, we administered sorivudine to rats treated with several antibiotics and measured the bvu concentration in the serum of rats. when sorivudine was given to rats treated with ampicillin or a mixture of bacitracin,  neomycin and streptomycin, which decreased the numbers of viable aerobes and anaerobes, only a small amount of bvu was found in the serum. bvu concentration in the serum of rats treated with metronidazole to decrease the number of intestinal anaerobes was also very low. in contrast, bvu concentration in the serum of rats treated with kanamycin, which was used to decrease the number of aerobes selectively, was higher than that of non-treated rats. these results also suggest that bvu is produced by intestinal anaerobic bacteria especially bacteroides species in vivo.

TI  == sphingolipid composition in bacteroides species.
AB  == sphingolipid profiles of strains from species of genus bacteroides, and representative strains from prevotella and porphyromonas, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectrophotometry. two major types of phosphosphingolipid, ceramide phosphorylethanolamine and ceramide phosphorylglycerol, were detected in b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, b. caccae, b. eggerthii, b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. stercoris, but not in b. merdae, b. distasonis, and b. vulgatus. strains from the genera prevotella and porphyromonas also contained these two sphingolipids. these sphingolipid profiles were conserved within the species tested, and may be useful for differentiation and recognition of relationships within the genera bacteroides, prevotella and porphyromonas.

TI  == purification and characterization of a fibrinogen-degrading protease in bacteroides fragilis strain ych46.
AB  == a novel fibrinogenolytic protease was purified from bacteroides fragilis strain ych46. the protease was extracted from cells by ultrasonic treatment and was purified 425-fold with a recovery of 2.1% by sequential procedures using azocasein as a substrate. the purified protease showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an estimated molecular weight of 100 kda, which was consistent with the value obtained by gel filtration, indicating a monomeric native structure. its optimal ph, km, and vmax for azocasein were 7.5, 0.2%, and 286 u/min/mg, respectively. the protease activity was completely inhibited by addition of 1 mm hg2+, cu2+, zn2+, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, n-ethylmaleimide or p-chloromercuribenzoate but not  by the inhibitors of metalloprotease or aspartic protease, suggesting that the enzyme is a serine-thiol-like protease. the protease hydrolyzed azocasein, casein, fibrinogen, gelatin, and azocoll, but not bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, fibrin, fibronectin, immunoglobulins, transferrin, hemoglobin or types i, iii, and iv collagen. the enzyme also hydrolyzed the chromogenic substrates alanyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, l-valyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, alanyl-alanyl-valyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, and glycyl-proline p-nitroanilide, but was inert toward l-alanine p-nitroanilide, alanyl-alanyl-alanine p-nitroanilide, and n-alpha-benzoyl-dl-arginine p-nitroanilide. the protease completely hydrolyzed the alpha-chain of fibrinogen at 37 c within 10 hr and at the same time the time required for clotting of protease-treated fibrinogen by thrombin was prolonged. the fibrinogenolytic activity of a crude extract of b. fragilis was stronger than that of other species of the bacteroides fragilis group tested: b. ovatus, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. uniformis, and b. thetaiotaomicron. these results suggest that the fibrinogenolytic protease is an  important biological factor in bacteroides infection.

TI  == electrophoretic analysis of the lipopolysaccharides of bacteroides spp.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) extracts of reference strains and isolates of bacteroides spp. prepared by the proteinase k method were resolved by tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and located by silver staining. a considerable diversity of lps profiles was evident within the  bacteroides genus although profiles were essentially species-specific, with some  minor interstrain variations apparent among isolates of b. uniformis, b. ovatus,  b. eggerthii and b. thetaiotaomicron. the lps of most species consisted of a major rough lps component of 2-5 kda and a series of higher molecular weight bands which varied with species. b. vulgatus lps was distinctive in showing an extensive ladder of multiple repeating oligosaccharide units with molecular weights ranging from 4 to > 17 kda b. stercoris lps included a high molecular weight (> 17 kda) ladder of repeating oligosaccharide units. b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron differed from most other species in producing a short ladder of  repeating oligosaccharide units interspersing the rough lps and a 5.6 kda (b. fragilis) or 9 kda (b. thetaiotaomicron) yellow-staining component. the heterogeneity of lps profiles within the bacteroides genus may reflect the differences in pathogenicity among the species and prove useful for typing.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == rapid differentiation of the species of the genus bacteroides sensu stricto by capillary gas chromatography of cellular carbohydrates.
AB  == whole-cell hydrolysates of bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides castellani and chalmers 1919, and the genetical closely related species b. vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. eggerthii, b. distasonis, b. uniformis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. stercoris, b. merdae, and b. caccae were used to determine characteristic carbohydrate patterns by capillary gas chromatography. on the basis of the chemical derivatization of the carbohydrates seven characteristic peaks for peracetylated aldononitriles and nine characteristic peaks for peracetylated o-methyloximes were selected from the carbohydrate fingerprints of  the reference strains to prepare a dichotomous identification key. the classification of an unknown strain supposed to belong to the formerly called 'bacteroides fragilis group' is possible with this key. some of the advantages of the technique were that the identification of bacteroides fragilis-like strains requires only 4-5 h after primary isolation and that the bacteria can be exposed  to oxygen because viability of the organisms is not necessary. sophisticated anaerobic techniques can therefore be avoided for identification.

AB  == beta-lactamase production (nitrocefin disk method) and agar dilution susceptibility of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole were determined for 320 bacteroides species (not bacteroides fragilis group) and 129 fusobacteria from 28 u.s. centers. overall, 64.7% of bacteroides species and 41.1% of fusobacteria were beta-lactamase positive. among the bacteroides species, positivity rates were highest for b. bivius (85.0%), followed by b. splanchnicus  (83.3%), b. eggerthii (77.8%), and b. oralis (77.1%); 54.5% of black-pigmented bacteroides species were beta-lactamase positive. among the fusobacteria, fusobacterium mortiferum showed the highest rate of beta-lactamase positivity (76.9%). mics of amoxicillin (128 micrograms/ml) and ticarcillin (64 micrograms/ml) for 90% of all beta-lactamase-positive strains were reduced to 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, with the addition of clavulanate. mics of amoxicillin and ticarcillin for 90% of all beta-lactamase-negative strains were 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively, and greater than or equal to 98.4% of the strains were susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. of the beta-lactamase-producing strains, 45.9% were susceptible to amoxicillin at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and 93.4% were susceptible to ticarcillin at less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml; the addition of clavulanate raised the rates to 90.4 and 100%, respectively. all strains were susceptible to cefoxitin,  imipenem, and metronidazole. the activity of amoxicillin against 29 beta-lactamase-producing strains (10 bacteroides species and 19 fusobacteria) was not enhanced by the addition of clavulanate; however, 82.7% of these strains were susceptible to amoxicillin, and all were susceptible to ticarcillin. although beta-lactamase positivity is on the increase in non-b. fragilis group bacteroides species and fusobacteria, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole should be suitable for the treatment of infections with these strains. the addition of clavulanate does not appreciably improve the  efficacy of ticarcillin against these organisms.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.

AB  == we compared 22 bacteroides species by dna-dna homology studies using the s1 endonuclease method. none of the currently defined species shared more than 30% dna homology with any other species examined with the exception of b. buccae and  b. capillus (which along with b. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their dna sequences. two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with dna homology greater than 10%. the first cluster included b. coporis, b. disiens, b. bivius, b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus. the second cluster included b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis. five of the oral species, b. asaccharolyticus, b. gingivalis, b. loescheii, b. intermedius and b. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. these were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as bacteroides species. the dna probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. dna probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. in contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as b. intermedius were identified by the dna probe. the dna probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.

TI  == use of targeted insertional mutagenesis to determine whether chondroitin lyase ii is essential for chondroitin sulfate utilization by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  == bacteroides thetaiotaomicron produces two inducible chondroitin lyases (i and ii) when it is grown on chondroitin sulfate. both enzymes have very similar biochemical properties. to determine whether both enzymes are required for growth on chondroitin sulfate, we constructed a bacteroides suicide vector, pe3-1, and used it to create an insertional mutation that interrupts the chondroitin lyase ii gene of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. pe3-1 contains a 4.4-kilobase cryptic b. eggerthii plasmid (pb8-51), the escherichia coli cloning vector pbr328, and the ecori d fragment from the conjugative b. fragilis plasmid pbf4. a 0.8-kilobase fragment from the center of the b. thetaiotaomicron chondroitin lyase ii gene was inserted in pe3-1 to create peg817. although, peg817 is stably maintained in e. coli and can be mobilized into b. thetaiotaomicron by the incp plasmid r751, peg817 is not maintained as a plasmid in bacteroides spp. when peg817 was mobilized into b. thetaiotaomicron, with selection for a drug marker on peg817, transconjugants were obtained which had peg817 inserted into the chondroitin lyase ii gene. western blot analysis was used to confirm that intact chondroitin  lyase ii is not produced in the mutant. the mutant was able to utilize chondroitin sulfate as a sole source of carbon, although no active chondroitin lyase ii was produced. thus chondroitin lyase i alone appears to be sufficient for growth on chondroitin sulfate. the mutant also had some minor changes in its  outer membrane protein profile. however, there was no evidence that any of the major chondroitin sulfate-associated polypeptides in the outer membrane were affected by the insertion in the chondroitin lyase ii gene.

TI  == [demonstration of a species specific determinant of bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharides using monoclonal antibodies].
AB  == the reactivity of two monoclonal antibodies to bacteroides fragilis was tested (elisa) with 37 strains of b. fragilis, 1 strain each of b. thetaiotaomicron, b.  ovatus, b. vulgatus and b. eggerthii, 1 strain of fusobacterium, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 strains), e coli (8 strains), klebsiella (2 strains), yersinia enterocolitica (1 strain) and lps from salmonella minnesota. both monoclonal antibodies proved to be specific for b. fragilis. the determinants recognized by these antibodies are localized in the lps of this gram-negative anaerobe.

TI  == use of randomly cloned dna fragments for identification of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  == randomly cloned fragments of dna from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were used as hybridization probes for differentiation of b. thetaiotaomicron from closely related bacteroides species. hindiii digestion fragments of dna from b. thetaiotaomicron (type strain) were inserted into plasmid pbr322 and labeled with [alpha-32p]dctp by nick translation. these labeled plasmids were screened for hybridization to hindiii digests of chromosomal dna from type strains of the following human colonic bacteroides species: b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, reference strain 3452-a (formerly part of b. distasonis), bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides eggerthii, and reference strain b5-21 (formerly b. fragilis subsp. a). two of the five cloned fragments hybridized only to dna from b. thetaiotaomicron. each of these two fragments hybridized to the same dna restriction fragment in five strains of b. thetaiotaomicron other than the strain from which the dna was cloned. one of the cloned fragments (pbt2) was further tested for specificity by determining its ability to hybridize to dna from 65 additional strains of colonic bacteroides.

TI  == evaluation of a direct fluorescent antibody staining method for rapid identification of members of the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == a direct fluorescent antibody test kit (fluorotec-f, pfizer inc., new york, new york) designed for rapid identification of members of the bacteroides fragilis group (bfg) was evaluated. tested were 228 clinical specimens (144 direct smears  of clinical material, 14 smears of positive blood cultures, and 70 smears of colonies isolated from clinical material) and 49 reference strains of anaerobic bacteria, including 23 members of the bfg. fluorotec-f detected 68 of 69 (98.5%)  members of the bfg, including 55 b. fragilis, 12 b. thetaiotaomicron, and two b.  ovatus, identified by cultural methods in all clinical specimens. three specimens that yielded b. uniformis also fluoresced. three specimens fluoresced but failed  to yield members of the bfg or b. uniformis on culture. of the 49 reference strains tested, all strains of b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, nd b. uniformis  tested were detected by fluorotec-f, but only five of a total of 14b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, and b. ovatus tested fluoresced. of the 25 reference strains of anaerobic bacteria not belonging to the bfg, none fluoresced except for two strains of b. eggerthii. direct fluorescent antibody staining of smears of clinical specimens suitable for anaerobic culture is a valuable tool for rapid detection of b. fragilis infections.

TI  == neuraminidase production by bacteroidaceae.
AB  == the production of neuraminidase (ec 3.2.1.18) by 77 strains of bacteroidaceae was investigated by techniques previously used to study neuraminidase production by clostridia. conditions for culture and assay of bacteroides fragilis neuraminidase were characterised. the enzyme is predominantly cell associated; it is not calcium dependent and the ph optimum for its production is c. 4.5. most neuraminidase-positive bacteroides strains produced the enzyme well in the test media but a few strains failed to produce it consistently in one or other of the  media. because of these occasional variations, strains were grown and tested in at least two media before being defined as neuraminidase negative. within the b.  fragilis group of species, b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. variabilis were neuraminidase positive while b. eggerthii, b. uniformis and b. splanchnicus were negative. two subspecies of b. melaninogenicus (ss. melaninogenicus and ss. levii) were positive but the other (ss. intermedius) was negative. strains of b. oralis and b. bivius produced the enzyme while b. ruminicola, b. disiens, b. asaccharolyticus and b. corrodens did  not. the microaerophilic b. ochraceus were also positive. none of the fusobacterium or leptotrichia species tested produced neuraminidase. our results  for neuraminidase production are consistent for all strains of each species examined and we suggest that tests for neuraminidase production would be a valuable addition to biochemical tests currently used in taxonomic studies of the bacteroidaceae.

TI  == influence of heme and vitamin b12 on growth and fermentations of bacteroides species.
AB  == we examined the effects of heme on the growth and fermentations of bacteroides species. bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285 required heme for growth and produced malate and lactate as major products of glucose fermentation when the concentration of heme was 1 ng/ml. with 1 microgram of heme per ml, malate was not formed, lactate production decreased, and succinate and acetate were the major fermentation products. b. eggerthii atcc 27754 grew without heme, with the  production of mainly malate and lactate from glucose. its fermentation with 1 microgram of heme per ml was similar to that of b. fragilis grown with the same concentration of heme. b. splanchicus vpi 6842 grew without heme, with the production of mainly malate, acetate, and h2 from glucose. with 1 microgram of heme per ml, malate disappeared, h2 decreased significantly, and succinate, acetate, and butyrate were the major products. the addition of vitamin b12 to media containing 1 microgram of heme per ml caused all species to produce propionate at the expense of succinate and, with b. splanchnicus, also at the expense of butyrate. thus, the concentration of heme and the presence of vitamin  b12 significantly influenced the course of glucose fermentation by these bacteria.

TI  == the isolation and identification of bacteroides spp. from the normal human faecal flora.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli of the bacteroides group were isolated on an enriched selective medium from specimens of faeces from 20 normal healthy adults  and identified by conventional bacteriological methods. a heavy growth of bacteroides spp. was obtained from all specimens and 10 representative colonies from each subject were identified. most isolates (84%) belonged to the b. fragilis group. the commonest species identified in this group were b vulgatus and b. thetaiotaomicron (22% each), b. distasonis (18%) and the b. eggerthii/variabilis complex (14%), and only 9% were b. fragilis. b. vulgatus was isolated from 80% of subjects, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. distasonis from 70% each and the b. eggerthii/variabilis complex from 65%, but b. fragilis was detected in only 45% of specimens. asaccharolytic species were isolated in smaller numbers from 14 (70%) subjects, but only five strains of the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group were isolated and fusobacteria were not detected.
