TI  == allosteric regulation of rhomboid intramembrane proteolysis.
AB  == proteolysis within the lipid bilayer is poorly understood, in particular the regulation of substrate cleavage. rhomboids are a family of ubiquitous intramembrane serine proteases that harbour a buried active site and are known to cleave transmembrane substrates with broad specificity. in vitro gel and forster  resonance energy transfer (fret)-based kinetic assays were developed to analyse cleavage of the transmembrane substrate pstata (tata from providencia stuartii).  we demonstrate significant differences in catalytic efficiency (kcat/k0.5) values for transmembrane substrate pstata (tata from providencia stuartii) cleavage for  three rhomboids: aara from p. stuartii, ecglpg from escherichia coli and higlpg from haemophilus influenzae demonstrating that rhomboids specifically recognize this substrate. furthermore, binding of pstata occurs with positive cooperativity. competitive binding studies reveal an exosite-mediated mode of substrate binding, indicating allostery plays a role in substrate catalysis. we reveal that exosite formation is dependent on the oligomeric state of rhomboids,  and when dimers are dissociated, allosteric substrate activation is not observed. we present a novel mechanism for specific substrate cleavage involving several dynamic processes including positive cooperativity and homotropic allostery for this interesting class of intramembrane proteases.

TI  == gemifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gemifloxacin is a dual targeted fluoroquinolone with potent in vitro activity against gram-positive, -negative and atypical human pathogens--pathogens considered to be important causes of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. gemifloxacin demonstrates impressive minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic 90 ) values against clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae and legionella spp., with mic 90 values reported to be 0.016-0.06, < 0.0008-0.06, 0.008-0.3, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.016-0.07 microg/ml, respectively. gemifloxacin is also active in vitro against a broad range of gram-negative bacilli with mic 90 values against the enterobacteriaceae in the range of 0.016 to > 16 microg/ml ( escherichia coli and providencia stuartii, respectively), with the majority of the genus having mic 90 drug concentrations < 0.5 microg/ml. the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against anaerobic organisms is variable. the mic values  for gemifloxacin are not affected by beta-lactamase production nor by penicillin  or macrolide resistance in s. pneumoniae. gemifloxacin is approved by the fda to  be clinically efficacious against multi-drug resistant s. pneumoniae. the pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin are such that the drug can be administered orally once-daily to yield or achieve sustainable drug concentrations exceeding the mic values of clinically important organisms. gemifloxacin has been shown to  target both dna gyrase (preferred target) and topoisomerase iv (secondary target) - enzymes critical for dna replication and organism survival - against clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. this dual targeting activity is thought to be important for reducing the likelihood for selecting for quinolone resistance. gemifloxacin has been investigated and approved for therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. in one study, more patients receiving gemifloxacin compared to clarithromycin remained free of exacerbations for longer periods of time (p < 0.016) and gemifloxacin had a shorter time to eradication of h. influenzae than did clarithromycin (p < 0.02). from efficacy studies, gemifloxacin was found to have  an adverse profile that was comparable with other compounds. the most frequent side effects were diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. gemifloxacin is a welcomed addition to currently available agents for the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. other potential indications appear to be within the spectrum of this compound.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == aarc, an essential gene involved in density-dependent regulation of the 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii.
AB  == the 2'-n-acetyltransferase [aac(2')-ia] in providencia stuartii has a dual function where it is involved in the acetylation of peptidoglycan and certain aminoglycosides. a search for negative regulators of the aac(2')-ia gene has resulted in the identification of aarc. a missense allele (aarc1) resulted in an  8.9-fold increase in beta-galactosidase accumulation from an aac(2')-lacz transcriptional fusion. northern blot analysis demonstrated an increase in aac(2')-ia mrna accumulation that was specific to cells at high density. in addition, the aarc1 allele also resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of aarp, a transcriptional activator of the aac(2')-ia gene. the wild-type aarc gene was isolated by complementation and encodes a predicted protein of 365 amino acids with a molecular mass of 39,815 da. the predicted aarc protein exhibited 88% amino acid homology to the previously identified gcpe protein of escherichia coli and 86% homology to a gene product from haemophilus influenzae. the e. coli gcpe gene was able to functionally complement the aarc1 allele in p. stuartii. the aarc1 allele was identified as a t to g transversion that resulted in a valine to glycine substitution at position 136 in the aarc protein. the aarc gene appears to be essential for cell viability as construction of a disrupted copy (aarc::lacz) was possible only in cells that carried an episomal copy of aarc or gcpe.

TI  == a multicenter comparative study of the in vitro activity of fleroxacin and other  antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fleroxacin was determined by broth microdilution against 2,079 recent bacterial isolates and compared to the activities of ciprofloxacin,  ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx), and, as appropriate, erythromycin and oxacillin. most enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by the quinolones at a concentration of < or = 1 microgram/ml; mic90s of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin were 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively. fleroxacin was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens. aside from the quinolones,  ceftriaxone and tmp-smx were the most active antibiotics against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic90s of 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. ciprofloxacin was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other quinolones, while fleroxacin was more active against stenotrophomonas maltophilia: 17.7, 11.2, 20.0, and 22.4% of p. aeruginosa were resistant to fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were uniformally susceptible to all antibiotics tested, as were the majority of oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci.  the mic90s of the quinolones and of the beta-lactam antibiotics for oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were 8- to 256-fold higher than for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. the beta-lactam antibiotics, tmp-smx, and erythromycin were more active than the quinolones against streptococci; all antibiotics were poorly active against enterococci. fleroxacin is active against  a broad range of gram-negative bacilli and against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and should prove useful for such infections. however, its use cannot be recommended for infections due to oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, or enterococci.

TI  == cefquinome (hr 111v). in vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
AB  == cefquinome (formerly hr 111v), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest mic (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and providencia stuartii strains. a total of 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by  cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome activity of particular note for  gram-positive isolates included corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (mic50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than  oxacillin-susceptible (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus species (mic90, <  or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). when tested against organisms possessing bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (mic, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. this compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == studies to optimize the in vitro testing of piperacillin combined with tazobactam (ytr 830).
AB  == the combination of piperacillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (formerly ytr 830) was studied to determine optimal disk concentrations and dilution testing conditions. in addition, the potency of the combination was compared to that of piperacillin alone. the spectrum of piperacillin was greatly  expanded by the addition to tazobactam principally against beta-lactamase producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii, shigella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus spp. tazobactam was active alone against branhamella catarrhalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] 50, less than or  equal to 1 microgram/ml), gonococci (mic 50, 0.5-4 micrograms/ml), and n. meningitidis (mic 50, less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). studies with beta-lactamase-producing type strains showed tazobactam to have high affinity for plasmid-mediated enzymes (tem-1 and 2, shv-1, hms-1, and some carb or oxa types)  and not chromosomal beta-lactamases. piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited 93% of fluoro-quinolone resistant strains at less than or equal to 64/8 micrograms/ml but failed to suppress the growth of 15 strains producing stably depressed cephalosporinases. comparisons of piperacillin/tazobactam results determined with 100/10-, 100/20-, and 100/30-micrograms disks established the 100/10-micrograms disk as most usable. among five different mic combinations the ratio of eight parts piperacillin to one part tazobactam or fixed concentration tests at greater than or equal to 4 micrograms tazobactam/ml were preferred, each producing very low occurrences (less than or equal to 1.6%) of false-resistance or -susceptibility when compared to disk test results. mics determined by agar and broth microdilution methods were essentially the same. the recommended breakpoints for piperacillin/tazobactam mics were identical to those now found in the nccls susceptibility testing standards with the following exceptions: (1) for tests with h. influenzae and staphylococcus spp.--susceptible at greater than or  equal to 21 mm (mic less than or equal to 16/2 micrograms/ml) and resistant less  than or equal to 20 mm (mic less or equal to 32/4 micrograms/ml); and (2) all remaining nonspeudomonas isolates would be interpreted by the nccls piperacillin  enteric bacilli susceptibility criteria. this newer beta-lactamase inhibitor combination appears to be worthy of further in vivo trials guided by these or similar tentative in vitro susceptibility testing parameters.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefetamet, the microbiologically active metabolite of the orally administered prodrug cefetamet pivoxil, was compared with that of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and amoxicillin. cefetamet was highly active against enterobacteriaceae, neisseria spp., vibrio spp., haemophilus influenzae and streptococci other than enterococci. cefetamet inhibited cefaclor-resistant species such as proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri and  serratia marcescens. staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-overproducing strains of enterobacter cloacae were resistant to  cefetamet. the superior activity of cefetamet compared with older oral beta-lactam antibiotics against a large number of gram-negative pathogens correlated with enhanced stability towards beta-lactamases. in accordance with the in vitro findings, cefetamet pivoxil showed good activity in experimental infections in the mouse and rat, suggesting satisfactory bioavailability in these animals after oral administration.

TI  == disk diffusion susceptibility testing for ly163892 (kt-3777), a new orally administered 1-carbacephem.
AB  == ly163892, a new orally administered 1-carbacephem, was found to have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity very similar to that of cefaclor. diffusion tests with  30-micrograms ly163892 disks produced acceptable interpretive error rates with greater than or equal to 22 mm as the susceptibility zone diameter. this was required to reduce potential false-susceptibility results, particularly among enterobacter spp. and providencia stuartii: both species included strains that produce beta-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing ly163892. preliminary recommendations for ly163892 disk tests are presented, but the continued use of the 30-micrograms cephalothin "class representative" disk might be the best procedure to minimize ly163892 interpretive errors for clinical trials. a separate ly163892 disk for testing haemophilus influenzae strains should be seriously considered.

TI  == dna probe technology for detection of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == a 5 kb haemophilus influenzae dna fragment involved in penicillin-binding proteins expression was used as a probe for specific detection of h. influenzae strains. the 32p-labeled probe specificity was assessed by hybridization to bacterial dots and 75 strains were tested. all h. influenzae (18) and h. aegyptius (1) strains reacted very strongly with the probe. the h. influenzae serotypes tested (a, b, and non-typable strains) did not differ in their hybridization. some hybridization was also found with the 12 other haemophilus species tested as well as other pasteurellaceae such as actinobacillus lignieresii and pasteurella multocida. two other less related species (klebsiella ozaenae and providencia stuartii) also showed low hybridization. the probe detected as low as 10(5)-10(6) h. influenzae cells and 0.1 microgram of dna in a  dot sensitivity test. hybridization to electroblotted, digested dna from different species which reacted in the bacterial dot test revealed strong hybridization to h. influenzae and h. aegyptius only. this dna probe should prove useful for h. influenzae and possibly h. aegyptius detection due to its high specificity and sensitivity under stringent hybridization conditions.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, b0-1165.
AB  == b0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. it inhibited the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and salmonella and shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the mics for individual isolates. enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime had mics that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. b0-1165 had activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. pseudomonas maltophilia and other pseudomonas species were resistant or had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, as did acinetobacter species. b0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as clostridium and bacteroides species. b0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally richmond-sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. it inhibited the enterobacter cloacae p99 and inducible pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. b0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing e. cloacae and c. freundii to b0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. overall, b0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of  other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
