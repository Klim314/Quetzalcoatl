TI  == antimicrobial activities of active component isolated from lawsonia inermis leaves and structure-activity relationships of its analogues against food-borne bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of lawsonia inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues against food-borne bacteria. the antimicrobial activities of five fractions derived from the methanol extract of lawsonia inermis leaves were evaluated against 7 food-borne bacteria. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was isolated by chromatographic analyses. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone showed the strong activities against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s. intermedius, but exerted no growth-inhibitory  activities against s. typhimurium. the antimicrobial activities of the 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues were tested against 7 food-borne bacteria  to establish structure-activity relationships. hydroxyl (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), methoxy (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and methyl (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) functional groups on the 1,4-naphthoquinone skeleton possessed potent activities, whereas bromo (2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-naphthoquione) and chloro (2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone) exhibited no activity against 7 food-borne bacteria. the l. inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues  should be useful as natural antimicrobial agents against food-borne bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of phyllantus emblica, coriandrum sativum, culinaris medic, lawsonia alba and cucumis sativus.
AB  == present study deals with the demonstration of the antibacterial activity of very  common medicinal plants of pakistani origin i.e., phyllantus emblica, coriandrum  sativum, culinaris medic, lawsonia alba and cucumis sativus. the extracts were prepared in crude form by the use of hydro-alcoholic solution and were screened for antibacterial activity against various bacterial species by disk diffusion method. assay was performed using clinical isolates of b. cereus, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and e. coli. crude extract of phyllantus emblica fruit exhibited strong activity against standard cultures of all studied bacteria. lawsonia alba  showed good activity against standard cultures of all the used microorganisms. coriandrum sativum was effective only against bacillus cereus, while cucumis sativus and culinaris medic showed poor activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa only. hence, phyllantus emblica exhibited strong antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria it means that phyllantus emblica extract contains some compounds which have broad spectrum of bactericidal activity.
