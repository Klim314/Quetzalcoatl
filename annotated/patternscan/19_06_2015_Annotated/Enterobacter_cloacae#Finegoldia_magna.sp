TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2009 to march 2010 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 671 strains including 16 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 174 (79.1%) of 220 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and eleven strains were isolated from primary infections, and 244 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli  was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae. among  anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, streptococcus constellatus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections,  followed by bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by b. ovatus, b. wadsworthia and b. thetaiotaomicron, in this order. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa.  we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == we studied the serum bactericidal activity (sba) of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against common pathogens associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections.  ten healthy volunteers received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (750 mg) and serum samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h after the dose of each drug. bactericidal titers in serum over time were determined for aerobic gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebseilla pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae) and anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella bivia, and finegoldia magna).  both fluoroquinolones provided rapid (2h) attainment and prolonged (24h) sba (titers > or = 1:8) against each of the aerobic bacilli studied. sba was observed for at least 12h against b. fragilis strains with mics < or = 2 microg/ml to moxifloxacin and < or = 4 microg/ml to levofloxacin. prolonged (12h) sba (titers  > or = 1:2) was also observed against isolates of b. thetaiotaomicron, p. bivia,  and f. magna with moxifloxacin < or = mics 2 microg/ml.
